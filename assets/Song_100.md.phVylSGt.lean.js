belief i don t know if you ve noticed but there s a direct corellation between your profession of faith and your expressions of grace to the hopeless yeah it s true that all men are broken but to only help the healthy would make us miss the open wounds that matter the most in those moments the deconstruction of dignity buried deep in the heart of assumptions where selective justice is just another name for social corruption a system is flawed when just cause is just because but even a man at odds with the law is made in the image of god it s admitted that none of us are innocent all of us complicit but to solicit the silence of injustice doesn t just dismiss it and just in case you forgot christ will come at just the right time a divine king bringing perfect justice to judge all of mankind the only difference between us i ll stay seated at jesus feet and rest between the span of his hands where justice and mercy meet there s a virus in my iris i was blinded close my eyelids see my savior laying down his righteous life and saying i forgive virus in my iris deep down i know my eyes are sick the wrath of god is coming can you hear the warning joy comes in the morning but now is a time of mourning when all i m seeing lately is a nation going crazy looking bad needs some hope like the words maybe if or probably but if i m honest in light of all these problems if my hope is only probable how long til it dissolves i don t have the capacity to see these problems solved i take comfort knowing that my god is still involved that s my certainty when the road i m on is serpentine and i m threatened by the serpent s sting the evil one is prowling looking to devour but no one can usurp the king lord have mercy while we re waiting for the final hour this is my father s world it s also a fallen one the domino effect has infected the whole set up i m not afraid to talk about social injustices let s also talk about the throne where perfect justice is it sounds insensitive and some will hate the stench of it but the church is not faithful if we fail to mention it we worship a god who can speak to the world s pain because salvation for us came through the lamb who was slain  there s a virus in my iris i was blinded close my eyelids see my savior laying down his righteous life and saying i forgive virus in my iris deep down i know my eyes are

where we left off dealing of sickness disease and hunger now thats fundamental if you want to end terrorism you have to stop being terrorists which is what war is they told you world war ii was a peoples war logic should have told them it was imperialist war 18 million served in the armed forces 10 million more overseas thats enormous 25 million workers paid for war bonds all of the while people question why the wars on there was an undercurrent of reluctance there were under publicized signs of resistance hitlers germany was unspeakable evil but lets discuss real quick what we did to people we opposed the haitian revolution we turned guam puerto rico and hawaii into institutions pretended to help cuba win freedom from spain this countrys built on the blood of other peoples pain blacks is looking at anti semitism in germany and saw the situation here was mirroring it perfectly we appeased hitler all throughout the 30s only years later we pretended we was worried roosevelt was hesitant to be gritty and caused a resolution to be buried in committee the main interest was never to stop fascism but advancing imperialist interests of that prism roosevelt aint care about oppression of the jews the power was the priority im telling you the truth hitler not the reason that we entered the land roosevelt was mad that we got hit by japan historians will tell you he provoked that shit he told lies in attempts to sugar coat that shit in 45 troops were jammed onto the queen mary the blacks were stowed down in the depths of the same ferry see theres a parallel you have to understand that they wanted them to fight but wouldnt treat them like a man industrial mobilization had a few divided the economic royalists denounced and derided the irony of victory was heavily a price the war ended 3 million men was in strike theres no peace in a world of capitalism nazi eugenics economic rationalism the lesson was that war solved problems of control regardless if it causes any problems for the soul  the black revolt in the 50s came as a surprise it shouldnt have after we took so many of their lives you cant erase the memory of an oppressed people reparation doesnt make it any less evil some black folks joined the communist party richard wright spoke of disillusionment with the body the party was accused of exploiting black people angelo herndon felt everything was equal he was arrested they convicted for insurrection how the fuck its insurrection i call it dissension gave him 5 years when all he wanted was protection there was other black men that made the same connection benjamin davis defended herndon as a savior then paul robeson he only magnified the danger harry truman had to deal with the militant mood but how the fuck that gonna work when he a racist too in 54 they said they ended segregation 10 years later no changes revolt was always minutes away about to bust rosa parks refused the black section of the bus the freedom riders were spreading across the nation they went to jail for marching and fighting discrimination fbi stood by justice department stood by while civil rights workers were beaten they just stood by 3 civil rights workers 2 black and 1 white arrested in philadelphia mississippi one night they were released beaten with chains and shot to death there were arrests made but it was not confessed the national government remained silent the president wouldnt defend blacks against violence civil rights laws were passed but they were fraud equality was enforced poorly or was ignored martin luther kings speech floored whoever heard it 5 years later he was targeted and murdered in 65 the watts riots burned into the streets the black man would no longer turn the other cheek the black panther party scared nixon but that did nothing to change his position a new black consciousness was born and still alive and that came from the will to survive this is the part where i would talk about vietnam but me and rugged man we already made a song by the 70s distrust had spread across the nation basic discontent political alienation 55 000 died in the war of moral shame and then watergate was added to the hall of pain the watergate burglaries was rather complicated but in the end mostly all of them exonerated nixon had cia and g gordon liddy lie about the democratic national committee but eventually they all flipped on him and told the senate that they had a lot of shit on him after that it was a swift and a sudden fall nixon resigned before they could impeach them all they got rid of nixon but they kept the system his foreign policy still remains in position corporate interests still remained in position his closest advisors remain in position vietnam recession and unrest all adds up to a motherfucking mess after watergate and vietnam there was a deep economic insecurity in this world of ours environmental deterioration took its toll a cultural violence upon the families took its toll problems couldnt be solved without bold changes but no major party candidates proposed changes american political tradition held fast urban communities turning into hell fast black folks are bitterly disappointed with carter opposed federal aid the poor people didnt bother reagan got elected and he built a military up a trillion dollars later and this motherfucker dummy up he cut benefits

didn t treat her like a good neighbor would man harassin her for the clothes that her mom supplied the first couple times they did it she cried after a while she d take in stride walking down hall between classes she d let it all slide swallowing her pride to the point that it was full eaten after school getting bullied and beaten but to her mom she made none of it known she figured that her mother already had enough problems of her own she came home one day to a new face a man in her living room unpacking his suit case her mom said he s going to stay with us for a while at the news mary cracked a smile she figured he d be like a dad or maybe an older brother he can stay as long as he likes she told her mother and at first it was kinda nice everybody got along for the most parts just a couple minor fights but as the months went on it got worse if he didn t get his way he d scream and curse mary never knew this was how a father behaved it was less father and daughter and more master and slave all the money mom saved he would blow getting bent broke open her piggy bank stole every cent he would come home drunk and snort lines in the living room openly some nights he lost control totally he d grab her mom by the neck and ice grill her and tell her that if she ever left him he would kill her and mary would listen all alone from her room shaking too much for a little girl to take in but the worse of it all was yet to come the new habit he developed was a devilish one she ain t know what he was doing but she knew it wasn t right when he came into her room in the middle of the night man she started keeping something in her night stand something she found in the kitchen by the frying pan she was in a new mental state ready to release all of the anger and pent up hate and she swore when he came to her door she wouldn t take it lying down like she had before she kept the knife in the drawer with the handle sticking out next time he came in she chickened out so she decided she would hide it in a place much closer somewhere she could grab it as soon as he approached her put it under the pillow and she was ready the next time he came in she wielded it like a machete you could tell by the way that she swung that she had practiced shadow stabbing in her mirror for the past six weeks her confidence level had peaked the first slice to the dick then she stabbed him in the cheek and she didn t stop stabbing even when he stopped screaming still stabbing and sticking even when he stopped breathing her mom ran in and she screamed in horror as she slipped and she fell on the blood covered floor screaming mary stick em ha ha ha stick em mary stick em ha ha ha stick em mary stick em ha ha ha stick em ma ma ma mom i m done being a

your brain things change now i just want to control all this rage there was a moment in time when i swore to my mom that i d shoot a cop s face off or put a bomb in the middle of a federal court house in the name of trayvon when they glue your eyelids to your forehead and tape your mouth shut you can t say much so i m just gonna keep faith in what i love oh oh my my is there anything better that we can ever achieve in this whole whole lifetime i don t want to be another martyr for a cause that never grows grows wide wide don t tell me everything is gonna work out fine i could never find the time to design a time machine or rewind back into a better life those those bright lights all they re ever gonna do is blind eyes only really want to redefine my life as it sits on this timeline when i die i will explode into the night and take a few stars with me to show this world i put up a fight try try try again s easy to say when nobody s pulling teeth out of your bloody face with a razor to your neck watching you suffocate it ll be okay that s what they all say there is a fire that won t stop burning try try try i swear i tried my best but was left on the side of the road with a hole inside my chest and a heart can only beat so fast fore it decides to rest when it s been so stressed and it feels like you re fighting for a single breath am i becoming an animal clawing away underneath my cage expecting to find something better outside of this world when i reach the grave when the nihilism sneaks into my brain will i still keep on trying to convince myself that a human race can change

felt numb when the tears have welled up in my eyes bruises swelled up grow those great seeds vines can wrap around enemies i don t mind if no one remembers me but don t let this fire end with me they can try to kill every single goal i ve ever had i ll just watch and laugh knowing that all vines grow back","is_english":"True","genres_list":"['abstract hip hop', 'underground

the hand spins on the clock i never seem to miss it tic toc i can t shut it off my mind spinnin a mile a minute it never stops i must be wired wrong cause nothing feel right i guess i ll never know if this is real life and what you need ain t what you get all i need is a little sleep a little dream a little rest just to close my eyes and give the night away i let the feelin go do it every day no i can t sleep i know it ll never let me down my mind races still i don t wanna touch the ground i stay high in a room full of snakes you doomed if you don t so i do what it takes i got that telly flicked on and that celly flicked off i got that belly sick going and i m feelin pissed off cause every second is a second of regret and i can never plan the week cause i don t know what to expect what s next when you don t know the days are passing the memories fade together and you don t know just what happened your friends they ignore ya or maybe it s paranoia you feel the same well maybe you should enjoy it cause i don t trust nobody and myself do the math add it up that leaves nobody to help i can sing a song bout the moon and the stars bout the dream and the sky and the truth in my heart at this point i can t really see the meanin there s nothing in the cars and there s nothing left to reason look into my eyes nobody is home nobody is listenin nobody but ommz no i can t sleep i know it ll never let me down my mind races still i don t wanna touch the ground i stay high in a room full of snakes you doomed if you don t so i do what it takes","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

that has ever hurt you and the pain inside and smile as bright as the sunshine even though it may rain at times love is scared and love is sanctified it is what brought peace to the world in ancient times love is the same energy that created the universe and paints the sky love is the reason that birds sing at night and angels fly love is intellectual conversations that make our brains collide love can really make you go insane at times love is a thing inside that makes anger die love told me to love myself and then i became sublime love even gave life to frankenstein love just cant really be explained sometimes love is this and everything that i cant describe love is everything everything is love everything is love you know you get a galaxy sized object inside you that you can access and there there are the mountains the rivers the jungles the dynastic families the ruins the planets the works of arts the poetry the sciences the magics of millions upon millions upon millions of worlds and this is apparently who we each are we re a little bit of eternity sticking into three dimensional space and for some reason occupying time in a monkey body you know love is a beautiful

there is nothing like love i wouldn t trade love for the world love is spiritual love is an art yeah i mean you gotta understand that is just my take on it but when you turn your eyes then inward you discover the birth right the existential facts out of which this particular existence emerged and it s a great secret a great secret and a great comfort because it means you know mystery didn t die with the fall of arthur or the fall of atlantis or the fall of anything mystery is alive in the moment in the here and now it just simply lies on the other side of a barrier of courage and it isn t even that high of barrier it s just is a barrier high enough to keep out the insincere and the misdirected but for those who will claim it in midst of the historical chaos in the late 20th century they become the archaic pioneers they become the first people to carry the ouroboric serpent around to its own tail and to make a closure and to the degree that any one of us has this connection back to the archaic in our life it makes were we have been make a lot more sense and it makes were we re going seem a lot more inviting which it really is i think love is intellectual conversations that

and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that i might teach you take my arms that i might reach you but my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence and the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made

farewells a bid lets take one last spin in last years whip just to get excited for next years ride for a sec i reflect on all of my lows and highs like hov and nas i made amends with some friends and some friends have come to an end so when i stopped at bus stops some couldnt get in hey it is what it is and we couldnt pretend i have three beautiful mothers two beautiful kids and one beautiful crib where i live man gods been good to me birthday a beach and the breeze every oleg day was a sight to be seen a lot of goals werent achieved i wont grieve cuz every day ive been blessed to breathe as for me and the leaves last year dropped our own cd blood i wish you were here to see dad i miss you and you know how your sons love you im seeing myself in the places where i once saw you so i struggle at times not to be ourselves i see your signs from heaven when we need help so i bail for that new wheel shine and chromed out my resolve for new probs and plans to drive out at the square theyre counting down but dont count me out because thats what lifes about say goodbye to yesterday say goodbye with a smile to yesterday verse 3 december 22 is the day i tell em about an angel by the name of helen and how her life served as my perfect guide much like her sweet kind soul inside seems to lift up my awareness high to a point not far behind 365 rewind a new chapter begins laughters not wearing thin and on and on the weeks go by stress on the rise collapse now well disguised meanwhile three days out the week blood is cleaned and leaves her very drained and week and when you work 14 hour days or right through the night till the next morning says hey and on through the next workday life begins to feel like its across the way but when a memory fills you with hope and smile then its from a good life and despite the trials and tribulations these were days when her soft heart would change men no imitation ive been blessed by your patience touched by your strength when you became faced with a fate no one would soon take but if given the chance would damn sure have booked straight left it vacant now your time on this plane was sacred and the last years of your stay a gift if i could just say i wish you well i wish you

quietly as the light lies on these white walls this bed these hands i am nobody i have nothing to do with explosions i have given my name and my day clothes up to the nurses and my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet cuff like an eye between two white lids that will not shut stupid pupil it has to take everything in the nurses pass and pass they are no trouble they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps doing things with their hands one just the same as another so it is impossible to tell how many there are my body is a pebble to them they tend it as water tends to the pebbles it must run over smoothing them gently they bring me numbness in their bright needles they bring me sleep now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox my husband and child smiling out of the family photo their smiles catch onto my skin little smiling hooks i have let things slip a thirty year old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations scared and bare on the green plastic pillowed trolley i watched my teaset my bureaus of linen my books sink out of sight and the water went over my head i am a nun now i have never been so pure i didnt want any flowers i only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty how free it is you have no idea how free the peacefulness is so big it dazes you and it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets it is what the dead close on finally i imagine them shutting their mouths on it like a communion tablet the tulips are too red in the first place they hurt me even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe lightly through their white swaddlings like an awful baby their redness talks to my wound it corresponds they are subtle they seem to float though they weigh me down upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck nobody watched me before now i am watched the tulips turn to me and the window behind me where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins and i see myself flat ridiculous a cut paper shadow between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips and i have no face i have wanted to efface myself the vivid tulips eat my oxygen before they came the air was calm enough coming and going breath by breath without any fuss then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river snags and eddies round a sunken rust red engine they concentrate my attention that was happy playing and resting without committing itself the walls also seem to be warming themselves the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat and i am aware of my heart it opens and closes its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me the water i taste is warm and salt like the sea and comes from a country far away as health

welcome friend there s room for more soon they re standing there inside together he said i heard that tune before somewhere but i can t remember when was it on some other friendly shore did i hear it on the wind was it written on the sky above i think i heard it from someone i love but i never heard it sound so sweet since then now his feet begin to tap a little boy says i ll take your hat he s caught up in the magic of his smile then leaps the heart inside him when on and off across the floor he sends his clumsy body graceful as a child he says there s magic in the fiddler s arms there s magic in this town there s magic in the dancers feet and the way they put them down smiling people everywhere boots and ribbons and locks of hair laughter and old blue suits and easter gowns now the sailor s gone the room is bare the old piano s sitting there someone s hat s left hanging on the rack some empty chairs a wooden floor that feels the touch of shoes no more waiting for the dancers to come back and the fiddle s in the closet of some daughter of the town the strings are broke the bow is gone and the case is buttoned down but often on december nights when the air is cold and the wind is right for the melody comes passing through this

worked them up till i thought we played them all just right the first gig that we ever played i stayed out too long then we went out and partied and we stayed up till dawn the next night at the club i didn t show the bartender said hey let em go i got lucky with some songs and they were hits on the radio promoters said they needed some gonzo stuff for the country package show the record company said that they were caught by surprise they said you guys are really hard to categorize i don t think that they ever caught our show they just let us go well i ve traveled round the world and sang my
