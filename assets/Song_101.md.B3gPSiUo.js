each tide and each bright mountain rising but now the boys are away and such kicks they are having slashing away at the forest walls with their bitter knives sparks bloom in their eyes and they never look tired will they never look tired on cliffs that tower from the rising seas their bonfire glow where a tiger lies and cleaning their weapons they laugh at his useless claws and all it is a

garments made of light as darkness fled before him he divided day from night he fastened earth s foundations laid its cornerstone he shut the sea behind its doors and made its bound ries known he spoke of grass and herbs and trees and seeds that fall and fly and roots thrust deep into the earth and branches to the sky the chorus of the morning stars and the shouts of heaven s sons resound throughout the skyfields while the work of god is done and as he sows his words like jewels in a rainbow falling down the garden is perfection and awaits creation s crown then in glory unimaginable the lord himself is here he kneels and there beneath his hands a man from dust appears he lifts him gently in his arms and breaths into his soul and raises him to stand upright complete and free and whole the man looks round in wonder at the world that s now his own and everything that s touched and seen is beauty yet unknown with a joy that has no bounds and knows no fear of end every evening in its coolness he walks there with his friend the pow r that formed the universe was but a token of his might it was love that gave us ears to hear and eyes to see the light it s love that gave us breath and it is love that gave us birth it s love that flung the stars and it is love that spins the earth and when at last this vastness like a worn out robe is rolled and the new creation s

time became a knife that slowly and relentlessly cut the cord of life there was a teacher in the region then some of us had heard that he d healed the paralytic by the power of just his word so with hope again rekindled i went at once to see if i could find a man named jesus from a town in galilee i began to search the city and soon i saw the crowd they were pressing in to touch him and they called his name out loud but with the strength of desperation i pushed them all aside i through myself before him and from my knees i cried lord come and heal my daughter even now she s close to death her fever s uncontrollable she fights for every breath but god s given you the power life is yours to give if you ll just lay your hands on her i know that she will live well he d just begun to go with me when a face i saw with fear came towards me with the news i knew i didn t want to hear and although i tried to steel myself i trembled when he said why bother the teacher anymore your little girl is dead then jesus touched my shoulder and he told me not to grieve the trembling stopped when he looked at me and said only believe then he sent the crowds away except his closest men and they followed right behind us as we started off again but we were still a long ways down the road when i heard the sounds and cries of the mourners and musicians as they strove to dramatize my grief they had no business with beneath their loud disguise my wife just sat there silently and stared through empty eyes then jesus asked the mourners why is it that you weep she isn t dead as you suppose the child is just asleep it only took a moment for their wails to turn to jeers who does this man think he is get him out of here with authority i ve never heard in the lips of any man he spoke and every sound rolled out with the thunder of command and in the sudden silence they all hurried for the door wondering what the reasons were they d ever come there for then he called his three disciples that were with him on the way he led them and my wife and me to where our daughter lay he took her by the hand he told her child arise and the words were barely spoken when she opened up her eyes she rose and walked across the room and stood there at our sides my wife knelt down and held her close and at last she really cried and then jesus told us both to see that our daughter had some food but as to how her life was saved not to speak a word not to speak a word i got to tell somebody i got to tell somebody i got to tell somebody i got to tell somebody i got to tell somebody got to tell somebody

filled my brain for i knew what they intended i could not face the pain then soldiers came into the cell and they dragged me to the yard they threw me down before a cross and brought the whip down hard carry it they shouted as i struggled to my feet i put my shoulder under it and dragged it to the street i stumbled through a wall of screams as they drove me through the gate i could see the thousands lined the street their voices filled with hate like a wolf pack in the night that moves in for the kill they closed the gap in front of us as we started up the hill and it seemed i d barely reached the top as they grabbed me from behind they threw the cross under me and tied the ropes that bind the arms close to the beams as they nailed the feet and hands and they raised the cross up in the air and dropped it in it s stand through a blur of pain i saw the cross there next to mine there were people all around it so i looked to read the sign it was nailed there up above his head so the world could see the news the man who seemed so helpless there was the king of all the jews and the crowd that stood around his cross made jokes about his name they shouted laughed and spat on him so i joined in the game i said hey if you re the king why don t you get us down from here but the taunt just sounded hollow it echoed in my ears as he looked at me with eyes that seemed to reach into my heart they shone a light on all my lies and tore my life apart there was more that lay behind that gaze then simply mud and clay but knowing was too much for me i had to look away but i chanced another look at him while he was lookin down where the soldiers who just crucified us drank there on the ground and although he spoke there quietly somehow his words came through he said father please forgive them they don t know what they do and then as if they heard him speakin the crowd began to roar with the frenzy by the priests who herds them on to more but the worse the accusations the plainer i could see the guilt of the accusers not the one there next to me but the one on the other cross began to curse and swear and his voice was filled with venom as he hurled it through the air all the horror that was in him it laid his life to waste came out of every syllable he flung in jesus face jesus only looked at him but somethin rolls inside o me in spite of all that watched us there it couldn t be denied because his righteousness and innocence were shining bright and strong i just couldn t keep my silence as that cursing still went on i said don t you fear the wrath of god even at the end you ll curse us both into the pit is that what you intend we re only getting what we re due send our whole lives long but don t you talk to him that way cause he s done nothin wrong then with all my courage in a voice not my own i asked him lord remember me when you come into your throne he answered me and even then his love was undisguised he said before the sun will set today you ll be with me in paradise the shouts and curses did not stop even when the sunlight ceased but somehow in the midst of it my soul had been released though the agony continued it s still too small a price
