really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i m sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there s a time in every man s life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay z and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jay z i ain t want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it and i was like man that shit tight you know what i m sayin man what i ma tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man i m i m just in chicago i m trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts i m trying to get on and like there wasn t nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like i m just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain t have to deal with the landlord cause he s a jerk me and my mother drove to newark new jersey i hadn t even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooooooooooh two days later i m in baseline and i seen dame dame didn t know who i was and i was like yo what s up i m kanye you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats you know i ain t talkin shit i m like oh shit and all this time i m starstruck man i m still thinking bout you know i m picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching i m lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the can t be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i think ty ty john meneilly a bunch of people i didn t know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh i m killin y all niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so that s all the response he said man that was tight that was it you know i ain t get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at this time you know i didn t have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these a r s and they wanted beats from me so they d call me up i d play them some beats gimme a beat that sound like jay z you know they dick riders whatever so i ll play them these post blueprint beats or whatever and then i ll play my shit i ll be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i ain t have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didn t sign me you know what happened it was some a r s that fucked with me though but then like the heads it d be somebody at the company that ll say naw like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man i m not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up let s just say i didn t get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasn t even a nigga you know the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure it s not wack then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and dame was in the room so i played actually it s a song that you ll never hear but maybe i might use it so it s called wow i go to jacob with 25 thou you go with 25 hundred wow i got 11 plaques on my walls right now you got your first gold single damn nigga wow like the chorus went don t bite that chorus i might still use it so i play that song for him and he s like oh shit i ain t gonna front it s kinda hot like they still weren t looking at me like a rapper and i m sure dame figured like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and he s like yo man b b you don t want a brick you don t want a brick you gotta be under an umbrella you ll get rained on i told hip hop and hip hop was all oh word actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3h that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and i m a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know i m not gonna name no names but people told me oh he s just a producer rapper and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol and right the day i m talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said yo capitol pulled on the deal and you know i told them that roc a fella was interested and i don t know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with roc a fella so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you

album dookie dookie is neither of those things grounded in the ethos of antonin artauds famous quote where there is a stink of shit there is a smell of life dookie is a subtle indictment of kitsch art and marketing that chops and screws from a trap song into a hardcore metal song the five master terms of kenneth burkes pentad make many of the implied tacit notions within the text more accessible and easier to tease out and parse together of the master terms the agency stands out the most and foregrounds the text act on the surface dookie is free of a plot but a closer reading of the text reveals the plot in everything from the alarm sounds to the bass buildup and breakdown the song has only one full verse this terseness conveys a sense of urgency robert raimon roy says that he thanks his parents for this science experiment life and apologizes for embarrassing them when he uses vulgar inappropriate language like the term dookie the lack of detail leaves room for interpretation on the part of the listener or reader scene culturally dookie occupies a unique space in the hip hop canon its a song that was recorded two years ago but was only officially released last year one would expect it to be dated in a way that many other hip hop songs that have been out for two years are but dookie isnt dated making it harder to periodize moreover dookie as a disjointed nonlinear melding of hip hop and metal does not lend well to hegemonic framing christian hegelian or otherwise its lack of datedness can be attributed to the fact that the song isnt laden with references to a specific time place or thing it exists simply and thus the only scene to speak ofthe scene wherein rob talks about his philosophy about life being this foul thingis a very sparse scene agent dookie is the agent signifying the world and nature robert raimon roy raps my philosophy in this bitch i call it dookie and my religion just as stank think i call it dookie meaning dookie is ingrained fundamentally in the practices of daily life dookie is thus an ontological concept conveyed in a juvenile whomever smelt it dealt it way ontology is at the root of dookie for dookie concerns determining the necessity and fundamentality the be it should be noted that there is no mention of morality moral systems or idols in dookie dookie is life in the simplest of terms agency the agency of dookie is grounded in its sheer simplicity dookie stands in direct contradiction to marketing which is a complicated and concerted effort see dookie know whats dookie aint no hyperbole or kind of surgery to rearrange the surface even dookie doesnt display the common trappings or anatomy of a hip hop song nor does it utilize the same tropes and devices or pander to commercialism with consumer cues roy in that sense is not selling selling is a huge component of contemporary hip hop and a large part of how our culture narrativizes and creates structures of feeling hip hop music and popular music in general is inundated with messages about how we should feel about things values cachet and a host of assumptions are ascribed to otherwise insignificant things materials feelings fuel our consumer culture and whether were aware of it or not were told through relentless advertising how to feel about entire eras products and even peoples this is marketing the purpose of marketing is to elicit desired emotional responses to sell commodities to manipulate music does this alone and to add a secondary layer of manipulation is to complicate music and deceive the listener dookie doesnt complicate or deceive purpose dookie serves three main purposes to convey a philosophy and to subvert and critique the rap music industry its meaning is subtle and thus implied so it doesnt necessarily fail or succeed at this a close examination of the text leads one to believe that robert raimon roy is averse to pretty and polished verses hed much rather wax poetic in a vulgar way and be polarizing than to conform to conventions he is critiquing1","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

into the sky near me it seemed i felt it like a wall behind which i was sheltered from a wind and yet between the town and it i found when i walked forth at dawn to see new things were fields a river and beyond more fields the river at the time was fallen away and made a widespread brawl on cobble stones but the signs showed what it had done in spring good grass land gullied out and in the grass ridges of sand and driftwood stripped of bark i crossed the river and swung round the mountain and there i met a man who moved so slow with white faced oxen in a heavy cart it seemed no hand to stop him altogether what town is this i asked this lunenburg then i was wrong the town of my sojourn beyond the bridge was not that of the mountain but only felt at night its shadowy presence where is your village very far from here there is no villageonly scattered farms we were but sixty voters last election we cant in nature grow to many more that thing takes all the room he moved his goad the mountain stood there to be pointed at pasture ran up the side a little way and then there was a wall of trees with trunks after that only tops of trees and cliffs imperfectly concealed among the leaves a dry ravine emerged from under boughs into the pasture that looks like a path is that the way to reach the top from here not for this morning but some other time i must be getting back to breakfast now i dont advise your trying from this side there is no proper path but those that have been up i understand have climbed from ladds thats five miles back you cant mistake the place they logged it there last winter some way up id take you but im bound the other way youve never climbed it ive been on the sides deer hunting and trout fishing theres a brook that starts up on it somewhereive heard say right on the top tip topa curious thing but what would interest you about the brook its always cold in summer warm in winter one of the great sights going is to see it steam in winter like an oxs breath until the bushes all along its banks are inch deep with the frosty spines and bristles you know the kind then let the sun shine on it there ought to be a view around the world from such a mountainif it isnt wooded clear to the top i saw through leafy screens great granite terraces in sun and shadow shelves one could rest a knee on getting up with depths behind him sheer a hundred feet or turn and sit on and look out and down with little ferns in crevices at his elbow as to that i cant say but theres the spring right on the summit almost like a fountain that ought to be worth seeing if its there you never saw it i guess theres no doubt about its being there i never saw it it may not be right on the very top it wouldnt have to be a long way down to have some head of water from above and a good distance down might not be noticed by anyone whod come a long way up one time i asked a fellow climbing it to look and tell me later how it was what did he say he said there was a lake somewhere in ireland on a mountain top but a lakes different what about the spring he never got up high enough to see thats why i dont advise your trying this side he tried this side ive always meant to go and look myself but you know how it is it doesnt seem so much to climb a mountain youve worked around the foot of all your life what would i do go in my overalls with a big stick the same as when the cows havent come down to the bars at milking time or with a shotgun for a stray black bear twouldnt seem real to climb for climbing it i shouldnt climb it if i didnt want to not for the sake of climbing whats its name we call it hor i dont know if thats right can one walk around it would it be too far you can drive round and keep in lunenburg but its as much as ever you can do the boundary lines keep in so close to it hor is the township and the townships hor and a few houses sprinkled round the foot like boulders broken off the upper cliff rolled out a little farther than the rest warm in december cold in june you say i dont suppose the waters changed at all you and i know enough to know its warm compared with cold and cold compared with warm but all the funs in how you say a thing youve lived here all your life ever since hor was no bigger than a what i did not hear he drew the oxen toward him with light touches of his slim goad on nose and

was hand lettered then not like today where has the summer of 1572 gone brocade and sonnet marathons were the rage we used to dress up in the flags of rival baronies and conquer one another in cold rooms of stone out on the dance floor we were all doing the struggle while your sister practiced the daphne all alone in her room we borrowed the jargon of farriers for our slang these days language seems transparent a badly broken code the 1790s will never come again childhood was big people would take walks to the very tops of hills and write down what they saw in their journals without speaking our collars were high and our hats were extremely soft we would surprise each other with alphabets made of twigs it was a wonderful time to be alive or even dead i am very fond of the period between 1815 and 1821 europe trembled while we sat still for our portraits and i would love to return to 1901 if only for a moment time enough to wind up a music box and do a few dance steps or shoot me back to 1922 or 1941 or at least let me recapture the serenity of last month when we picked berries and glided through afternoons in a canoe even this morning would be an improvement over the present i was in the garden then surrounded by the hum of bees and the latin names of flowers watching the early light flash off the slanted windows of the greenhouse and silver the limbs on the rows of dark hemlocks as usual i was thinking about the moments of the past letting my memory rush over them like water rushing over the stones on the bottom of a stream i was even thinking a little about

the way she could play the violin it made it hard for people to believe that she was only ten but behind every brilliant mind there lies a monster this one just so happened to be her father see daddy was sick he d get a rush by playin touchy touch and tellin her to keep it hush it was his secret way of loving that he needed someone he could trust fucked her head up sayin if momma was alive she d be so proud of us so she d hide the desire to die but if you paid close attention you could see the sorrow in her eyes walking around in the only real hell no one would ever think she d have such a story to tell afraid to go home afraid to talk afraid of cryin she was too young to even know why and everyday she d go to the river with a message in a bottle sayin please god help me i don t wanna live to see tomorrow each day she d scrounge for a tiny shred of hope just to wish the bottle would stay afloat but every single solitary day the bottle seems to sink i don t know why but the bottle always sinks she never sees it happen but the bottle always sinks now only the bottom of the river knows what she really thinks she made that violin sing with so much pain you could almost hear her scream through the string s vibrations what was once sweet and innocent is now rotting cuz the psychotic father chose to probe the flowers of the pure and sacred her instrument was her only tongue to express the infinite abuse in its depths at night the footsteps crept to her door and she d begin to shake and weep and with tears rolling down her cheeks she s pretend she was asleep when the nightmare was over and the sun dawn is light she d retreat to the same place she always did rip a page from her diary and write with all her might then send it off into the current determined to find a way to live  being a victim of her daddy s hands for so long she lost the will to move on sick of picking up her violin to hide from what s wrong exhausted but staying strong she tried to play the bright side but couldn t bring herself to make nothing but sad songs sick of that sick feeling that stays in her stomach sick of waiting for a rescue by someone who found one of her bottles sick of being daddy s little secret she got up at the crack of day and smashed her violin into pieces then proceeded to walk towards the river with a plan only this time the diary and bottle was in her hand just walk with herself away from the hell not knowing at the river bottom lied all the cries for help it was weeks before they found her dead body some fisherman reeled it from the water like something from a detective novel diagnosis suicide stemmed from desperation cause near where she drowned they found about 500 messages in sunken bottles1","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

when i pass sometimes he lays there sleeping not even the milk trucks rolling by will startle him and other times he gets up and follows me along pawing at my leg and we walk until we get to calliope and he sees all the traffic and he stops and he s got a look on his face that says nope and i walk under the bridge and i give 20 dollar bills to the homeless and i go to the market pick up green cabbage and some pasta and maybe some bottled water then i come back to my room that i keep somewhere around there not far from st charles there s a girl i sometimes see walking down baronne or carondelet i wonder if she lives around there but i ve not had the courage or the stupidity to ask her yet which is better because my life s good and i don t need the hassle or the trouble gonna go back to my room lay down with my girl and watch the movie the boy in the plastic bubble and back in my room i can t find it or see it but somewhere around there there s a water fountain that runs all night and sometimes the sound of it drives me fucking crazy i swear and there s a mountain of tour dates piling up that i m really supposed to be paying mind but sometimes i don t feel like it so i pick up my guitar and put if off to another time sometimes at night i like to take walks through the path and the low hanging limbs at coliseum square there s a cafe i like on lower magazine and there s a guest house that used to be old infant asylum over there and a vietnamese restaurant i like and also the famous flying burrito and in the summer when i walk back through the park with short sleeve shirts i get eaten up by the mosquitoes and i come back and i watch channel 99 dedicated to cleaning up new orleans crime and i m gonna think about that old st vincent infant asylum on lower magazine a lot of the time and i turn on the news and there s always shootings at a school or the threat of wars somebody killed somebody s innocent people and now their gonna kill yours there s a place i walk past just a block away from carondelet friday nights boxing gym and sometimes me and my girlfriend we like to walk down there and gaze inside of it i watch their sloppy right hooks their awkward footwork and their clumsy lead lefts they re just getting started buy hey i gotta say i ve always been envious of athletes discipline and their work ethic i used to wrestle from when i was a kid for a bit but i wasn t very good and i quit one day when i got pinned but i clowned around on a movie set later with noah taylor in almost famous and we were sparring and i caught him right smack dab on the chin that motherfucker can act and if you haven t seen him watch vanilla sky or flirting or max he played a young hitler trying to sell his paintings to an art dealer played by john cusack noah chain smoked marlboro reds and he had announced stillwater and yelled into the mic so loud that his throat bled we all got habits and i like chasing extras around the set and bringing them back to my trailer bed there s a lot of down time on a movie set and you gotta kill it one way or the other we go hang around venice beach or tijuana or north hollywood me and noah we got along like brothers we used to walk around the santa monica pier and eat seafood and smoke cigarettes with our girlfriends emily and jeannine and when i think about those summer days i get a little choked up cause i was 32 and in my prime then noah was the closest friend on a movie set that i ve ever had i hope to see him one day again but if i don t i m just happy to have passed through this life and for a time to have befriended him  the last time i saw him i played scala in london and we walked around hyde park 2004 but i m sad to say that since then i don t hear from him or his lady friend much anymore i heard he had a part in hbo s game of thrones he s a bad ass actor a secret weapon in any cast and any good movie director out there really oughta fucking know oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man oh man where does the time go i m feeling down all the sudden and i don t know why and i m running out of words so i m gonna send my engineer home gonna go home today lay down in my bed keep up on this bad news baltimore news story then i ll watch the charlie sheen roast for some laughs or maybe the one with bob saget because they re both so fucking funny bob took a lot of shit but in the end you gotta admit he had the best bit when he said all you stupid motherfuckers suck my hundred million dollar dick and charlie sheen i love the way he doesn t give a shit and sits there grinning and how they won t let him off about when he said i m fucking winning there s a little black cat that i see sitting on the corner of erato and carondelet i see him sitting on a patch of grass when i come home from rouses market he s got a cute little patch of white on his little black chest funny how nothing bothers him not even the passers by or the noisy milk trucks that roll

come to pass 2 nephi 28 2 and the things which shall be written out of the book shall be of great worth unto the children of men and especially unto our seed which is a remnant of the house of israel 2 nephi 28 3 for it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which are built up and not unto the lord when the one shall say unto the other behold i i am the lord s and the others shall say i i am the lord s and thus shall every one say that hath built up churches and not unto the lord 2 nephi 28 4 and they shall contend one with another and their priests shall contend one with another and they shall teach with their learning and deny the holy ghost which giveth utterance 2 nephi 28 5 and they deny the power of god the holy one of israel and they say unto the people hearken unto us and hear ye our precept for behold there is no god today for the lord and the redeemer hath done his work and he hath given his power unto men 2 nephi 28 6 behold hearken ye unto my precept if they shall say there is a miracle wrought by the hand of the lord believe it not for this day he is not a god of miracles he hath done his work 2 nephi 28 7 yea and there shall be many which shall say eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die and it shall be well with us 2 nephi 28 8 and there shall also be many which shall say eat drink and be merry nevertheless fear godhe will justify in committing a little sin yea lie a little take the advantage of one because of his words dig a pit for thy neighbor there is no harm in this and do all these things for tomorrow we die and if it so be that we are guilty god will beat us with a few stripes and at last we shall be saved in the kingdom of god 2 nephi 28 9 yea and there shall be many which shall teach after this manner false and vain and foolish doctrines and shall be puffed up in their hearts and shall seek deep to hide their counsels from the lord and their works shall be in the dark 2 nephi 28 10 and the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against them 2 nephi 28 11 yea they have all gone out of the way they have become corrupted 2 nephi 28 12 because of pride and because of false teachers and false doctrine their churches have become corrupted and their churches are lifted up because of pride they are puffed up 2 nephi 28 13 they rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries they rob the poor because of their fine clothing and they persecute the meek and the poor in heart because in their pride they are puffed up 2 nephi 28 14 they wear stiff necks and high heads yea and because of pride and wickedness and abominations and whoredoms they have all gone astray save it be a few who are the humble followers of christ nevertheless they are led that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men 2 nephi 28 15 o the wise and the learned and the rich that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts and all those who preach false doctrines and all those who commit whoredoms and pervert the right way of the lord wo wo wo be unto them saith the lord god almighty for they shall be thrust down to hell 2 nephi 28 16 wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught and revile against that which is good and say that is of no worth for the day shall come that the lord god will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish 2 nephi 28 17 but behold if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed saith the lord of hosts 2 nephi 28 18 but behold that great and abominable church the whore of all the earth must tumble to the earth and great must be the fall thereof 2 nephi 28 19 for the kingdom of the devil must shake and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains and they be stirred up to anger and perish 2 nephi 28 20 for behold at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men and stir them up to anger against that which is good 2 nephi 28 21 and others will he pacify and lull them away into carnal security that they will say all is well in zion yea zion prospereth all is welland thus the devil cheateth their souls and leadeth them away carefully down to hell 2 nephi 28 22 and behold others he flattereth away and telleth them there is no hell and he saith unto them i am no devil for there is noneand thus he whispereth in their ears until he grasps them with his awful chains from whence there is no deliverance 2 nephi 28 23 yea they are grasped with death and hell and death and hell and the devil and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of god and be judged according to their works from whence they must go into the place prepared for them even a lake of fire and brimstone which is endless torment 2 nephi 28 24 therefore wo be unto him that is at ease in zion 2 nephi 28 25 wo be unto him that crieth all is well 2 nephi 28 26 yea wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men and denieth the power of god and the gift of the holy ghost 2 nephi 28 27 yea wo be unto him that

gladness and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall 2 nephi 28 29 wo be unto him that shall say we have received the word of god and we need no more of the word of god for we have enough 2 nephi 28 30 for behold thus saith the lord god i will give unto the children of men line upon line precept upon precept here a little and there a little and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts and lend an ear unto my counsel for they shall learn wisdom for unto him that receiveth i will give more and from them that shall say we have enough from them shall be taken away even that which they have 2 nephi 28 31 cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm or shall hearken unto the precepts of men save their precepts shall be given by the power of the holy ghost 2 nephi 28 32 wo be unto the gentiles saith the lord god of hosts for notwithstanding i shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day they will deny me nevertheless i
