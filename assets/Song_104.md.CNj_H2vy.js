my mistakes but they take years away and all my nights were yesterdays till i met you joyride for the bloodlines like you did when your romance was sprayed up on the motorway bridge you left home with a warning the kid that never came down but you see more of the mornings than the wide suburban skies of your hometown there is nowhere i would rather be than over you theres no place that i could ever be get through to you going somewhere ive seen in my dreams its falling away when i need you the time keeps running away and this is one for every old friend that ive lost every girl i loved at school who got married to a ghost and the absent sons and daughters who were waylaid on the road with levonelle and the tears that fell cos youre scared of getting old you are the opposite fucking thing of a good reason to weep youre the future of a place youve only been to in your sleep youre the church bells in the morning when youve woken up cold on the sofas you surrender to when youve been out being bold you are the 5am exodus youre the have you got a light youre every new friendship that dies quickly in a fight you are the prodigal son hid in a phonebox from the rain youre in the shower mondays whispering never again you are the one with eyes that look like kids lost down wells youre the last known secret the friend that never tells you are the straight through crew not the time out crowd i

confused young juvenile king of the project blues so i choose to take a piece of the action but my sober state of mind won t let it happen the 24 7 is the number one stresser dealin with the peer pressure most don t understand how it is in the world of today growin up as a young black teen i used to dream of bein a architect easier said than done believe me it s hard to get outta the projects without forgettin where you came from my parents told me from day one finish school and avoid all obstacles but my environment makes it so impossible for instance build a strong social life without messin up still tryin to live right like in junior high i used to wonder why certain females went out with certain guys then one day it all dawned on me yo you gotta be down and have it goin on see i wasn t down with the mainstream or should i say their team ha now i m gettin steamed gotta find a way to get accepted by my peers so now i m sippin on beers buyin new gear nuthin but the best forget levi s strictly polo and guess but how would i make the cash it gotta be easy and it gotta be fast thinkin to myself does that make me lesser just dealin with the peer pressure  around my way there s a kid that most don t understand how he lives is it negative or positive he has a grade a average but when he s on the streets with his friends he s a savage a freshman of high school daily attendant he never got in trouble never did he get suspended good little kenny who would believe he dropped out of school and started to smoke weed i saw the signs but i didn t pay attention because he got offended every time that i would mention the drinkin the smokin the low school grades and sleepin in class laid back with his black shades nowadays you catch kenny hangin in the hallways with his crew findin more ways to break outta school and hit the block and get buckwild stay out of the way of a mad child cause he s a product of hell kenny never fell but he s gonna fall overall so let s take a trip to the ghetto where kenny got drunk and bought a burner off his man so he pulled the trigger and the suicide note read i m glad it s finally over and i m finally dead and no more do i have to

but ain t that just life shes been pregnant now for some time it took us years and enough tries i thought it wouldnt happen from my young life from the drunk times or when i tried drugs twice i thought downstairs had gone and messed it up right the doctor told me that i need to stop stressin the only thing thats workin against us is just time that was true two months by my wife called me up while i was workin at the pub right she told me i was gonna be a daddy we both broke down she said theres somethin that i d done right i called my mother told her i was gonna be a father mum cried so did i i was tongue tied i can t explain this feelin but i love life ive never had a purpose and this had just become mine to create this little person thats fun size a little bit of her and a little bit of me but i pray he gets his mums eyes i say he cause ive always wanted a son right the ultrasound said it s a boy my little ray of sunshine it dawned on me i cant wait to see my son rise you know what they say about time though it does fly fast forward nine months and suddenly its crunch time it s been a few days of goin through contractions gotta stopwatch timin every moment that it happens we reached five minutes so its hospital time i call ahead to see the doctors arrive my wifes laughin now i properly drive like the cops are behind but there was barely any traffic so we got there in time im a little scared but she aint got a worry in sight shes a warrior exactly what you want in a wife its been several days of epic pain every day she wakes up finally she s comin to that second stage of labour i sit next to her squeeze on her hand put a sponge up on her head and say breathe if you can i love you so much baby youre so strong i could never do this but you so easily can she said the pain is insane like her abdomens ruptured like someones got a knife and they stabbin her stomach shes like we have to do somethin the nurse said its natural relax it s just a sign that its actually comin shes like no its too much its too hard to get out im sayin any words i thinkll help at calmin her down doctors like youre nearly through the worst part of it now take a look and see my little king is startin to crown they all tellin her to push and shes screamin shes sayin that it hurts i tell her to keep breathin its like push is the only word that theyve said now then im shocked by the massive scream she lets out the doctors like yes now the heads out and then i watch as he quickly pullin the rest out its so amazin to see my son in the flesh i cant help but notice he hasn t taken a breath now they put a little plastic thing in his mouth while the doctors two fingers are slightly pumpin his chest down i start panickin somethings gone wrong they push me to the side i can barely see whats goin on hes not breathin they need to resuscitate him hes suffocatin i see that its somethin major i feel so helpless i wish i could come and save him i pray that my sonll make it its takin em fuckin ages everyones in shock im just listenin in holdin my breath wishin i could give it to him fuck at twenty minutes now theyre stoppin they turn around they say weve lost him im in shock i cant talk im starin at the ground i cant walk they hand him to us cant believe the size of him the most beautiful thing ive ever seen but theres no life in him my wifes cryin like why arent they revivin him i said they tried for twenty minutes shes like try again now im feelin like im stuck in hell this is the worst pain ive fuckin felt ive been ten years clean but now im drunk and on the drugs as well im doin anything to numb myself but nothin helps i believed in god for that i feel dumb as hell can someone please tell god to go and fuck himself im sorry yo its hard to be faithful it

gave its blaze to my heart now brings a haze be careful cause i m an axe victim hung up on these silver strings like wings like time machines like voices on the winds we hit the road to home sad amps and smashed guitars played badly at the duke to almost no applause but someone made it worthwhile when smiling with bright eyes they gave me full attention and took me by surprise today the feeling s gone it faded like a ghost last night i saw the future this morning there s no hope and the words that i sung so clear are now clouded by my tears please be careful cause i m an axe victim hung up on these silver strings like sails like seagull s cries like churchbells in the night","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

the opiate of the people third strike im so gone hold on waist deep in the river with all my clothes on and i aint sayin theres no god just sayin it takes more than religion to know god no tears my face is a sand storm and ive had a crash course in that force all we ask for is justice ive seen him fleein the scene one set of footprints runnin so keep your faith ill keep on breathin i will always have something to believe in after everything ive seen its hard to see coincidence i dont know whos listenin i wanna stay away from the fire id talk to the lord but im scared that hes wearin a wire lets conquer the space between the molotov cocktail flame and the stone faced revolutionary with the bad aim the landscape is bleedin my palms are stained red find another universe to leave for dead leaves are soakin in the wine but it tastes alright have another sip itll help to chase the nightmares are scared of the dark in these parts so dance in the moonlight hide from the morning star born in the forks of the tongues of the sins of the innocent twins one is wearin a cloak and a cloven hoof the other is livin proof that pretty things can have sinister wings too so walk like a predator rememberin the steps of his last meal pop the champagne waste what you cant spill pinch your skin if you feel it then you know its real leave it in the dream where the steam rises off her still for every action you know the rest so consider this a warning consider this mourning in america the proletariat is still snoring street corners mirror the faces lines forming once upon a time there was a story went to sleep at eighteen and woke up when he was forty no savings and hes not insured but he helped a corporation make a few cents more and as a young man he helped a nation fight and win a war but hes getting more and more convinced it was a sin so he sits quietly in the revival wondering if god is the revolver hidden in the bible in the middle of a crisis he is living life like a missile in a silo rusted and dusty but still capable of devouring a country hungry people dont stay hungry they either die or they take a bite and one day hes gonna crack open and bleed sunshine through the fading night one day they will take his life  maybe not through death but a simple push a soft breaking he will be lying in bed or waiting to get on a bus and his hands will roll up like starving spiders his lips will form a word maybe a name and he will push back we are all closer we are all capable we all have so much tumbling around inside of us pushing against our skin kicking at the weak

arms complete and udder bullshit yeah i took my shirt off on the flier but your picture was awkward too he s like yeah i love standing next to a topless dude and you re not a voltron gangster you re like voltron klingon i your shirt is like i took your shirt i fisted it like yeah i m a skinny guy probably not in the best shape but you should do like my metabolism and drop some dead weight and i ve been trying to battle them both but they re too chicken ducking me like i m unknown so now i get to kill two birds with one stone so if you thought you had some fame you re only tripping off his star dust not a dollar to your name now even just a couple starbucks and just cause you re a nebula you think that you re a star but this nebula could punch me and i still wouldn t be star struck and how are you the worst but claim you re top in all the city they gave you hfk and f l o who you robbed along with tricky and now you get a title shot that s awfully fucking fishy cause you sucking off the president like monica lewinsky and you aren t a real rapper you ain t even got the basics jeff created you without him you would not have made it see when i flow i got him thinking this my occupation watch a real artist kill a sketch that g o d created and i hate nebula more than anyone will ever know so much that i ma travel back in time to when they settled rome formula the best approach and come up with a clever hoax to make sure no astronomers will ever build a telescope and your girlfriends have a secret that ll probably seem tragic let s just say i wasn t hungry but we made a cheese sandwich and we took a trip to oakland with this douche and as far as the battles go we should ve called it the sketch loves california rapper s show telling everyone i m a big fan of your rappity rapper flow the way you were dick riding the west your name should be amber rose you got a real dumb name passion fruit you bout to go to go down easy apple juice i ll send you off in a box cans of food you re not fat but you re chunky campbell soup see me and chedda go together like motion sensors at smoke detectors snowy weather in cold decembers goal defenders and open netters souls and treasures bones and scepters jokes and jesters bones and feathers snow and leopards chrome and leathers poet shows with no attenders now we were gonna talk about how his people have some of the littlest dicks let the cat out the bag on some stereotypical shit y all know what ubiquitous did try and get you karate style with a swift upper kick nah but when i mentioned the word cat he just started licking his lips so if you want to arrive alive don t ask this guy to drive see he s actually got tiny eyes but thanks to his heritage shit this guy s bitter when he goes shopping for glasses he ll even get them a size thicker just so it ll make his eye s bigger he even thinks he could be a famous rapper but it ll never happen in this lifetime it crushed his dreams of asians in the main stream when he found out yelawolf was a white guy see i kicked it with these guys once and it got bad i won t lie i pulled out a joint while we kicked back and wrote rhymes i offered a joint to ubiquitous he started saying no waving his hands to both sides with his shirt over his mouth like that s gross guys i was like man are you hopeless so i tried passing it to chedda he was like how do i hold it just pretend like you re handling your partner s little dangling scrotum see you guys are just a couple of fun sponges that never did anything in their past to mention i bet back in school you both attended every class and never had detention well i m about to put the class in session you got no street smarts and you lack direction their only bad intentions are the little half erections they get from stamp collections and we ain t friends anymore bud i fucking hate ubiquitous if i saw a dog attacking you i wouldn t give a shit but while the thing was biting you and ripping you to bits i d just think to myself damn karma really is a bitch and when you battled lexington you were getting fat and out of shape with a gut because of your weight you hated yourself it was blatant as fuck but since then you must ve been working out dropping pounds like every day of the month but if he was fat and chinese i guess that would ve made him a chunk and chedda when you rap it leaves us feeling awkward and uneasy you ll be all like i m ripping this pitiful kid with syllables all the people will believe me but when i start rapping like this you know that i sound like i m nothing but weezy he thinks he s the big cheese but you need to stop you re beneath me i ll hit him with a bit of the rhythm and put him in a box and say cheesy see you going up against us was the worst choice in the world you re like bart simpson just a little boy with the voice of a girl hey asshole you talk shit about the asians that don t bother me neither cause to the female i m the chinese justin bieber you girlfriend take one look at my dick and she went along either hey it sa not my fault your girl caught the yellow fever yo and you calling me a little boy i saw that coming from a mile away no i m not a little boy but beating you is child s play and yes i lost weight cause i ve been working out a lot so don t make me do you like i did my belt and take you down a notch and no we don t smoke any weed but even though we ve been afraid to we still rolled up in this joint with some blunt raps and blazed you sketch you base your entire life around these battle raps and rhyme schemes like this one time when you came across a homicidal crime scene when everyone else was gone sketch stuck around and lolligagged made sure nobody could hear him then he yelled out body bag another time his girlfriend started choking on her dinner but meanwhile instead of performing the heimlich he just screamed out freestyle and neb s got a cranium like rihanna yeah exactly that s what i said he wanted a high five so i slapped him in his five head and your crew s name is the poets yes it is stupid they re vets but i have never been impressed by their music in retrospect you better check for neb s execution cause i put an end to poets like the french revolution so you won a couple battles but you ll still never drop an astounding verse yet you think you re at the top cause you re clueless to how it works big headed and egotistical acting so proud it hurts nebula is a fitting name cause you never been down to earth and when nebula doesn t get his milky way he stars to get blue if it s any constellation the universe doesn t revolve around you you can t tell that you re out of place your head is in outer space a pansy poet popping pills with a permanent pouty face without outlining your fate your whole future just got erased that s how you make an entire sketch vanish without a trace see your name means to be everywhere at once and you re teaming up with chedda cheese on some raping little infants shit so you could say that the pedophile problem in north america could simply be labeled as ubiquitous see you were off to the school yard wearing a smile all laughing and waving secretly waited for the perfect chance to snatch him up wrap him up and rape him but then you spot chedda cheese grab him throw him in the back of your van and tape him but then he panics and peels off and then he crashed cause he s asian see chedda you wanna be a dope act like math dose and solomon but you can t bro you crack jokes got no fans hoes or following no backbone you re flat broke and your rap flows need polishing chedda cheese you make me fucking sick lactose intolerant and you re so white and pale you look unhealthy and need sunshine you re so skinny i bet you hate food and get grumpy when it s lunchtime you smell funky like a muff dive you re ugly and you re tongue tied and with acne like that your face is more bumpy than a bus ride see paul here is in medical school and he gets harassed by his estranged father he yells and tells him to train harder so for paul hung and shea rogers well they don t need an excuse to get naked and play doctor but fuck you and chedda s games of doctor patient you re not qualified for shit you need a change of occupation so i ll pull out the scalpel and put the blade to this cocky asian and start pulling out your insides like i was playing a game of operation but wait what the fuck does chedda do for a living well remember he s the dj at the strip club so he should be a player know how to get the ladies naked and break rappers like snoop dogg or too hort would be people he d take after but he does none of those things he doesn t get brain laid or date dancers i know i asked him if he was gay and he wouldn t even give me a straight answer see you two kids are just a couple of fans of me you don t know what it s like to have a bitch on her hands and knees you probably never brought a broad back to your bachelor suite smashed it and had her scream you ve never had a shorty s ass to squeeze let alone get past her jeans you live at home with your parents chedda there ain t no mac in cheese and you re the lamest dude i ever met i knew it from the second that you stepped into the cipher always acting like you re on a level higher just cause you ve never drinked and high and you re never medicated either so he s the sober guy that s asian so we d even hesitate to be our designated driver but thanks to chedda s face shit this guy is never bored he s into some kind of tai chi fetish porn so to ubiquitous your face is one giant metaphor for a chinese checker board and you may have some swagger to ya but behind the rhythm your shit is simple this little bitch looks sick and brittle and with a face like that he really puts the pimp in pimple yeah we live with our parents so what i don t care that it bugs you it s apparent you re just jealous cause your parents don t love you and yeah i m becoming a doctor cause that s where all the cash is at so let me drop some knowledge in the context of a battle rap your sister let me film her bending backwards like an acrobat until we made the lens fog up like a cataract and you can make fun of my job but i don t care to intervene cause if it wasn t for strippers you would ve never met mary and kristine we re fighting after this now we might be some back packer wack backwards ass crackers but compared to you we sound like a couple of smack rappers so we bout to the let the lead pop knock you out your dress socks check cock get dropped red dot head shot they re a couple of bass heads i had these two mistaken for ravers you could say that their brains are recuperating from failure type of stoners who just love hallucinating on vapors like duuuude i m communicating with nature the type of paranoid hippies who would come up with conspicuous plans and say the government is listening man wow you got some creepy ass facial hair that you think is un achievable like uh my perm stash is so unbelievable and these two are so low on cash it s a crisis drop a loony and watch them hov around the dollar like gas station prices but me i m tighter than emo jeans on cee lo green you looking at both of us wondering how we can be so mean you never gon reach those speeds cause you rap at a sluggish pace if you were a word document you would be double spaced yes your rap is lethargic and all your tracks have been garbage so although your name is sketch you re not an actual artist you live under a rock you re slightly fat and retarded and you talk like this you re patrick the starfish and when it comes to spongebob references it s easy to see we got em cause your girlfriend s the one with krusty krabs in her bikini bottom so step and you ll get wrecked i said it and yes sketch is known for referencing his city to get some respect yet to instead rep the american flag is your best bet cause you re really a white trash blue collar red neck and you know that we re bringing the chemistry every line building a legacy together and shine but it be permanent winning the tournament is really a matter of

point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequod s carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage like all sea going ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain off handed practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary duties repairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsy bladed oars inserting bull s eyes in the deck or new tree nails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vice bench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the try works a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his ever ready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost land bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of right whale bone and cross beams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagoda looking cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark bone ear rings the carpenter drills his ears another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but top blocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this half horrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an all ramifying heartlessness yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah s ark was it that this old carpenter had been a life long wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a new born babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screw drivers cork screws tweezers awls pens rulers nail filers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screw driver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were yet as previously hinted this omnitooled open and shut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning life principle in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentry box and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

hes supposed 2 years go by and all is well its been seven whole years since he was in jail fuckin around with niggas thinking he was cool he was 18 about to graduate from school thinking he knew better than what his parents said next thing he knew he laid on a penitentiary bed he wanted to find a way out but then he got in contact with a nigga to bail him out as long as he moved weight and never complained as long as he killed niggas and never felt shame he never realized the life he lived was full of sin and that he would never win it never hit him til he had a child of his own it takes seven whole years for him to be grown while he reminisces on life he hears a hard knock on the door paranoid he grabs the glock to his surprise nobody would wake up even though it was loud as fuck in the mornin he thinks its the reaper so he wont answer until someone kicked in the door and then started blastin an unfinished birthday cake in the kitchen while he laid on the floor and started wishing that he had more time to live but it was too late he got killed by a nigga who wanted revenge now the son that he loved would be a bastard had only hed known a pastor to save him from the life he lived welcome to the stories of the unfortunate at seven years old the only thing he ever knew was living in a foster home with a 5 year old sister by his side he always had a reason to survive he had to make sure that he was always there to make sure that his sister was never scared in any type of weather any type of environment the warmth and shelter he had to provide it fast forward ten years later he was making choices he shouldn t have made up until 3 am ridin around town cause he was hanging around the wrong crowd sooner or later he started to gang bang and lookin for other niggas who was doing the same thing until one night one of his homies hit him up talkin about he found some hoes who down to fuck so he said alright ill be there in a minute took a stroll down the road and then what he expected was not what he saw two lookin hard ass niggas as they see him in his car at a red light paranoid as hell he steps on the gas and turns right calls up his homie no answer so he calls it a night except he sees seven missed calls straight from his sister he rushes home and takes out his pistol she laid flat on the floor dead bruised up body and marks on her head it finally sinked in he was not even supposed to be alive but heres the twist yes it was a set up but had he stayed home and protected his sister they wouldve both died his friend was looking out for him  she wakes up from a loud sound she cannot find her man she looks around her sons fast asleep and does not awake she goes down to check on his birthday cake her boyfriend collapses she doesn t know what to do she fucking panics by this time her son starts to wake up crying she goes to his aid and takes the pacifier puts it in his mouth he closes his eyes and passes out today marks the day of two years living on earth and they have to put his father in the dirt whats even more tragic than that in two months she would have a daughter without a dad she thinking what the hell is she supposed to do now that she lost her man to a 22 she hears him callin she calls back to him and shes bawlin tears running down they face and he hates himself for not living in better ways a few moments go by and he dies a year goes by with her daughter and son with no family in sight shes the only one to ever care for em until she runs out of finances to pay for em she sends them off to a
