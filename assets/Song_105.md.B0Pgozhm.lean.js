the wall states no shoes allowed some wannabe beboppers do the twist in their socks or barefeet the picture windows don t look out the street but instead b w movies of 50 s street scenes play behind

costumes vincent and mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 59 edsel buddy holly comes over sporting a big button on his chest that says hi i m buddy pleasing you please me buddy hi i m buddy

neal from that show baton rouge she was the leader a japanese one a black one a french one and a brunette one me we all had special skills sommerset had a photographic memory the japanese fox was a kung fu master the black girl was a demolition expert the french fox specialty was sex vincent what was your specialty mia knives the character i played raven mccoy her background was she was raised by circus performers so she grew up doing a knife act according to the show she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife but because she grew up in a circus she was also something of an acrobat she could do illusions she was a trapeze artist when you re keeping the world safe from evil you never know when being a trapeze artist s gonna come in handy and she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather an old vaudevillian taught her if we woulda got picked up they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode i woulda told and ol joke vincent do you remember any of the jokes mia

something like that i have no idea what you re gonna ask you could ask me what you re gonna ask me and my natural response could be to be offended then through no fault of my own i woulda broken my promise vincent then let s just forget it mia that is an impossibility trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility vincent is that a fact mia nods her head yes mia besides it s more exciting when you don t have permission vincent what do you think about what happened to antwan mia who s antwan vincent tony rocky horror mia he fell out of a window vincent that s one way to say it another way is he was thrown out another was is he was thrown out by marsellus and even another way is he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you mia is that a fact

heard marsellus threw rocky horror out of a four story window because he massaged my feet vincent yeah mia and you believed that vincent at the time i was told it seemed reasonable mia marsellus throwing tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable vincent no it seemed excessive but that doesn t mean it didn t happen i heard marsellus is very protective of you mia a husband being protective of his wife is one thing a husband almost killing another man for touching his wife s feet is something else vincent but did it happen mia the only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it i met anwan once at my wedding then never again the truth is nobody knows why marsellus tossed tony rocky horror out of that window except marsellus and

in the alcove vincent i m gonna take a piss mia that was a little bit more information than i needed to know but go right ahead vincent shuffles off to the john mia moves to her cd player thumbs through a stack of cds and selects one k d lang the speakers blast out a high energy country number which mia plays air guitar to she dances her way around the room and finds herself by vincent s overcoat hanging on the rack she touches its sleeve it feels good her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch like a little girl playing cowboy she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper imitating what he did earlier licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette maybe a little too fat but not bad for a first try mia thinks so anyway her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his zippo lighter she slaps the lighter against her leg trying to light it fancy style like vince did what do you know she did it mia s one happy clam she triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke lighting it up then loudly snaps the zippo closed the mia made cigarette is brought up to her lips and she takes a long cool drag her hand slides the zippo back in the

nose something is terribly wrong then the rush hits bathroom vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror vincent it s a moral test of yourself whether or not you can maintain loyalty because when people are loyal to each other that s very meaningful living room mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom but it s like she s trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees blood begins to drip from mia s nose then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits bathroom vince continues vincent so you re gonna go out there drink your drink say

side of that door so he goes through it living room we follow behind vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room where he finds mia lying on the floor like a rag doll she s twisted on her back blood and puke are down her front and her face is contorted not out of the tightness of pain but just the opposite the muscles in her face are so relaxed she lies still with her mouth wide open slack jawed vincent oh jesus christ jesus fuckin christ oh fuck me vincent moves like greased lightning to mia s fallen body bending down where she lays he puts his fingers on her neck to check her pulse she slightly stirs mia is aware of vincent over her speaking to her vincent mia mia what the hell happened but she s unable to communicate mia makes a few lost mumbles but they re not distinctive enough to be called words vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story vincent i ll be a son of a bitch mia mia what did you take answer me honey what did you take mia is incapable of answering he slaps her face hard vincent springs up and runs to his overcoat hanging on the rack he goes through the pockets frantically it s gone vincent makes a beeline to mia we follow vincent okay

got somethin for ya the captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket capt koons this watch i got here was first purchased by your great granddaddy it was bought during the first world war in a little general store in knoxville tennessee it was bought by private doughboy ernie coolidge the day he set sail for paris it was your great granddaddy s war watch made by the first company to ever make wrist watches you see up until then people just carried pocket watches your great granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war then when he had done his duty he went home to your great grandmother took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol coffee can and in that can it stayed til your grandfather dane coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the germans once again this time they called it world war two your great granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck unfortunately dane s luck wasn t as good as his old man s your granddad was a marine and he was killed with all the other marines at the battle of wake island your granddad was facing death and he knew it none of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin that island alive so three days before the japanese took the island your 22 year old grandfather asked a gunner on an air force transport named winocki a man he had never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son who he had never seen in the flesh his gold watch three days later your grandfather was dead but winocki kept his word after the war was over he paid a visit to your grandmother delivering to your infant father his dad s gold watch this watch this watch was on your daddy s wrist when he was shot down over hanoi he was captured and put in a vietnamese prison camp now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it d be confiscated the way your daddy looked at it that watch was your birthright and he d be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy s birthright so he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin his ass five long years he wore this watch up his ass then when he died of dysentery he gave me the watch i hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up

corner day butch isn t completely reckless he has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin through the front door ext alley day butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street then he discreetly glances out ext street butch s apartment day everything seems normal more or less the right number of cars in the street none of the parked cars appear out of place none of them have a couple of goons sitting inside basically it looks like normal morning activity in front of butch s home butch peers around a wall taking in the vital information butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything he crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard across the street from butch s building on the corner is a combination donut shop and japanese restaurant a big sign sticks up in the air with the name teriyaki donut and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice ext butch s apartment courtyard day butch is in the courtyard of his north hollywood apartment building once again everything appears normal the laundry room the pool his apartment door nothing appears disturbed butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment number 12 he steps outside the door and listens inside nothing butch slowly inserts the key into the door quietly opening it int butch s apartment day his apartment hasn t been touched he cautiously steps inside shuts the door and takes a quick look around obviously no one is there butch walks into his modest kitchen and opens the refrigerator he takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it with carton in hard butch surveys the apartment then he goes to the bedroom his bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat clean and anonymous the only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies an olympic silver medal a framed issue of ring magazine with butch on the cover and a poster of jerry quarry and one of george chuvalo sure enough there s the watch just like he said it was on the bedside table hanging on his little kangaroo statue he walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen he opens a cupboard and takes out a box of pop tarts putting down the milk he opens the box takes out two pop tarts and puts them in the toaster butch glances to his right his eyes fall on something what he sees is a small compact czech m61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it lying on his kitchen counter butch holy shit he picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it then a toilet flushes butch looks up to the bathroom door which is parallel to the kitchen there is someone behind it like a rabbit caught in a radish patch butch freezes not knowing what to do the bathroom door opens and vincent vega steps out of the bathroom tightening his belt in his hand is the book modesty blaise by peter o donnell vincent and butch lock eyes vincent freezes butch doesn t move except to point the m61 in vincent s direction neither man opens his mouth then the toaster loudly kicks up the pop tarts that s all the situation needed butch s finger hits the trigger muffled fire shoots out of the end of the gun vincent is seemingly wracked with twenty bullets simultaneously lifting him off his feet propelling him through the air and crashing through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom by the time butch removes his finger from the trigger vincent is annihilated butch stands frozen amazed at what just happened his look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once vincent down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip with the respect it deserves butch carefully places the m61 back on the kitchen counter then he exits the apartment quickly ext apartment courtyard day butch not running but walking very rapidly crosses the courtyard comes out of the apartment building crosses the street goes through the alley and into his car in one steadicam shot ext honda day butch cranks the car into gear and drives away the big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face ext apartment building street day the honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building int honda day butch looks out the window at his former home butch that s how you re gonna beat em butch they keep underestimatin ya this makes the boxer laugh out loud as he laughs he flips a tape in the cassette player when the music starts he sings along with it he drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on the corner across from teriyaki donut butch is still chuckling singing along with the song as we see through the windshield the big man himself marsellus wallace exit teriyaki donut carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee he steps off the curb crossing the street in front of butch s car this is the first time we see marsellus clearly laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him when marsellus is in front of butch s car he casually glances to his left sees butch continues walking then stops double take am i really seeing what i m seeing butch doesn t wait for the big man to answer his own question he stomps on the gas pedal the little honda slams into marsellus sending him the donuts and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad sided by a gold camaro z 28 breaking all the windows in the honda and sending it up on the sidewalk butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was fabienne s honda blood flows from his nostrils the still functional tape player continues to play a pedestrian pokes his head inside pedestrian jesus are you okay butch look at him spaced out butch i guess marsellus wallace lies sprawled out in the street gawkers gather around the body gawker 1 he s dead he s dead this jerk s yelling makes marsellus come to two pedestrians help the shaken butch out of the wreckage the woozy marsellus gets to his feet gawker 2 if you need a witness in court i ll be glad to help he was a drunken maniac he hit you and crashed into that car marsellus who gawker 2 him marsellus follows the gawker s finger and sees butch coolidge down the street looking a shambles marsellus well i ll be damned the big man takes out a 45 automatic and the gawkers back away marsellus starts moving toward butch butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee line toward him butch sacre bleu marsellus brings up his weapon and fires but he s so hurt shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild he hits a looky loo woman in the hip she falls to the ground screaming looky loo woman oh my god i ve been shot that s all butch needs to see he s outta here marsellus runs after him the crowd looks agape butch is in a mad limping run the big man s hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads mason dixie pawnshop int mason dixie pawnshop day maynard a hillbilly lookin boy stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when all of a sudden chaos in the form of butch races into his world maynard can i help you wit somethin butch shut up butch quickly takes measure of the situation than stands next to the door maynard now you just wait one goddamn minute before maynard can finish his threat marsellus charges in he doesn t get past the doorway because butch lands his fist in marsellus face the gangster s feet go out from under him and the big man falls flat on his back outside two police cars with their sirens blaring race by butch pounces on the fallen body punching him twice more in the face butch takes the gun out of marsellus hand than grabs ahold of his middle finger butch so you like chasing people huh he breaks the finger marsellus lets out a pain sound butch then places the barrel of the 45 between his eyes pulls back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter butch well guess what big man you caught me maynard hold it right there godammit butch and marsellus look up at maynard who s brandishing a pumpaction shotgun aimed at the two men butch look mister this ain t any of your business maynard i m makin it my business now

with the butt of the shotgun knocking butch down and out after butch goes down maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone marsellus wallace from his position on the floor groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number maynard waits on the line while the other end rings then it picks up maynard zed it s maynard the spider just caught a coupl a flies marsellus

word maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them we hear on the other side of the curtains maynard let zed inside the store butch and marsellus look around the room the basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon after taking in their predicament butch and marsellus look at each other all traces of hostility gone replaced by a terror they both share at what they ve gotten themselves into maynard and zed come through the curtains zed is an even more intense version of maynard if such a thing is possible the two hillbillys are obviously

into russell s old room russell no doubt was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the mason dixie pawnshop whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room a back room in the back of the back room is empty as marsellus is dragged away he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russell s old room maynard up the gimp rises maynard ties the gimp s leash to a hook on the ceiling maynard keep an eye on this one the gimp bows its head yes maynard disappears into russell s old room there must be a stereo in there because suddenly the judds singing in harmony fills the air butch looks at the gimp the gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy from behind the door we hear country music struggling and maynard whoa this boy s got a bit of fight in em we the hear maynard and zed beat on marsellus zed you wanna fight you wanna fight good i like to fight butch pauses listens to the voices then in a panic hurriedly struggles to get free the gimp is laughing wildly the ropes are on too tight and butch can t break free the gimp slaps his knee laughing in the back room we hear maynard that s it that s it boy you re goin fine oooooooh just like that that s good stay still stay still goddamn ya zed goddammit git over here and hold em butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms then quite easily the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt the gimp sees this and its eyes widen the gimp huhng the gimp flails wildly trying to get the leash off the hook he tries to yell but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts butch is out of his chair quickly dispensing three boxer s punches to its face the punches knock the gimp out making him fall to his knees this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook butch removes the ball gag then silently makes his way through the red curtains int pawnshop day butch sneaks to the door on the counter is a big set of keys with a large z connected to the ring grabbing them he s about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with marsellus butch decides for the life of him he can t leave anybody in a situation like that se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies heads in with he picks up a big destructive looking hammer then discards it not destructive enough he picks up a chainsaw thinks about it for a moment then puts it back next a large louisville slugger he tries on for size but then he spots what he s been looking for a samurai sword it hands in its hand carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall next to a neon dad s old fashioned root beer sign butch takes the sword off the wall removing it from its sheath it s a magnificent piece of steel it seems to glisten in the low wattage light of the pawnshop butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show not on your life it s as sharp as it gets this weapon seems made to order for the brothers grimm downstairs holding the sword pointed downward takakura kenstyle he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business int pawnshop back room day butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon sodomy and the judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to russell s old room int russell s old room day butch s hand comes into frame pushing the door open it swings open silently revealing the rapists who have switched positions zed is now bent over marsellus who is bent over a wooden horse maynard watches both have their backs to butch maynard faces the camera grinning while butch comes up behind him with the sword miserable violated and looking like a rag doll marsellus red ball gag still in mouth opens his watery eyes to see butch coming up behind maynard his eyes widen butch hey hillbilly maynard turns and sees butch holding the sword butch screams with one mighty swing slashes maynard across the front moving past him eyes and blade now locked on zed maynard stands trembling his front sliced open in shock butch while never taking his eyes off zed thrusts the sword behind him skewering maynard then extracts it pointing the blade toward zed maynard collapses zed disengages from marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of butch s sword to marsellus 45 automatic which lies within reach butch s eyes follow zed s butch you want that gun zed pick it up zed s hand inches toward the weapon butch grips the sword tighter zed studies butch butch looks hard at zed then a voice says marsellus step aside butch butch steps aside revealing marsellus standing behind him holding maynard s pump action shotgun kaboom zed is blasted in the groin down he goes screaming in agony marsellus looking down at his whimpering rapist ejects the used shotgun shell butch lowers the sword and hangs back not a word until butch you okay marsellus naw man i m pretty fuckin far from okay long pause butch what now marsellus what now well let me tell you what now i m gonna call a couple pipe hittin niggers

inscribing poems on the walls of barracks disguised as homes clipped their wings and they called it angel island though why would we fly any closer to a coast of violence with no rights to testify against whites barred from business licenses and real estate rights a lot of colonies had salient convictions the uk label was aliens restriction mother maple had a head tax fail us an aussie policy literally called white australia six decades of a chinese exclusion act had a president executive producing that and 442 came home from war to prove they were fighting for some brutes still trying to

they hold flogging every message that we might send every speech never speaks to the right gents no ears for the destitute whys every oppressor surprised somebodys ready to fight them this hollow struggle for change to see a slight bend rather than a break from status with every night spent laboring to give women and people of color the right to vote for a selection of white men its not my dream to be livid delivering diatribes cant repair these relations well live and die a tribe but still im calling for progress cause even crawling is honestly faster than waiting for kings to develop a conscience keep making promises to all of the so called godless while building nations on a history of violence and conquest so well be scaling the fortress well be fighting the office and well brandish the truth though we might not be the strongest bring your army and ill bring my heart sling your arrows ill be using them to etch my art you may have trampled us over you may have knocked us down but theres a harmony within us that will always resound its not a fight to be victors its not a grab at the crown its a dream of unity even when were kicked to the ground cause even though i have anger my love is limitless loud and the longer it lasts it grows ever closer the clouds stronger than animosity thats why im finishing proud cause i have learned from every corner of a menacing crowd we all deserve respect and peace put your enmity down the songs that i blast you cant diminish the sound history marches and i dont fight for the wrongs of the past but the sins of the now were

into themselves during this period they make generalizations about the host culture and wonder how the people can live like they do your students may feel that their own culture s lifestyle and customs are far superior to those of the host country the nuns were worried about mirabella too to correct a failing you must first be aware of it as a failing and there was mirabella shucking her plaid jumper in full view of the visiting cardinal mirabella battling a raccoon under the dinner table while the rest of us took dainty bites of peas and borscht mirabella doing belly flops into compost you have to pull your weight around here we overheard sister josephine saying one night we paused below the vestry window and peered inside does mirabella try to earn skill points by shelling walnuts and polishing saint in the box no does mirabella even know how to say the word walnut has she learned how to say anything besides a sinful hraaaha as she commits frottage against the organ pipes no there was a long silence something must be done sister ignatius said firmly the other nuns nodded a sea of thin colorless lips and kettle black brows something must be done they intoned that ominously passive construction a something so awful that nobody wanted to assume responsibility for it i could have warned her if we were back home and mirabella had come under attack by territorial beavers or snow blind bears i would have warned her but the truth is that by stage 3 i wanted her gone mirabella s inability to adapt was taking a visible toll her teeth were ground down to nubbins her hair was falling out she hated the spongy long dead foods we were served and it showed her ribs were poking through her uniform her bright eyes had dulled to a sour whiskey color but you couldn t show mirabella the slightest kindness anymore she d never leave you alone you d have to sit across from her at meals shoving her away as she begged for your scraps i slept fitfully during that period unable to forget that mirabella was living under my bed gnawing on my loafers it was during stage 3 that we met our first purebred girls these were girls raised in captivity volunteers from st lucy s school for girls the apple cheeked fourth grade class came to tutor us in playing they had long golden braids or short severe bobs they had frilly duvet names like felicity and beulah and pert bunny noses and terrified smiles we grinned back at them with genuine ferocity it made us nervous to meet new humans there were so many things that we could do wrong and the rules here were different depending on which humans we were with dancing or no dancing checkers playing or no checkers playing pumping or no pumping the purebred girls played checkers with us these girl girls sure is dumb my sister lavash panted to me between games i win it again five to none she was right the purebred girls were making mistakes on purpose in order to give us an advantage king me i growled out of turn i say king me and felicity meekly complied beulah pretended not to mind when we got frustrated with the oblique fussy movement from square to square and shredded the board to ribbons i felt sorry for them i wondered what it would be like to be bred in captivity and always homesick for a dimly sensed forest the trees you ve never seen jeanette was learning how to dance on holy thursday she mastered a rudimentary form of the charleston brava the nuns clapped brava every friday the girls who had learned how to ride a bicycle celebrated by going on chaperoned trips into town the purebred girls sold seven hundred rolls of gift wrap paper and used the proceeds to buy us a yellow fleet of bicycles built for two we d ride the bicycles uphill a sanctioned pumping a grim faced nun pedaling behind each one of us congratulations the nuns would huff being human is like riding this bicycle once you ve learned how you ll never forget mirabella would run after the bicycles growling out our old names hwraa gwarr trrrrrrr we pedaled faster at this point we d had six weeks of lessons and still nobody could do the sausalito but jeanette the nuns decided we needed an inducement to dance they announced that we would celebrate our successful rehabilitations with a debutante ball there would be brothers ferried over from the home for man boys raised by wolves there would be a photographer from the gazette sophisticate there would be a three piece jazz band from west toowoomba and root beer in tiny plastic cups the brothers we d almost forgotten about them our invisible tails went limp i should have been excited instead i felt a low mad anger at the nuns they knew we weren t ready to dance with the brothers we weren t even ready to talk to them things had been so much simpler in the woods that night i waited until my sisters were asleep then i slunk into the closet and practiced the sausalito two step in secret a private mass of twitch and foam mouth shut shoes on feet mouth shut shoes on feet mouthshutmouthshut one night i came back early from the closet and stumbled on jeanette she was sitting in a patch of moonlight on the windowsill reading from one of her library books her cheeks looked dewy why you cry i asked her instinctively reaching over to lick jeanette s cheek and catching myself in the nick of time jeanette blew her nose into a nearby curtain she sniffled and pointed to a line in her book the lake water was reinventing the forest and the white moon above it and wolves lapped up the cold reflection of the sky but none of the pack besides me could read yet and i wasn t ready to claim a common language with jeanette the following day jeanette golfed the nuns set up a miniature put put course in the garden sister maria dug four sand traps and got clyde the groundskeeper to make a windmill out of a lawnmower engine the eighteenth hole was what they called a doozy a minuscule crack in st lucy s marble dress jeanette got a hole in one on sundays the pretending felt almost as natural as nature the chapel was our favorite place long before we could understand what the priest was saying the music instructed us in how to feel the choir director aggressively perfumed mrs valuchi gold necklaces like pineapple rings around her neck taught us more than the nuns ever did she showed us how to pattern the old hunger into arias clouds moved behind the frosted oculus of the nave glass shadows that reminded me of my mother the mother i d think struggling to conjure up a picture a black shadow running behind the watery screen of pines we sang at the chapel annexed to the halfway house every morning we understood that this was the human s moon the place for howling beyond purpose not for mating not for hunting not for fighting not for anything but the sound itself and we d howl along with the choir hurling every pitted thing within us at the stained glass sotto voce the nuns would frown but you could tell that they were

foot was mangled i was woken up earlier by what i thought was a cat tangle but it was him who got it bad from the cat that night he moved slowly down the hill when he slipped under the fence i propped myself up to check him out and he found nook under the air conditioner i pointed him out to caroline and she crouched down and he was shaking and full of fear and when she stood up i asked baby why are you crying she said because he s cute and he s down there and he s dying i went up to my room and i got a call from justin he was in san francisco and godflesh was playing caroline drove me halfway there where i met tony and we drove to the city and we parked out in front of the dna justin and us we had some laughs and we took photographs backstage and our guts were protruding in all of them and we just kept laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and when godflesh took the stage tony and i we stood there floored drum machines hammered and feedback blazed and for a moment everybody grew silent while justin tuned his guitar like a church it got so quiet just for a minute and then they all soared together like a car off a cliff they crashed and burned over and over and again and again they threw hard vicious guttural b flats that shook their opponent like a tough roberto hands of stone durn seventh round davey moore june 16 1983 godflesh shook the ramp that night like an early mark gator rogowski justin lunged at the mic like a hungry great white he was on fire giving everything he had and killing it that night tearing at his prey and then it came to a screeching halt a relentless and beautiful and glorious 70 minute assault and then he bowed down and set his seven string electric guitar down and it screeched to holy hell and they disappeared and off went the crowd then we had pizza and i came back to my apartment in the city until 4am i watched movies and my ears were ringing and i called caroline out at the house and we talked about the concert and about the possum down in the nook and the ocean air came through my window and the sound of foghorns and then when i awoke godflesh was down in la and tony had an open house that day and i looked out at sausalito and caroline was on her way back from lake tahoe i got a call from paolo sorrentino i d be off to switzerland in a week or so caroline came home that night and we had dinner and watched hbo and i m grateful for her love and for my friends and to have seen the possum walk its last walk among the ivy i want to grow old and to walk the last walk knowing that i too gave it everything i got against all roadblocks and obstacles i fought for to live another day is much better than to not and i d like to die with music in my ears the piano of maurice ravel or godflesh s guttural growls from hell the sound that evokes good memories of being young and able to get around and i d like caroline beside me that old possum lost the fight his sad black eyes what a thing to see on a glowing easter sunday but that rodent was loved and he s still thought of and church bells rang that day i remember hearing them in the afternoon just as we left he had to have heard them

pulse is converted to half notes i breathe out and take the rhythm in the medicine for my emotional predicament cause when it happens to you it seems different but deep down you know it s really the

same beat the rhythm that i live my heart beats musical equivalent pumping refrains through my veins so lovingly it brings you back to an astonishing recovery and usually it s even harder to let the pain go cause when the storm is the norm you re depressed and you re wrecked you can start to forget that after all the strain it s rain that makes thangs grow and i know if you re goal is to hold on

and somewhat infamous ex ghostbuster venkman he turns to camera and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone understated and intimate venkman hi welcome back to the world of the psychic i m peter venkman and i m chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic milton anglund milt your new book is called the end of the world isn t that kind of like writing about gum disease yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it milton well i think it s important for people to know that the world is in danger venkman okay so can you tell us when it s going to happen or do we have to buy the book milton i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year s eve venkman this year that s cutting it a little close isn t it i mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right so you re not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year and it s going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even 94 just to be safe milton this is not just some money making scheme i didn t just make up the date i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year s eve venkman well for your sake i hope you re right but i think my other guest may disagree with you elaine you had another date in mind the camera reveals elaine an attractive aggressive new jersey housewife sitting on the other side of venkman elaine according to my sources the world will end on february 14 in the year 2016 venkman valentine s day that s got to be a bummer where did you get that date elaine elaine i received this information from an alien i was at the paramus holiday inn i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that s where he told me about the end of the world venkman your alien had a room in the holiday inn elaine it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn i can t be sure peter venkman no you can t and i think that s the whole problem with aliens you just can t trust them you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e t but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard anyway we re just

waiting for two hours and we ve been gradually increasing the temperature in the room it s up to 95 degrees at the moment now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if they d mind waiting another half hour as spengler dana and the research team watch the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay they explode with anger both at him and each other while spengler

in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute venkman and now you re going to eat it stantz no i m just restoring it to its normal state he takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a large petri dish stantz now watch this he leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it stantz you worthless piece of slime you ignorant disgusting blob specimen it bubbles and swells changing color with each insult stantz you foul obnoxious muck stantz he continues venting his rage on the slime stantz i ve seen some real crud in my time but you re a chemical disgrace the specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the petri dish stantz and spengler they turn to venkman for his reaction he s dumbfounded venkman this is what you do with your spare time stantz this is an incredible breakthrough venkman a psychoreactive substance whatever this is it clearly responds to human emotional states venkman mood slime we ought to bottle this stuff and sell it spengler we ve found it at every event site we ve been to lately winston you mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes stantz like a goat on garbage stantz we re running tests to see if we can get

starts to shrink winston does it have any favorites stantz it likes all the sappy stuff cumbaya everything is beautiful it s a small world but it loves jackie wilson venkman and winston watch intently as spengler spoons some of the psych reactive slime onto an old toaster stantz watch this stantz turns on a cassette player and jackie wilson s higher and higher blasts from the speakers toaster it shakes spins and actually starts moving in time with the music venkman he stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat venkman i don t care what you say this could be a major christmas gift item winston right and the first time someone gets mad their toaster will eat their hand venkman so we ll put a warning on the label stantz turns off the music and the toaster stops moving venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot venkman go ahead i dare you suddenly he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and won t let go the others jump in to help him but venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand venkman just kidding cut to int dana s apartment night dana brings oscar

the bottom of the tub dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub when she turns away both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges dana still unaware she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub bathtub the rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath dana she picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub she is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth dana screams snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime cut to int venkman s loft same night the big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched

said if that was my desire ze cherries jubilee is magnifique but when he brought it heck it was still on fire and i jumped up and throwed a bowl of that cold potater soup on it before it could set off the sprinkler system probably saved em from a major fire but did they appreciate it no asked me not to never come back no need to worry about that they said the food at that place was fit for a king
