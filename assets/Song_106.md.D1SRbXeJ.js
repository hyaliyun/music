homeboys and we just gonna call him junior yeah junior got some money just for being a good kid he sealed it up and never even opened up the lid girls gave him candy cause he treated him nice he took it home and chopped it up and doubled up the price miss thomas at the parent s conference said we honest she was astonished at his confidence and what he accomplished he respected his elders but he knew who he liked he listened before he talked and he never would fight it s like everybody knew him or they wanted to know him and anytime they did something for him they felt that they owed him he was learning a life game that no one would show him he had more than an idea of where he was going he grew into a young man and gained some trust and he had a knack for pleasing people and that was a plus any situation he was in he would adjust he never cussed and he never fussed what he discussed yeah that s what i m talking about we was the same age but i still looked up to him because we had this thing together some people just got that knack and you can t do nothing about it but they end up being a victim of circumstance because he s on the rise and you know he s gotta battle against the odds and my man had such a good demeanor he was smart man and he was a hustler and he had his and he had a natural ability to bring people together and which people he brought together by the time he turned 26 he was a he was becoming a young prince with a whole lot of sense not only could he make money hustling white he had a little bit of everything to get you some height they made cash with him so nobody wanted to hit him but they d get him if they had to get him get rid of him quick but why kill off the goose if you re making grip and why kill off the captain if you run a good ship some people are strong some people are weak other are smart but still don t got a stomach for the streets but junior had a different angle he was an angel the game could tango cause he can t tango a dance with wolves or waltz with a rattlesnake what would it prove they started but he stayed cool and he stayed steady making moves yeah okay meanwhile junior s off doing his thing and living up to his full potential but the haters and i don t even want to call them that cause they re worse than that but he s become a victim of the monster you know the machine the revolving door it s them that got versus them that can t get and ain t gonna never get junior had it good man four years later junior got him a nice stack compared to what he used to have now he s got twice that when beef is at his door he decided to ice that now knowing more and more he was caught in a mice trap he wanted to fight back but who could he tell the lesser of the two evils would just put him in a cell everybody around knew that junior was frail but he didn t need muscles to make it all he needed was a scale a hundred and twenty thousand in cold hard cash a stash at gun blast that don t even ask you get beat by the only one thing that can beat you defeat you cheat you the streets will eat you jealousy and envy make a person deceitful then you add greed to it combonation is lethal well it s a short life knowing that it won t be a sequel sometimes bad things just happen to good people yeah so they killed him they murdered him in cold blood he died face down in front of an empty safe and for the fools that did this

had they stepped on his profits they d be finished cause getting his is what he was about ever since his birth he was a nuisance to humanity i wish he died instead of mom maybe then i d love family but i d smile at pops concealing that feeling of i hate you each day he d wear the same three colors with the same suit and mother would come to me when i would close my eyes and sink to the thought

maybe i don t deserve to be happy but since misery loves a company why don t you stick around with me and what you promised me from the start you break as easily as my heart so come and watch me fall

meetings to help ensure the best possible recommendations for the department the dsb report on cyber security and reliability in a digital cloud is a publicly available document hosted on the dod website it is the result of a study by a task force chartered by the department to conduct an independent assessment of the suitability of cloud computing architectures for dod applications key factors in the assessment included dod mission enhancements cyber security benefits and risks and potential cost savings associated with cloud computing the task force was made up of some real heros of national security related it great champions who have spent years in service to science for our national security the task force was chaired by dr eric evans and dr robert grossman two of the smartest hardest working and kindest people i ve ever met the task force offers important recommendations for dod focused on identifying and applying cloud computing resources to dod mission areas improving dod s implementation of cloud computing enhancing cloud resiliency in degraded operations and in identifying areas requiring further research and development the bottom line of this report for sensitive data well engineered private clouds are a better approach than any public cloud option at this point in the words of the task force co chairs the task force recommends that for sensitive classified or time critical applications the dod should pursue private cloud computing to enhance mission capabilities provided that strong security measures are in place this report recommends several improvements in cloud computing implementations to strengthen cyber security and reliability there is special focus on modern cloud computing architectures and data center designs supportive of mission needs there is an entire section on the architecture of the modern cloud data center this section lays out very well the benefits of modular systems and underscores their finding and recommendation on modular data centers they find that modular data centers offer an approach to quickly set up cloud computing capacity to add additional capability to existing cloud computing data centers and to easily refresh or update existing capability for more on this report download it here cyber security and reliability in a digital

mouth i m turned up she s turned out and burnt out running from a pimp who ripped her perm out i listen to the truths of the youth misguided i used to turn tricks til it got too violent her eye lid swollen shut the left side i drive to the 110 at the west side the year she was hexed to sex the next guy her skirt s turned aside revealing the left thigh i get off on cage left on vigaroa she asked

drive you through the night down the hills i m gonna tell you something you don t want to hear i m gonna show you where it s dark but have no fear there s something inside you it s hard to explain

over ridden by the vision of my passenger s worth i m writing a passionate verse i m laughing at first thinking about jesus christ and his nazareth birth yo i ve been paid to kill by the men at the

a pint like he s trying to find life in the very thing that is killing him filling his mind s violence the fires in his iris are evident delicate sediment settles as evidence each morning in the corner of worn eyelids and as that first ever worse bite of sunlight finds him he turns child and tries hiding i saw her walking past me on new cross road with a face i know from mirrors another girl with the same demons to deliver i got that feeling in my liver the magnetism of the apparition she thinks the same but she dresses different imprisoned in time with a glitch in her mind viciously sinking its teeth in her spine run from ourselves but there s nowhere to hide come face to face beneath flickering lights we are the same but with different lives always separate always together once

leader carved a path with the things i d written except i mostly hate the words that leave my mouth straight after i spit them me too she could ve been so much more they said that s when they shook their heads they don t know the things that i sacrificed how i d given my life for the raps i write glad with every molecule that i lived the life that i wanted to all i could ever be is me as it s

they shouting on the mic its like they may as well mumble cos we the dudes about to hunt you like the king of the jungle yeah i said it but only cos im setting it straight do you get it dont worry ill wait but not for too long cos i ain t trying to humble my pace they call me black jack cos im about to cover my ace its d and marcus we marvelous and making our mark and we stars but yall can only see

are musical prophets so notes meet hope and we about to save this music from a slippery slope cos we tired of these rappers tired of these actors tired of gun clappers taking the art backwards screaming that they are about to blow but it aint them running the show so it dont mean nothing if you had a meeting with a major label it only really matters when a deal is on the table and even then they aint your friend they probably going to rape you then take you to a foreign place and planet of the ape you then leave you there a couple years you feeling like they hate you and when you start to shout they say cmon its only day two so i do it like theres no time left and dont listen to empty promises while holding my breath  time waits for no man and no mans island those are the 2 things i try and keep in mind and put food for thought in everything im rhyming id rather be silent than speaking all violent see things changed in this world and environment it feels like smiling aint a natural requirement people talk bad or they have no comment the years spin and i wonder where the time went so i got no time for these harlequins jokers they leave you the bottom have to start again the place where you got to find the patience and the heart again and all because you couldnt figure out whats in the heart of men we only get the once chance of youth im telling the truth just look

and licked his hand and lay down at his feet he said if you spare me that drink dutchman i promise i ll tell you how that i came to be the helpless sight that stands before you now i used to be an artist not one who sits and fiddle out on the curb but in my day and time my music was considered superb i wrote a song about a poor kid raised down in new orleans it didn t make the hall of fame but it bought us shrimp rice and beans he kept at it until it made the big time playing town after town until he met a woman he fell in love with and it really turned his life around she had eyes like cleopatra and a head of luxurious hair with the brilliance of her beauty none other could compare when she lifted her eyes to his her lips would fall apart each time she allowed him kiss her it near petrified his heart but when he ask her would she marry him he d give her everything he had she turned and walked away and it nearly drove him mad he promised her a half a million and would even pay in advance if she would let him prove himself or at least give him a chance and if he should go blind and had to use his hands to feel he would hire someone to do her work and prepare her every meal how could a man love a woman so much not one of you would think well i did and i still do hey dutchman you promised me a drink","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:
