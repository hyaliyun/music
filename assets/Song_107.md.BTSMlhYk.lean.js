bones and with a sound of his own the little drummer boy was sure to be a name that was known first name tom second name tom he knew he was different not insignificant nor noticeably brilliant although maybe lacking resilience something inside of him knew he was different from the millions from the way he would put his hi hat on as he walked out the door to way that he knew there was more than sight to be explored to the way he would always keep both pedals on the floor something inside of him knew he was made to make noise but the little drummer boy had a problem he lacked true purpose often wondered if the sound he made was worth it would let alone receive the attention to become birthed until one day he decided his sound would never become heard that the risk of a note out of place was not worth it even for the chance to be great so hed hold back and hed be guaranteed to never let failure be his fate but it hadnt always been like this hed been one to overthink it and it was all because of the string kids see the string kids they thought they were wired to be the tyrants although not bigger violent violas and violins seemed to silence his inner fire like hydrants until one day he decided they were right hed be quiet he was a drummer not one for the drama so he would let their noise bring down his own until he started to feel hopeless fretting through the moments that were once his highest because now they had become his lowest until he was ready to let himself become unnoticed all because they were jealous of his talent others would lack it and thought they had to have it to cause havoc while he had it and would use it to create magic as a habit but he no longer felt like an inhabitant in his own orchestra and every sound that everyone else made from then on to him sounded so orchestrated but that was until he met little miss pianist who skipped past elegantly playing her favourite melody about how everything is meant to be how were all a part of something greater and sometimes thats further than what we can see and from the second he saw her he instantly had an epiphany implicitly he promised hed write her a symphony to the best of his ability with all his creativity and itd have everything shed ever need right down to the last timpani and she loved it he would start to tell her she had the keys to his heart but it didnt feel dangerous because she knew how to scale back his minors until all he saw were his majors and he would tell her each one of his hidden dreams and driven vivid visions from his inner musician to his outer ambitions because she would listen and when he would swing she would swing with him and on the good they would reminisce and every joke that she told he was always there ready with the ba dom

without breaks and without clean breaks without beautiful ideas in breaks you dont need to even think about doin anything else if you cant have a decent break you havent got a jazz band or you cant even play jazz show us a good break jelly now thats what youd call a pretty good break for instance ill play just a little bit of a melody of somethin and show you thats what youd call a break maybe id better play something that you can understand more for instance strutters ball i made those blakes breaks kind of clean because the fact of it is everybody knows this tune and they know how its played and theyll know where the breaks come in without a break you have nothing even if a tune have no break in it it is always necessary to arrange some kind of a spot to make a break because without a break as i said before you havent gotten jazz and er your accurate tempos with your backgrounds of your figures which is called riffs today of course that that happens to be a musical term riffs whats the difference between a riff and a break arent they about the same thing oh no no theres a difference er a riff is a background a riff is what you would call a foundation as like you would walk on its something thats standard and a break is something that you break when you make the break that means all the band break with maybe one two or three instruments it depends upon how the combination is arranged and as you as the band breaks you have a set given time possibly two bars to make the break isnt isnt the break what you when you when you make break isnt that what you mean by

adventuress and courtesan the pride of alexandria and thais was her name nearby in peace and piety avoiding all society there dwelt a band of holy men who d made their refuge there and in the desert s solitude they spurned all earthly folly to devote their lives to holy works to fasting and to prayer now one monk whom i solely mention of this band of holy men was known as athaneal he was famous near and far at fasting bouts and prayer with him none other could compare with him at plain and fancy praying he could do the course in par one day while sleeping heavily from wresting with the devil he had gone to bed exhausted though the sun was shining still he had a vision freudian and though he was annoyed he an alyzed it in the well known style of doctors jung and brill he dreamed of alexandria of wicked alexandria a crowd of men was cheering in a manner rather rude and athaneal glancing there at thais who was dancing there observed her do the shimmy in what artists call the nude said he this dream fantastical disturbs my thoughts monastical some unsuppressed desire i fear has found my monkish cell i blushed up to the hat o me to view that girl s anatomy i ll go to alexandria and save her soul from hell so pausing not to wonder where he d put his winter underwear he quickly packed his evening clothes a toothbrush and a vest to guard against exposure he threw in some woolen hosiery and bidding all the boys adieu he started on his quest  the monk though warned and fortified was deeply shocked and mortified to find on his arrival wild debauchery in sway while some were in a stupor sent by booze of more than two percent the rest were all behaving in a most immoral way said he to thais pardon me although this job is hard on me i ve got to put you straight to what i came out hear to tell what s all this boozin gettin you cut out this pie eyed retinue let s hit the road together kid and save you soul from hell although this bold admonishment caused thais some astonishment she quickly answered say you said a heaping mouthful bo this burg s a frost i m telling you the brand of hooch they re selling you ain t like the stuff you used to get so let s pack up and go so off from alexandria from wicked alexandria across the desert sands they go beneath the burning sun till thais parched and sweltering finds refuge in the sheltering seclusion of a convent in the habit of a nun and now the monk is terrified to find his fears are verified his holy vows of chastity have cracked beneath the strain like one who has a jag on he cries out in grief and agony i d sell my soul to see her do the shimmy once again alas his pleadings amorous though passionate and clamorous have come too late the courtesan has danced her final dance said he now that s a joke on me

they re on their knees screaming and bleeding the pain is ceasing let it out it is relieving both finding peace when still dont do just be afterall we re human beings not human doings who all need some healing when death is passed through us with them hazy eyes we share pains alike day and night thinking about you i feel the pain in my mind looking for that life line in the night sky though patterns twisted kinda like a tie dye ye we know that life s finite so why try to hide like the pain isnt there when in hindsight well i probably wallowed in it too much and didn t see who i still had until i grew up relate through mistakes life lessons define life s essence behind my questions no easy answers but infinite suggestions stop let me hold your weight up while you re resting put aggression to the side let the shield down not time to fight cos we must heal now looking up and its greay so you feel down but we gotta live each day not see em out your mind reeling it s time for

without breaks and without clean breaks without beautiful ideas in breaks you dont need to even think about doin anything else if you cant have a decent break you havent got a jazz band or you cant even play jazz show us a good break jelly now thats what youd call a pretty good break for instance ill play just a little bit of a melody of somethin and show you thats what youd call a break maybe id better play something that you can understand more for instance strutters ball i made those blakes breaks kind of clean because the fact of it is everybody knows this tune and they know how its played and theyll know where the breaks come in without a break you have nothing even if a tune have no break in it it is always necessary to arrange some kind of a spot to make a break because without a break as i said before you havent gotten jazz and er your accurate tempos with your backgrounds of your figures which is called riffs today of course that that happens to be a musical term riffs whats the difference between a riff and a break arent they about the same thing oh no no theres a difference er a riff is a background a riff is what you would call a foundation as like you would walk on its something thats standard and a break is something that you break when you make the break that means all the band break with maybe one two or three instruments it depends upon how the combination is arranged and as you as the band breaks you have a set given time possibly two bars to make the break isnt isnt the break what you when you when you make break isnt that what you mean by

my matilda all over then in 1915 my country said son it s time you stopped rambling there s work to be done so they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun and they marched me away to the war and the band played waltzing matilda as the ship pulled away from the quay and amidst all the cheers the flag waving and cheers we sailed off for gallipoli and how well i remember that terrible day how our blood stained the sand and the water and of how in that hell that they called suvla bay we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter johnny turk he was ready he d primed himself well he rained us with bullets and he showered us with shell and in five minutes flat we were all blown to hell nearly blew us right back to australia but the band played waltzing matilda when we stopped to bury our slain we buried ours and the turks buried theirs then we started all over again and those that were left well we tried to survive in that mad world of blood death and fire and for ten weary weeks i kept myself alive though around me the corpses piled higher then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head and when i woke up in my hospital bed and saw what it had done and i wished i was dead never knew there was worse things than dyin for i ll go no more waltzing matilda all around the green bush far and near to hang tent and pegs a man needs both legs no more waltzing matilda for me so they gathered the crippled the wounded the maimed and they shipped us back home to australia the legless the armless the blind the insane those proud wounded heroes of suvla and when the ship pulled into circular quay i looked at the place where me legs used to be and thanked christ there was nobody waiting for me to grieve to mourn and to pity but the band played waltzing matilda as they carried us down the gangway but nobody cheered they just stood and stared then they turned all their faces away and so now every april i sit on me porch and i watch the parade pass before me and i see my old comrades how proudly they march renewing their dreams of past glory and the old men march slowly old bones stiff and sore the weary heroes of a forgotten war and the young people ask what are they marching for and i ask myself the same question  but the band plays waltzing matilda and the old men still answer the call but as year follows year the numbers get fewer someday no one will march

then i fumbled in my closet through my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt then i washed my face and combed my hair and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day i d smoked my mind the night before with cigarettes and songs i d been picking but i lit my first and watched a small kid playing with a can that he was kicking then i walked across the street and caught the sunday smell of someone frying chicken and lord it took me back to something that i d lost somewhere somehow along the way on a sunday morning sidewalk i m wishing lord that i was stoned cause there s something in a

a laughing little girl that he was swinging and i stopped beside a sunday school and listened to the songs they were singing then i headed down the street and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing and it echoed through the canyon like the disappearing dreams of yesterday on a sunday morning sidewalk i m wishing lord that i was stoned cause there s something in a sunday that makes a body
