money that the robbers took from the bank does that mean oh you see there s really no economic interest involved then they re not protecting the banks the police are just doing this cause they re on a a power trip or they re macho or they re control freaks that s why they do it no of course it s an economicof course they re defending the banksof course because if they didn t stop that bank robbery regardless of the cost this could jeopardize the entire banking system you see there are people who believe that the function of the police is to fight crime and that s not true the function of the

after all this time and i owe it all to you you re the one that got me through you wrote my story looking back on high school i see how foolish that i really was i thought i was the coolest that there ever was til i went off to college and learned nobody there even knew who i was it all taught me that i fall short like junior year when they cut me even though i left it all on the court i had to learn how to fail and to fall so i could learn how to get up shake the dust off walk and stand taller learn how to call on the one who s been there through it all i remember when i got the phone call freshman year in virginia my grandfather passed away eight years after my grandmother guess he couldn t wait to see her on the other side at the funeral i cried so hard i never knew i d hurt that bad inside but over time wounds heal and all that s remembered is the love that we shared while together forever this is my story and i wouldn t change a thing i was put here for a purpose this was written by a king was carefully designed hand crafted and made by the one who s never made a mistake i want to give all it takes from here on out to make up for lost time but what s done is done and i can t press rewind and all of my regrets are chasin me from behind but the future s unwritten i m racin towards the finish line so from here on out everyday counts i know your grace meets me no matter what the amount despite that i m hard hearted you gave me a clean slate and promised that you d finish what you ve started and even though a four minute long song can barely scratch the surface it s sure enough to show i m far from perfect so thank you for the past help me live in the present to prepare me for the future til my story ends","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

they would let me get a peek in hey if theyd just let me put my feet in stead of just locking me out instead of just leaving me freezing im just tryna go and blow im just tryna get to peakin im just tryna get this broad out them dereon jeans and if this never makes it out i guess there wont nothing missed its good to let it out i guess its good to reminisce because everybodys fake and everybodys clueless nobody is really real and that just makes us all foolish for real  you dont have to mute it actually just gotta do this one more time and then just a couple minutes uh first and foremost id definitely like to welcome you guys to reignsound uh let me start off actually there theres this guy he came to me and he was like you know people are always telling you you need to find something to live for you need to find something to live for uh theyre like think about work think about school and maybe if its not that think about a person uh you need to you know dont give up now think about that person and keep moving keep going keep going off of that like let that be your motivation and then he was like yes yes this is true definitely definitely you need you know you need motivation in life but you cant live for anything and if youre gonna live for something live for yourself and you know in my mind im like ahhh you know like he got something he s on to something but i m not really seeing exactly where he s going with this and then he starts to go further and says you know thing come and go people come and go you sit and you start focusing you start centering your life around like this person this thing and then basically whenever that thing person whatever is is gone now what are you left with now basically it s like you might as well just kick the bucket now uh nah but he had told me that and i was like dang that s one smart guy but actually that story came when i was in the mirror i was talking to myself that wasn t really somebody that told me that but uh reignsound definitely it s a project that i feel like is alot more personal uh versus you know senioritis definitely had some some stories in there some you know i was definitely feeling senioritis you know at the time being then that s that s personal to then and this is this is closer to how i am now and i feel like you know some people i might get some more people to hop on board some people might you know be like ahhh you know it s not the guy i signed up for uh it s whatever i can t really like hold anybody to that uh i mean it s i mean it is what it is i was stressing alot like towards the beginning of this project just cause you know i m thinking about like the people that are shouting out on twitter like yoo i love this track i love this track and then you know it kind of just like it all just got in my head and i m like ahh i gotta you know produce something similar i gotta produce something similar and then at some point it just clicked and i m like i can t like stress myself sticking to a structure i never had a structure before so it s like i need to stick to the process that i was working on before and just go based off how i feel go based of that don t worry about how it s gonna turn out how people are gonna think how people are gonna feel about it and i ended up with reignsound uh i had the uh title in mind for quite a while but the whole concept behind

home and its usually the resident anywhere you go if its there it is evident matter fact theres no where in the world that its never been timeless because its always relevant beautiful but it isnt always elegant sometimes its simplistic and innocent fightin it at first but eventually you let it in it can be a thought or family support once it hits you like a viral infection youre caught you wouldnt be at fault if youre spreadin it around when it seems the troubles of the worlds gettin you down if it is sound then it sound like this overflowing with passion til you drown in bliss chorus you can smell it taste it see it touch it embrace it its the helpin hand and constant friend always there anytime or place its so complex yet oh so simple expressed through smiles and dimples soft eyes and body language you try but you cant contain it its a four letter word a noun and a verb but it easily takes a page to define it its clear only the hand of god could design it whenever my daughter reaches for me im reminded of how one that can barely speak can express it and be a recipient of it though you didnt request it even in a sincere smile its suggested often found in a pound hug or gratitude we even put it on display through our attitude and a dose of it can even raise your altitude to find peace thats constant elevation to help you arrive at your final destination whether cloud 9 or its heaven you seek its a universal language so whenever you speak we can all understand cause it shows in your actions to everyone you meet without knowing their reaction chorus bridge sometimes it s hard to find it catch sight you can be blinded this is the power it has built with the strength to outlast you and i yet like water in your hand or seeds sown in fertile land it s precious and we need it in our lives to survive survive it can be physical it can be spiritual might show up when you least expect its a miracle it can be the cause of regret and why youre miserable then again it can make you feel invincible metaphorically speaking and sometimes literal at times hard to find but always visible critical to my life so i use it like its medicinal though that isnt conventional it is part of my ritual and i know im not saying anything original this might not be applicable to every individual but to falsify this feeling should be criminal its no wonder why when

but ah i really need your help and i i got explain myself okay you hear me hello hello is anyone out there i m just hoping you can hear me i m by myself all alone and nearly on the verge of breaking down like every single track and this very instrumental that was meant to make a sound i m not sure if what i ma tell you you heard before but if so i m probably saying it wrong cause if i wasn t then maybe you wouldn t unintentionally play me every time that you were playing a song you might ve thought the same thing if your mind kept playing tricks on you but you and i know you still think this is a concept like i ain t talking to you yeah you who s listening when are you going to wake up so you re not repeating this again you just sitting and standing there like you always do and might not even play this all way through i know when you don t and when you do you re not taking me serious maybe you re talking over me or turn the volume down or cut me off mid sentence i m painstakingly furious you could be asleep but you need you brain awake to be curious cause i m really here on the other side of your speaker and what s standing between us is some wires and a tweeter if you found something to crack it open maybe i could climb through and leave this track that i shouldn t have wrote a rhyme to cause i can t explain it but i think that s how i got here i heard this beat put it on repeat and copped a squat near the speaker and zoned out blazing the ganja jotting about two lines literally writing one behind another so suddenly my eyes crossed and then blurred i was at a loss for words when i got lost in the words i got choked by the letter o but dotted all the i s so i had to cross the t s when we became the same size i kicked the first line in the verse back and it indents so now i m chased by this run on sentence i ran so fast i leaped from the page that s when the paper split then i closed my notebook shut tried to escape this shit so what you think about me sliding through the crack hope you nodding in agreeance and not nodding to the track hello excuse me are you still there if so i m not for sure if that you ever will care in fact i never know and that just doesn t feel fair but i don t want you to go so hello are you still there well if the music still playing i might as well try to finish up what im saying while laying on my ass from falling fast from the mayhem out my book i looked damn im missing a shoe it might have been trapped in the beat that i was listening to cause it was dark and i aint know what direction to walk towards i took a couple steps and stumbled over some chords plugged em in to each other so when they were combined it created this white noise thats how i saw the drumline i seen it hid behind the bass in the mix so i found some strings went over there and got the lace in the kicks i tried em on and they fit perfect then i grabbed the hi hat put it on top of my head let it sit swerved into the left you know how i do it look cool to me then slip my finger through the loop like it was jewelry im sure that you ll agree about how the instruments was stacked too i probably could have took this track and made a tracksuit that would ve made the look complete had i pulled it off but all that rearranging must ve got the beat mad since certain sounds were out of place so now im clashing with symbols while trying not to get beaten by the bass hold up i hope you still following me and i dont lose you so i ma try to keep this story short cause i refuse to i picked my book up ran without making any stops i cut through the chops and hopped over the drops im thinking what if i can write myself up out of here so i decided to look in the book while flipping through the pages for empty paper this punchline punched me and i caught a right hook from a hook it laid me out over the beat like some vocals i woke up and i ve been here ever since you need more evidence  hello hope you ain t leave the room hello hello excuse me are you still there if so i m not for sure if that you ever will care in fact i never know and that just doesn t feel fair but i don t want you to go so hello are you still there aye are you still there aye the song about to go off man can you get me out of here please man c mon man i gotta wait till you play this again c mon dog damn dialing phone number now i gotta call this shit again damn hate this man should ve never smoked with fess tuned into am hotline amen sh please don t let em call tan man hall can only test this morning don t meant for me to go to bed to test

hugging the trigger young blood rushes his heart pounds he knows it gets easier the next time around they re just objects and shadows not women and men learning to kill is a natural thing learning to fear is a matter of habit the more you have done it the better you re at it news from above reach the street there s no hope of living the end is so near tidings of terror a raven s crow shutter your windows lock up your homes we re just a handful a tiny country surrounded by evil they won t let us be they have hate in their hearts and in all that they bring learning to fear is a natural thing cruelty is a matter of habit the more you ve seen it the better you re at it every boy has a tyrant s desire hands behind the head legs spread wide these are times of danger times of despair no room for compassion a soldier can t care our neighbors are vermin they re used to the blood how can they feel pain when they re living in the mud through cruel routine a soldier is born ignorance soon turns to evil in war israel s land is for israel s kin cruelty comes as a natural thing  learning to love is a natural thing it will find a way if you just let it in it will be strange at first but then you ll see it that learning to love is a matter of being being human is a matter of habit a few baby steps then you get better at it to be for one minute just now just recall the opposite side of the towering walls but our hearts have hardened along with our skin we built a bubble and let no one else in we ll be staring in wonder as the angel falls then being human will be a matter of course

dead every morning i was taking dives every night someone came and swept me off my feet in midflight now without a love i really got nothing without a love i d hang up my shoes it d be a world of suffering if this one i was ever to lose so i m hanging on with all of my power i m hanging on as tight as a noose around the midnight hour she said remember that i m easily bruised i ve had everything that i wanted had so much i threw it away she could see that what i needed was never there anyway now everything around me is shifting i m running like a child through a maze but i m never lost completely cause an angel keeps me safe lord without a love i m dead in the water without a love my aim is untrue my blood gets hotter and hotter at the thought of leaving this angel blue i m hanging on with all of my power it s looking like our bodies might fuse and when our cries got louder she said remember that i m easily bruised when i can t let go and if i love too hard i ll hurt my baby so now everything makes sense in the moment and the moment s independent of time but who decides where truth resides your guess is as good as mine so have another sip of the good stuff and have another round on me if this moment lasts forever then the truth we might just see but without a love i don t have an inkling i d be howling every night at the moon and if the stars stop twinkling the end will sure be coming soon so i m hanging on with all of my power in the garden where we re all free to choose any fruit or flower she said remember that i m easily bruised remember that i m easily
