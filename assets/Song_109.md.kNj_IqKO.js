kinds of music on the radio country and western her hair touches my shoulder in the wind the road signs say turn ahead we sing along to songs our parents taught us turn ahead steep cliff her finger is curled around my belt loop steep cliff pay attention the road curves away from me my voices crumples as we clip the guardrail our wheel lift skyward the car spins flips the sky and riverbed fight for supremacy our headlights kick into space all of our clothes float around us her blouse blossoms like a supernova change in the cupholders form constellations glinting in front of your eyes we are astronauts coming back to earth when the nickel stars settle in the dust we hang upside down dangling like marionettes from our seat belts we unbuckle them fall to the ceiling that was never meant to be a floor her collarbone is broken the same one she fractured at six years old the glass is flung around the car in a perfect halo orbit we are freezing in our own solar system and as im blinking in and out of consciousness she speaks to me in a voice that comes from just behind my ears she says all that has ever mattered is volume and if you turn up the speakers past the point of sound to deafening silence you will hear me again i will whisper your name through the cracks in the canyon rocks and you will know that this is heaven knowing that someone will always remember your irises and where you hid your love letters and why you could never speak in anything but short sentences it is not a golden escalator or a glowing choir conveying you into the sky the hand of god down not reach down and pluck you from your earthly shell no the way to heaven is here in your last moments these last half second before your soul shivers out of your bones you will see the candle on your first birthday cake feel the brush of your mothers braid smell your fathers shaving cream on the day he taught you there is a tornado in your throat you will hear our whispered phone calls our entwined i

bloke has his own practice his girlfriend s an actress an old mate of ours from home and they re always great fun so to dinner we ve come the fifth guest is an unknown the hosts have just thrown us together for a favour cause this girl s just arrived from australia and has moved to north london and she s the sister of someone or has some connection as we make introductions i m struck by her beauty she s irrefutably fair with dark eyes and dark hair but as she sits i admit i m a little bit wary because i notice the tip of the wing of a fairy tattooed on that popular area just above the derrire and when she says i m sagittarian i confess a pigeonhole starts to form and is immediately filled with pigeon when she says her name is storm conversation is initially bright and lighthearted but it s not long before storm gets started you can t know anything knowledge is merely opinion she opines over her cabernet sauvignon vis vis some unhippily empirical comment made by me  not a good start i think we re only on pre dinner drinks and across the room my wife widens her eyes silently begs me be nice a matrimonial warning not worth ignoring so i resist the urge to ask storm whether knowledge is so loose weave of a morning when deciding whether to leave her apartment by the front door or the window on her second floor the food is delicious and storm whilst avoiding all meat happily sits and eats while the good doctor slightly pissedly holds court on some anachronistic aspect of medical history when storm suddenly insists but the human body is a mystery science just falls in a hole when it tries to explain the nature of the soul my hostess throws me a glance she like my wife knows there s a chance that i ll be off on one of my rare but fun rants but i shan t my lips are sealed i just want to enjoy the meal and although storm is starting to get my goat i have no intention of rocking the boat although it s becoming a bit of a wrestle because like her meteorological namesake storm has no such concerns for our vessel pharmaceutical companies are the enemy they promote drug dependency at the cost of the natural remedies that are all our bodies need they are immoral and driven by greed why take drugs when herbs can solve it why use chemicals when homeopathic solvents can resolve it i think it s time we all return to live with natural medical alternatives and try as i like a small crack appears in my diplomacy dyke by definition i begin alternative medicine i continue has either not been proved to work or been proved not to work do you know what they call alternative medicine that s been proved to work medicine so you don t believe in any natural remedies on the contrary storm actually before i came to tea i took a remedy derived from the bark of a willow tree a painkiller that s virtually side effect free it s got a weird name darling what was it again maspirin baspirin oh yes aspirin which i paid about a buck for down at the local drugstore the debate briefly abates as my hosts collect plates but when they return with desserts storm pertly asserts shakespeare said it first there are more things in heaven and earth than exist in your philosophy science is just how we re trained to look at reality it doesn t explain love or spirituality how does science explain psychics auras the afterlife the power of prayer i m becoming aware that i m staring i m like a rabbit suddenly trapped in the blinding headlights of vacuous crap maybe it s the hamlet she just misquothed or the fifth glass of wine i just quaffed but my diplomacy dyke groans and the arsehole held back by its stones can be held back no more look storm sorry i don t mean to bore ya but there s no such thing as an aura reading auras is like reading minds or tea leaves or star signs or meridian lines these people aren t plying a skill they re either lying or mentally ill same goes for people who claim they can hear god s demands or spiritual healers who think they ve got magic hands by the way why do we think it s okay for people to pretend they can talk to the dead isn t that totally fucked in the head lying to some crying woman whose child has died and telling her you re in touch with the other side i think that s fundamentally sick do we need to clarify here that there s no such thing as a psychic what are we fucking two do we actually think that horton heard a who do we still believe that santa brings us gifts that michael jackson didn t have facelifts are we still so stunned by circus tricks that we think that the dead would wanna talk to pricks like john edward storm to her credit despite my derision keeps firing off clichs with startling precision like a sniper using bollocks for ammunition you re so sure of your position but you re just closed minded i think you ll find that your faith in science and tests is just as blind as the faith of any fundamentalist wow that s a good point let me think for a bit oh wait my mistake that s absolute bullshit science adjusts its views based on what s observed faith is the denial of observation so that belief can be preserved if you show me that say homeopathy works then i will change my mind i will spin on a fucking dime i ll be as embarrassed as hell yet i will run through the streets yelling it s a miracle take physics and bin it water has memory and whilst its memory of a long lost drop of onion juice seems infinite it somehow forgets all the poo it s had in it you show me that it works and how it works and when i ve recovered from the shock i will take a compass and carve fancy that on the side of my cock everyone is just staring now but i m pretty pissed and i ve dug this far down so i figure in for a penny in for a pound life is full of mysteries yeah but there are answers out there and they won t be found by people sitting around looking serious and saying isn t life mysterious let s sit here and hope let s call up the fucking pope let s go watch oprah interview deepak chopra if you wanna watch telly you should watch scooby doo that show was so cool because every time there was a church with a ghoul or a ghost in a school they looked beneath the mask and what was inside the fucking janitor or the dude who ran the waterslide because throughout history every mystery ever solved has turned out to be not magic does the idea that there might be knowledge frighten you does the idea that one afternoon on wiki fucking pedia might enlighten you frighten you does the notion that there may not be a supernatural so blow your hippy noodle that you would rather just stand in the fog of your inability to google isn t this enough just this world just this beautiful complex wonderfully unfathomable natural world how does it so fail to hold our attention that we have to diminish it with the invention of cheap man made myths and monsters if you re so into your shakespeare lend me your ear to gild refined gold to paint the lily to throw perfume on the violet is just fucking silly or something like that or what about satchmo i see trees of green red roses too and fine if you wish to glorify krishna and vishnu in a post colonial condescending bottled up and labeled kind of way then whatever that s okay but here s what gives me a hard on i am a tiny insignificant ignorant bit of carbon i have one life and it is short and unimportant but thanks to recent scientific advances i get to live twice as long as my great great great great uncleses and auntses twice as long to live this life of mine twice as long to love this wife of mine twice as many years of friends and wine of sharing curries and getting shitty at good looking hippies with fairies on their spines and butterflies on their titties and if perchance i have

can we talk more and touch base savour the one taste swallow your pride a couple times to leave the runway no chip on my shoulder just a place for you to lean on reignite the feeling when the dreams gone we re fleeing to the sweet spot doing circles round the globe a minor hurdle for the soul tryna learn as i evolve god knows i don t believe religion never gave me peace in my youth i was

thought they cared it was misleading yell it with ya chest i m seeing leaves fall off the trees regenerate grow in peace i send this message overseas i hope you see the sense can we talk we all need

but what would i know about the scene in the city that has swallowed up friends lovers and family just give me a village the size of a teacup you re happier here spread out with your eyes closed i feel i should order a drink in celebration to welcome the summer whose first day is ending should you wake you d catch me of course and ask me the wisdom of drinking once more i cast me mind back to yesterdays wedding where we got drunk and fell over i did my best to be polite to a family i d never met but on numerous occasions i guess i could have tried harder of course by the end of the night i was a best friend with everyone and every ones wife but right now i couldn t remember their names no matter how hard ii try as the sun glares through the hotel window i wonder of our future and where it will lead to i wonder if you ll be laying there 10 years 20 years 30 years down the line i ll still be staring out at the street confused about love and life it ll be interesting to see if anyone ever bought those songs of mine if anyone heard those words that i never got quite right i think i can be honest in presuming the world is not exactly going to be leaping out its bed to make me rich using my songs in adverts selling oranges or lemons who knows i may end up owning the whole street or more likely sleeping under tree in the park opposite would the runners keep me awake or would i keep them asleep i d hope i have the sense to move back home as lovely as today is i d imagine the winter would be rather cold i d been told for years that the devil had the best tunes and that the devil lived down here whereas us country folk weren t worth the salt from the road ex pat magazine editors who choose to loose their temper on the easily persuaded northern town dwellers and sure enough 99 percent of the people i meet have scant regard for entertaining me it seems i m too old too slow too quiet and just wrong and i m glad in their cocaine fuelled electronic cabarets i ll be the man at the bar drinking overpriced whiskey from a bar maid who s to good to catch my eye she only works here two nights a week the rest of the time she s a singer in a rock and roll band i bet she d change her tune if i told her my album had peaked at number 172 and that i also had friends who worked in bars and that didn t define who they are though it certainly helps their capacity to drink but i ve strayed off the subject now i ll be leaning over and waking you up and you ll squint at me through the cracks between your eyelids woozy with cider as if you re asking exactly where we are and exactly what i wanted and i ll be happy because we won t be taking anything too seriously1","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

frustration cascading in my skull on the axis back and forth the swinging pendulum so much damage bashing each wall i hear the sand pounding in the hourglass as it falls sometimes i just wish i could shut it all off off the endless rage that tells me something s off off the voice that s spitting lies just turn it off off tear away the scabs i want them off off the demon on my back just pull him off there it is again telling you you can t that lump in your throat you fight to swallow back there it is again hoping that you won t wishing failure but not giving up the ghost silent voices stabbing at peace pushing off fingers from the ledge of sanity like a thousand leeches feeding on your wits making something meaningless seem significant sometimes i just wish i could shut it all off off the endless rage that tells me something s off off the voice that s spitting lies just turn it off off tear away the scabs i want them off off the demon on my back just pull him off  this uninvited guest inside my brain with every threat whispered i feel nothing and when i m at my best it intervenes how can i get anyone else to relate silent voices stabbing at peace on the edge pushing

the lights dim after the sexy ones have become middle aged in their 12 hour life spans when the glitter fades and rests more like sad stars and gold leaf i love naked white sheets how they work like paint thinner to remove last nights fresco how they dry you off after soaking in a tub of room temperature lovers i love the cab rides you take back into yourself away from the still beautiful people who are all elsewhere doing impossibly beautiful things when you arrive home you will greet the mirror like a criminal in a line up with premeditated sins armed with brass knuckles and all the good intentions buried far beneath the rap sheet i plan to be a sinner tonight couldve been something else but looked way too good in my red dress to be anything christian i was talking to three different men in five different languages i was twisting a blunt straw into page forty seven of the coma sutra i was dancing in an attempt to melt the belts off every man in the room but i heard the truth that night a turk speaking spanish didnt know me from adam said t crees en dios pero tu haces malas cosas you believe in god but you do bad things suddenly i realized that i was in a place where all they play is house music but cant really say i felt at home in the barely audible barely recognizable zone between having a good time and simply wasting it i was a glutton with a grin drinking warm gin knowing no ones name but somehow i was everyones friend i was standing in stilettos that made me 6 feet tall but still felt small i was messing up the shoes i paid too much for and still hurt to walk in and talk about conviction truth is nobody believes me when i say im a virgin truth is the bible didnt see the inside of my face for a week while i was on vacation truth is im not innocent im just an abstinent fireplace that doesnt wanna feel the fire kindle between her legs anymore so dont mind the ashes theyre just evidence of how brightly i can glow and i wanna glow hard like one dim star on an otherwise starless night that shines just to prove its fidelity and i know what you must think of me what hypocrisy but i dont wanna enter prayer reeking of my addictions stinking of cologne i dont want god to smell another man on me mistaking mnage trois for the trinity so so thank god thank god the stars dont judge us for what we do beneath them thank god the stars dont see the evil we commit under their names thank god for the silence for the dimness for nights spent alone thank god for friends who know more than just your bra strap thank god for cab rides home cause tonight im gonna strip the spotlight tonight im gonna turn off frank ocean tonight im gonna take off the stilettos im gonna take off the turquoise rings im gonna take off the lipgloss and im gonna sleep naked not trying to be sexy just trying to be me a girl with a shaved head and with eyes deep enough to stand in with convictions strong enough to stand on im finding the mercy of god right where im standing and its binding its blinding its forgiveness but most of all its mine so so tonight im gonna sit out on the fire escape eating an apple and im gonna nickname the view eden and im gonna look up at those tragic stars with their pagan hearts full of mourning and im gonna say what a fall but what light what impossible light
