with his light the sun she gave reflected back the night the moon was waning almost out of sight softly ocean gypsy calls silence holds the stars a while they smile sadly for her where she falls just

eyes her fingers lifeless stroked the sand her battered soul was lost she was abandoned silken threads like wings still shine wind swept pleasures still make patterns in her lovely hair so dark and

me to pull the likes of you don t bother me don t bother me i ve better things to do the toys all started crying cause that engine was so mean and then there came another one the smallest ever seen

the senses for if we never learned to see it then our mind will never sense it but still i ponder its inner workings head off to church and ask god where my soul is lurkin and if responsive he d probably say the body s just a cockpit and we re all goin down like drunks when they re nauseous but do fixes of substances help us find ourselves act as maps of our conscious es or to the honest is this just an excuse to get high above the lows that we re used to instead of choosing death and i m not afraid of that cause it s all natural like birth but i wonder what was before this debacle before the womb where did kai loom and whom decided who or what body i d bring to the tomb assume we were aloof before life just souls chillin then wanted to get high feelin so we took some shit 28 grams of it then started trippin and this is what the damn trip is a drug induced illusion of movement and we ll wake up soon when death strikes like it s bowlin down the alley and the pins are losin so who s in charge of your mirage what facade do you decide to adopt upon you leaving your garage cause all of us where masks and costumes to try to be apart of some clique or creed that we believe we belong to but so long to it all and it s long overdue i threw my mask away like i do when october s through is your soul so gross that it repulse you donned a mask so the damn world can t assault you some say it s 21 grams but i ll say it s 28 cause souls are bought and sold like coke of the same weight i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness starving hysterical naked angel headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night who were expelled from the academies for crazy and publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull who coward in unshaven rooms in underwear burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the terror through the wall as i sit and ponder livin death smokin cigarettes i wonder if my shit s hot like a summer trip but i m done with it expectations can suck dick that s some punk shit if i cared than my art couldn t function people care too much giving two fucks about thumb suckers opinions when they matter none we are who we are victims of fates hands you re trippin bout race when all our souls are 28 grams love can never do what hate can so hey cool kid hate society and not the man that it made foolish that it made ghoulish we re products of a system but i taught you to resist em so reject your papa s wisdom cause this a new age like your birthday at midnight where knives are at fist fights and truth s insight lacks from most windpipes but we sit tight while women get exploited for the point of sellin shit for coins and dollars and all this honest is darkness that s upon us rights gone cause we fear some terrorists might bomb us well that s fear mongerin used by the news to make us feel scared of somethin when we re 10 years removed cause if it s comin from the people we love then all the sudden their motherfuckin opinion is ours like actors plaster their views when broadcastin then followed by the masses their vote is what we re all castin but the

go the systematic knowledge of the physical world gained through observation and experimentation usually beginning with a hypothesis or what some may call an estimation record your results from a series of tests and what you re left with is a theory at best now let me give my hypothesis an educated guess on why my people on the whole seem to be such a mess genocide the deliberate extermination of a race culture or an entire nation centuries ago they brought us here on a boat enslaved us beat us til our spirit was broke then they gave us freedom and a little bit of hope then they killed our leaders and they gave us dope from the c i a by way of nicaragua shipped to rick ross hes the black godfather now oscar blandn was his known supplier he snitched on rick so that he could retire ratted on ricky so he got out quickly now this is where the situation gets a little sticky not a citizen of the u s a he got released and got hired by the d e a then he got his green card from the i n s but that shouldve never happened due to previous arrests see our government seems to think that there is a difference between powdered cocaine and crack for instance you get five years for five grams of crack but in the powdered form you have a hundred times that now who has the rock and who has the powder whos the oppressed and who has the power they want you to fail so you wind up in jail you know how much they make while you sittin in that cell billions of dollars for inmate facilities you sell yourself back into slavery willingly it s not black and white its so much more its the rich stayin rich and the poor stayin poor the poor whites meth the poor blacks crack its not about race and once you realize that we as a nation are free to move on and become one people a movement strong droppin this science murs is a scientist droppin this science while they drop bombs now black people weren t the first to be enslaved we were just the first to be treated this way no education you were killed if you could read so you hid your intellect if you wanted to succeed and what happens to a lie when you livin it you lose sight of who you are and start forgettin it so many of us to this day act ignorant a mere shadow of our form of magnificence welfare no independence we become victims dependin on the system looking for a handout waiting on some help dwelling on the past feeling sorry for your self but you do what you can to make it out the trap and that right there is the origin of rap it wasn t always played on every radio station it was us makin the best out of a bad situation inner city schools stopped teaching us instruments we took turntables and started flippin it stole electricity from the street lights plugged it into a system and made the beat hype there was a mic but mc s

where it was just a drum and a couple of sounds you had two records you could go back and forth to keep the groove goin cause the break was so short now if that ain t science i don t know what is the ingenuity of these young black kids the bronx new york sedgwick cedar kool herc earth hip hop true believers adversity produces opportunity anythings accomplished through strength and unity the fate

would be delighted to tell you how suave they were at the drop of a hat there was three of em one of them thought she was a beauty queen the other one was a walking blow job and then there was this skinny girl oh well some of the guys in the band got together with the girls from the college they were having a good time we were in albuquerque for a couple of days but these girls thought they were hot shit and wouldn t pooch the guys in the band on the first day so a couple of the guys in the band who were desparate for that kind of action kept working on them for two days which is a waste of fuckin time anyway so anyway but if that s your idea of a good time what the hey send those pants up here here s some more okay good good traditional cotton oh how sweet um huh huh huh huh here work these anyway we re in albuquerque new mexico a couple of the guys in the band who shall go nameless because their girlfriends might find out decided they were gonna work the wall on these girls from the college so one night it was the first night when they were still trying to get it in there ya know what i mean huh huh huh huh the skinny girl she says to one of the guys in the band she says well to several of the guys in the band and one of the t shirt guys too hey let s go skinny dipping at two o clock in the morning at the pool at the hotel that s right your heard right two o clock in the morning pool at the hotel it was so fun but the water was very very cold so they go out there and the girl who was really skinny and probably totally insensitive to climatic changes took all of her garments off and she jumped in the pool and she says hey guys come on in well one of them did the other one was too smart for that shit so him and the t shirt guy say by the edge of the pool and when the girl who was really skinny and insensitive to climatic changes took off her clothes and jumped in the pool she threw her pants over there by the little table well one of the guys in the band picked up her panties he told me later the stuff in the bottom was like punching an eclair anyhow there was nothing else to do it was albuquerque new mexico it s two o clock in the morning they re not going to get any nooky anyway so this one guy and the t shirt guy started sniffing the girl s panties they were sniffing the fudge and sniffing the glue sniffing everything that adhered to these delightful little morsels some of you might think this is weird no wonder it s not exactly normal but what the fuck so they re snorting it hey it s the twentieth century whatever you can do to have a good time let s get on with it so long as it doesn t cause a murder so they re snorting the pants and then they put them on their heads they were having a good time the girl was in the water she didn t even see what was going on with her underpants they were wearing the pants it looked just like a tiny little party hat their ears were sticking out the side it was so fun later on they discovered this would make a great way of life for them they would go from town to town looking for panties they would take the panties after they were hung up on the clothes line later on they would take them back in the dressing room they would play with them they would fetish the underpants they would snort every little morsel attached to the underpants and then they would feel that they were fulfilled
