less about more and more a nigga hates common and think will smith is wack and think club rap has the hottest on the map a black respects people like mos and jill scott and wont put themselves in a position to deal rock a nigga blames white people for slavery a black knows that it was africans who sold blacks into slavery but when its all said and done a nigga wont even care hell just say thats just who he is and that its just a part of him cuz hes a nigga and hes fine being a nigga so when he dies dont trip its just one less

broken and a mind that stays in gloom cus every single love is a piece i have to carry on a back that feels broken in a sleepless january even when the seasons change into freezing rain i won t be afraid cus i m leaving canterbury i walk a path that s been painted with the frozen rain whispers in the wind are still praying that it snows again and even then i m still chasing an emotion when i m searching for some beautiful but saying that i m so content the ghosts pretend and they tell me that i m different tell me i m perfect they tell me i m significant they tell me every single lie they conjure and barter because i am a monster and everyone that i ve ever loved is dead they disappeared and found a better one instead and even though that december sun has set i still read her lips and i remember what it said you re not alone cody you re not alone just stay by my side and you ll see what grace provides i start to relish she s archangellic and when she tells it i can see it s safe to fly into the wind with a murder of crows so i can leave where i ve been with the circle of vul tures to ascend with my personal goals and i can sing to the dead til the surface unfolds first i ll sit and listen to the symphony mix it with my misery and kiss it til my lips will bleed this is me mr bare boned winter who s been tracing footsteps where the scarecrows whisper in a ear discreetly still and calm with philharmonics spoken crystal clear to teach me and when the pistoleers defeat me i ll just evanesce til i disappear completely this is just a monday night puppy love letter to a cherub that s apparent when the things become better if it s an angel with a subtle recoil then i can probably find an rainbow in a puddle of oil when i surrender i watch the stars that illuminate the sky

where i can seek a guide to see that i can reach the bottom with the clocks will switch when the idle pieces ball to fists cuz all of this is just a wish that i could meet the dawn again and i pray

em i planned it it swept in through my window i snatched it and canned it the jar shakes on my table it s power immense i m nervous just to hold it this shit is intense you re just a evil gust of wind the deadly breath to exhale i sentence you to jail let this jar be your hell i ve caught death in a dixie cup tried to get me when i was fucked up gotta get it to a jar anybody got a car i can use because i live too far to park death ain t come here lookin to talk he wanna stalk somebody in the dark so somebody help me help me somebody inside in this cup is worse than them zombies maybe dig a hole leave it inside bury death alive but if i dont get it out of this red cup quick everyone here s gonna die and screwed the lid on tightly but still it tried to fight me everytime you breathe in your last breath it might be now theres more on the hunt daily and nightly death is just a breath x4 and if you catch it you can play with it but don t let it go don t poke no holes in the top don t drop it don t let it go i got death trapped like a rat without the cheese see me play him like a game of chess and win with ease watch as i spread disease with a wave of the hand the plagues that riddle man mine to command can t let him in keep him enclosed in the mason the case in glass it zoom while i consume doomed souls then i laugh can t let it shatter if it does i m gone soon after tortured by the one i ve kept trapped like brain matter  caught death in a mixing bowl with a plate on top like a make shift then i tried movin that shit in a coffee can with a skull that i ve painted off on the side then it got free and i tried to grab him but my hands went through like i m choking a ghost so i turned on the fan and then i grabbed the bag and then i held it wide open it started to blow and it blew inside then i quickly tied that shit in a knot like a pretzel dough and then the bag puffed up like a big balloon and when i looked in his eye it looked just like fog circlin gigglin thick black darkness sick by far and then i pushed the contents of that bag into a mason jar and if you catch you can play with it but don t let it go don t be sharin it take care of it and don t let it go i have a glass pickle jar inside i caught the grim reaper would of used a vase or a vahz but this is cheaper inhale him like some reefer then put you in a sleeper he was tryin to kill me but then i caught him he s a keeper sealed it up with duct tape and wrapped it in a towel buried it in the backyard but still i hear it howl it s beyond something foul evil hear it growl i caught one but there s many more still out there on the prowl breathing it in while sleeping eyes pop open you froze just accept it youre dead eyes slowly they close but now i m in control and kill it i must cause if i drop it and it bust i m dead in the dust and if you catch you can play with it but don t let it go and if you breath it for no reason don t let it

a couple stop signs but luckily for me i didn t see a single cop light i got to the parking lot and stopped at an open spot i look across the street like god damn that girl is smoking hot had light brown curly hair was five six with nice tits a tight round derrire it might sound very square but her presence made my heart jump wearing tight jeans a tiny tee and some dark pumps i should approach but i didn t dare i had to sit and stare i could feel myself getting scared she shot a glare i felt my last bit of courage visit damn it i panicked got frantic and just gave her a whistle so now i m feeling like a real casanova cause i choked on the approach there s no chance that she s glancing over no chance to show her my advanced and lower regions that could leave her feeling dazed and in a trance with slower breathing see i was dreaming about fulfilling fantasies when i snapped to reality and see that she s already leaving there s no good reason for me to even sweat it figured she s out of my leave and it s best that i forget it so i headed down the street to grab a slice of cheese from rusty s made my way to just play to get my fingers dusty spent half an hour checking records in my headphones bought a shadow single and an album by the deftones i left to get home and guess who i saw that same cutie patootie with a bootie and no bra my jaw dropped as saw that i caught her eye and she took a second glance as she walked on by i kept it cool jarred my mind as i thought of lines to let her know that i m original and not some other guy like bonjour tu es la pomme de mes yeux sacrebleu i ve got a sickness and i think that you re the cure she rolled her eyes and away she went i guess that s just my luck she don t speak french i said that pretty face don t match that ugly attitude it s obvious i think you re cute so you should show some gratitude she turned around and looked like i ain t mad at you that line gets them every time i knew that s all i had to do i smiled polity as i shook her hand lightly rethinking my thoughts on love at first sight worried it might be a light breeze picked up her scent and got the best of me i asked her for her name she promptly responded with destiny well destiny that s ironic cause this is fate my name is lee and i can t wait to rub your feet after our date she said wait you re kind of confident i said no i m cocky but give

instance the bird will be played by the flute here s the duck played by the oboe the cat by the clarinet the bassoon will represent grandfather the wolf by the french horns and peter by the strings the blast of the hunters shotguns played by the kettle drums are you sitting comfortably then i shall begin early one morning peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow on a branch of a big tree sat a little bird peter s friend all is quiet all is quiet chirped the bird gaily yes all is quiet just then a duck came waddling round she was glad that peter hadn t closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow seeing the duck the little bird flew down upon on the grass settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders what kind of bird are you if you can t fly said he to this the duck replied what kind of bird are you if you can t swim and dived into the pond they argued and argued the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore suddenly something caught peter s attention it was a cat crawling through the grass the cat thought the bird is busy arguing i ll just grab him stealthily she crept towards him on his velvet paws look out shouted peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree while the duck quacked at the cat from the middle of the pond the cat walked around the tree and thought is it worth climbing up so high by the time i get there the bird will have flown away just then grandfather came out he was angry because peter had gone in the meadow it is the dangerous place if a wolf should come out of the forest then what would you do but peter paid no attention to his grandfather s words boys like peter aren t afraid of wolves but grandfather took peter by the hand locked the gate and led him home no sooner had peter gone than a big gray wolf came out of the forest in a twinkling the cat climbed up into the tree the duck quacked and in her excitement jumped out of the pond but no matter how hard the duck tried to run she couldn t escape the wolf he was getting nearer nearer catching up with her then he got her and with one gulp swallowed her and now this is how things stood the cat was sitting on one branch the bird on another not too close to the cat and the wolf walked round and round the tree looking at them with hungry eyes in the meantime peter without the slightest fear stood behind the gate watching all that was going on he ran home got a strong rope and climbed up the high stone wall one of the branches of the tree around which the wolf was walking stretched out over the wall grabbing hold of the branch peter lightly climbed over on to the tree peter said to the bird fly down and circle over the wolf s head only take care that he doesn t catch you the bird almost touched the wolf s head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him this side and that how that bird teased the wolf and how the wolf wanted to catch him but the bird was clever and the wolf simply couldn t do anything about it meanwhile peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and down and down caught the wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might feeling himself caught the wolf began to jump wildly trying to get loose but peter tied the other end of rope to the tree and the wolf s jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter just then the hunters came out of the woods following the wolf s trail and shooting as they went but peter sitting in the tree said don t shoot birdie and i have already caught the wolf now help us take him to the zoo now just imagine just imagine the triumphant procession peter at the head after him the hunters leading the wolf and winding up the whole procession grandfather and the cat grandfather shook his head discontentedly well if peter hadn t caught the wolf what then above them flew birdie chirping merrily my what brave fellows we are peter and i look what we have caught and if one would listen very carefully he would hear the duck quacking inside the wolf because the wolf in his hurry had swallowed her

tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat there was screaming sounds inside the barn there was laughing sounds out on the street then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain and they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain the reason that they killed him there and i m sure it ain t no lie was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die and then to stop the united states of yelling for a trial two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor emmett till but on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime and so this trial was a mockery but nobody there seemed to mind i saw the morning papers but i could not bear to see the smiling brothers walking down the courthouse stairs for the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free while emmett s body floats the foam of a jim crow southern sea if you can t speak out against this kind of thing a crime that s so unjust your eyes are filled with dead men s dirt your mind is filled with dust your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains and your blood it must refuse to flow for you to let this human race fall down so god
