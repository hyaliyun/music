you the crazed infatuation with blackness the trash that gets viewed and the fact that the tube only showed blacks acting the fool and i was watching and it s sad cause that naturally do sort of condition your mind and over time that s what s attractive to you so young blacks don t see themselves in scholastic pursuits or the more practical routes it s making tracks or it s hoops or god forbid moving packs for the loot shoot even with this music we so limited it s rap or produce and that narrow conception of what s black isn t true of course still we feel forced to adapt to this view like there s something that we re having to prove now add that to the slew of justifications the capitalists use for the new blaxploitation many actions excused in the name of getting cash that s adversely impacting our youth with mental slavery the shackles is loose and it s hard to cut chains when they attached at the roots so what the new black activists do for our freedom is just being them do what you re passionate to not confined by a sense that you have to disprove any stereotypes so called facts to refute or match any image of blackness they ve established as true perhaps we ll

red this is the land of the senecas keep out and then beast master said we should not do this now huh no we should turn around no we should not do this now huh no we should turn around make some plans then come back and attack we went to school and we told the gang we all met up the next saturday armed to the team with bb guns rambo knives and machetes we were a wicked little team we marched beside

know that this war has begun we said you got no rights to post that kind of sign this woods does not belong to you or anyone and your warnings don t scare us because we move silently we hide in the shadows of the trees and we will not be seen we can disarm the traps just set set our own that you will trip our arrows will fly straighter this woods does not belong to anyone but if it must it will

castle but it was where they made the cement at to us it was such a magic place we made a temple out of wood and we filled it with the bones that we found in the woods so people would leave us alone we were young we were dumb we were having so much fun the new kings of a new kingdom we enjoyed our victory we got a message from some one named gypsy he said your bones do not scare me this war s not over and i think that we should meet the temple this friday at 3 i woke up early before school and i ran back to the spot it was filled with traps just like i thought i tore them up and left a note and said is this some kind of joke there s much more to us than just old bones and the top of the castle is where we would meet next this time the time and the place were things that we picked we said no weapons we said no tricks we did the best to hide the fact that we were just some little kids we were just some little kids i was scared when i saw him he looked much older and i thought that he might be a vet beast master climbed the wall and saw he had a rifle hidden on a rope hanging in the pit we said no weapons and we called him out on it he didn t know how i could know until he turned around beast master had climbed up right behind him and didn t make a sound and we really had him now we talked for a while with this stranger about the natives of this land our gangs and nature we got home again we didn t know what to think of him but it seemed like the war was over and the trees held no more danger i was sad to see it go a few days later i ran in to him alone at the place that used to be his old gang s base he told me stories of their glory days before his friends grew up or they moved away and we decided that day that we would build something new we would build it together it would represent our truce and as i got to know him it got easy to see that he was just a kid who loved the woods like me he was a friend he was not an enemy we made our enemies our friends we

world obscured as it was by great clouds here they played out their peaceful lives innocent of the litany of excess and violence that was growing in the world below to live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called monkey was enough then one day strangefolk arrived in the town they came in camouflage hidden behind dark glasses but no one noticed them they only saw shadows you see without the truth of the eyes the happyfolk were blind falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes waiting for the sunset to come people going home jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head now everybody dancing the dance of the dead the dance of the dead the dance of the dead in time the strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty by chance they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest the strangefolk they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things and soon they began to mine the mountain its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world meanwhile down in the town the happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls every day people would wake and stare at the mountain why was it bringing darkness into their lives and as the strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain holes began to appear bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey for the first time the happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the monkey would stir from its deep sleep and then came a sound distant at first it grew into castrophany so immense that it could be heard far away in space there were no screams there was no time the mountain called monkey had spoken there was only fire and then nothing  oh little town in the usa your time has come to see there s nothing you believe you want but where were you when it all came down on me did you call me

paperwork with shaky hands seeing little children stricken with a certain sickness clutch my baby a little tighter reflect the nervous feelings a whole hour passed we starting to lose patience humbled by the thoughts of patients lost in this situation here comes a nurse not knowing that we should fear the worst see the doctors mouth moving couldnt even hear the words this isnt happening to you im

could remove this neuroblastoma tumor from your adrenal glands why you why now it didnt feel fair your grandma shed tears you lost your hair its unbelievable little bella was that strong and inconceivable we lived in the hospital that long protecting your immune system from contaminants you had to wear a medical mask cant give my kid a kiss i learned to envision your face growing getting

to doctor and not epstein i remember the cries remember the meals fed through tubes pulling the red wagon the sound of the plastic wheels kind of a metaphor for pulling through this ordeal i pray my enemies never even have to know how this feels but forget our feelings doesnt matter youre the one suffering you couldnt speak a lot yet but its like your eyes was saying daddy if its an obstacle and price i got to pay for a long great life then well make it through okay the day of your final surgery i still live in that moment the teddy bear you were holding i still own it i watched the doors closing february 2 2004 my little girl is cured hi daddy this is me bella i love you sooooo much happy fathers day i will take my life right now if you would save my child ill exchange my life for

screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed but not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died and there i stood alone and afraid i dropped to my knees and there i prayed and i promised him everything i could give if only he would make the music live and he promised it would live once more but this time one would equal four and in five years four had come to mourn and the music was reborn and they were singin bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to
