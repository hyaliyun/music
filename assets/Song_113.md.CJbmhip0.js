never be fully informed on some things just like i will never understand who really buys moonpies or those rolling wrinkled dried up sausages but then again she s been here a lot longer than me she s seen everything from men who grow dread locks out of their top lips to children who look like cigarettes i give her my money i wait for my change but i feel like there s something more happening here

she had to go because he friends were in hunger but she said she d be in town untill the end of the summer damn i said damn cause it s serious my mind froze cause of what it just experienced my heart is jumping all around in my chest and because of this girl now my life is the best so went home to see what the calender reads the end of the summer i only got ten weeks the thought of this girl ain t escaping my mind here goes to ten weeks for just making her mine i did what i could just for being around her i could tell by her smile i just knew we were bound to be when i sent her flowers on her birthday the opportune time to ask her out on our first date she couldn t think of anything more she would like than to spend the day with me on the fourth of july as magic would have it as the fireworks bursted underneath the stars is where we shared our first kiss it was magic i could really feel the chemistry looked in her eyes and i could tell that we were meant to be end of the night i couldn t let her depart and after that day we were never apart was lost to cloud nine only lovers could reach and i m high enough to bring you up to heaven with me we shared good times like the birds and the bees and remember how we spent a summer beneath the trees in love head over heels i ve done lost my mind it was the end of the road time to walk the line living and laughing together in love in ways no one else could do this better than us summer nights your loving embrace became a warm coat as soon as the fall breeze came when it did we had to hault like a freeze frame we knew it was the end when the colors of the leaves changed together forever was never an option remember the days but it s better to box them inside held close like a tattoo from the start we both knew that we had to continue on cause we know it s for the best but we re gonna be together in this life or the next so in my thoughts when i sleep in the night will forever remain the best weeks of my

tend to greater tenderness i m gathered in and tempted by your tenderness hidden by the roadside flying by this thorny rose i m told to let it all unfold inside this heart but wasn t told how sharp the thorns would pierce my heart when blue was spoken and though i may feel tender still to thorns i shall surrender by the cloaked and shapes i will mistake for stories made at my own expense and often and in the night my eyes take on the thick of it the cyclone screaming wind of it the drowning in the wave of it the keep my breath above of it to breathe with all the heart of it to breathe with all my heart so gentle i am calling gentle i do summon all your being gentle so you can hold all of the folds of all these parts that become sore when waves crash shorelines to this heart and

everyone i am the scarecrow alone and disconnected you stare right past me undetected i am only here when you expect it nowhere man i live invisible and feel a sadness undescribable i hang emotionless holding a bible no revival i died and became apathy then married vacancy then moved my children to the tundra of complacency i do not exist in your world i ve burned the bridges i have cut the life line now all i have left is my mind which judges all of you analyzes all your dumb philosophies in wonderment of how you all have ruined your ecology yet you do not hear for i am to you only but nothingness and i can t understand why i m the only one that feels like this it s all piss i flee out of all the people that have left me the one i miss most is me i am the scarecrow and i am so alone and i ve seen thirty years of down time the face of a clown a stick for a spine from a grandiose small town mind and crows fly all around mine they shit on my shoulder i got no voice no mobility i get older heated but colder no yield in my field fuck my opinion i stare at your houses in the distance silent persistence at night your windows glisten i got nothing to say cause no one would listen anyway so i remain against the grain i ve seen sunny days with rain busted knuckles in pain and never complained dirt is my domain my view is plain but i m invisible sounds mystical not really the days are dry the evening chilly the only person that understands is little billy when he s lonely let me feel something make me worth a damn make me new again make me a fuckin man i ve seen the rise and fall the come and go the high and low and if you knew what i know sometimes one does not reap what he sews the wind blows the moon glows the water flows the rain turns to snow and the ground is froze and only god knows why that s the way it goes i am the scarecrow and i am so alone i m so alone i am the scarecrow and i am so alone i m so alone so alone i am so alone so

the part i had together with my friend absence makes the heart grow fonder of the time before the absence and the nights spent trying to imagine when you played i was blinded by the magic you displayed i tried to reenact it in a way i need the dark today to see the stars decay cause if i can fall asleep then i can dream we are awake another shot of jameson and pbr to chase another conversation in a seedy bar to play right man this side of me s the worst when i m terrified that all i ll leave s a dynasty of dirt but you believed in me and i believed your words so in turn i

you showed i miss my confidant and honest talks allotted on the phone with you mike i wish that i could hug you again it s getting harder to pretend and i can t undo what s been thanks for being

want to admit that you yourself are not an individual and are just part of a wholemovement of ideas and thought and culture and humanity and furthermore the universe and everything unless you really

it finally dawned to me that i was something to somebody but nothing better than property properly embrace the game its a celebrity but honestly all i wanted out of life was a life that taunted me it kept dangling dollar bills off fishing poles or driving a family sedan acrylic illustrations that i got hooked but like i d go back to that cracked aquarium i so naturally referred to as a debilitated concentration camp disguised in a nursing home sense of fashion i d fasten my home and if i were because sooner or later they re coming to conquer you they been monitoring your moves so please make a promise that you re honoring the truth the heat makes me breathe less it s time to bleed dreams so the seams seem refreshed and i no longer feel the need to be what you think is best don t worry you will die unimpressed born ahead of my time i never relied on a promise with development of the mind comes instinct conscience i think things will be better when i travel further but for now i struggle

dark as can be but with the faith of a star i took a giant quantum leap and erased the mark of the beast the fangs the flaws i took out didn t phase my force field so i pulled the eyelids over the head and blinked until my eyes peeled i deal with an ideal of silence and self medications to resist distractions because attractions lead to all attachments and i m going through withdrawal i made my way to a cave maybe i made a mistake because company never came close to inflicting their morphing identity processed dissected orange forms swarm the sunset that sinks beyond the endless horizon i fade i made a sacrifice i m hollowed out empty in an after life where i exist in a hole in a cell in the head of a god but there s nothing to sell now because all i found was a book that i can t read because the story teller is hooked in a thread we ve weaved into a net this light has a life of its own with a sweet and mystery completely meant to me the needs of shadow corners and indeed it s starting to get to me i m sort of tipping onto one side it s getting windy outside and i know because the inside is dizzy and i m spinning around tripping over my expectations and hitting the ground pitiful attempts to prevent this pretty from leaving the egg before the hatch i seem to be bleeding back into the sleepy beings whom a translucent vein that runs deeper than the roots of meaning soaked in laughing gas half awake that s how you ll find me putting on my happy face asking god why are you crying why why are you crying why you crying it doesn t make sense i was born inside an open letter to be read and the message says i m not dead alive and breathing kicking bleeding within so if you cut my skin you will get a slice of heaven show and tell hold me now close to you and notice who i am one man s standing outside in the rain storm letting water drain down to feed my veins now i m not thirsty anymore please world don t hurt me anymore when the deserted feel the dreams that seems to be split at the seams and with a manage to bake more cake with a first footsteps then the gutter away from mother so pray for sunny away from home thunder rolls lightning might strike twice

and for all his animal friends his friends said he was murdered for his pelt by a man in a mustache from the south he had a cigarette in his hand with his back turned to the hurricanes winds and the coyotes family said he was a hunter and a gatherer and a father and a friend and a good one at that and the leader of the pack said that this coyote will never come back but may he rest in peace from this desert heat and the coyote was somewhere else looking down on this desert town he let out his howl","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"when i was born they said i could have died my father did weep and my mother she cried although my lungs were withered inside a two pound boy was alive many months later i was taken home to a nice little house where i mended my bones i would sit in the tree that once bordered the road watch the world as it turned so slow once i was seven we packed up our things and moved to pa where the setting sun brings the beauty of life to the valleys and springs and the sound of the partridge does ring as i grew older my life doubled in size the tops of the hills arched their backs towards the skies cause nature you know does sink and does rise like the ocean so old and so wise i remember when i played my first show the music pulsated with those in the front row spring claimed the air as the clouds hung so low in a year a year or so sometimes when i lie awake late at night i watch the shadows that trickle from the house light the patterns move slow like those born without sight when you sleep you life seems so bright now that ive grown up ill soon leave my home and pack up the pictures of the ones i did know ill never forget all the places i roamed pennsylvania the love you have shown i do not know if god is real or a lie but oh well i thank god im
