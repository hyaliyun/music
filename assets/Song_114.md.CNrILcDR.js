blows aerodynamically this girl was a mess otto eye balled the diva lying comatose amongst the reeds and he suddenly felt the fire of inspiration flood his soul he ran back to his workshop where he futzed and futzed and futzed for otto titsling had found his quest to lift and mold the female breast to point the small ones to the sky to keep the big ones high and dry every night he d sweat and snort searching for the right support he tried some string and paper clips hey he even tried his own two lips well he stitched and he slaved he slaved and he stitched until finally one night in the wee hours of morning otto arose from his workbench triumphant yes he had invented the world s first over the shoulder boulder holder hooray exhausted but ecstatic otto ran out to the diva bearing the prototype in his hot little hand now the diva did not wanna try the darn thing on but after many initial mishaps she finally did and the sigh of relief that issued forth from her mouth was so loud that it was mistaken by some to be the early onset of the seraken winds which would often roll through the schwarzwald with a vengeance ahhhhh but little did otto know at the moment of his greatest triumph lurking under the diva s bed was none other than the very worst of the french patent thieves phillip debrassiere and phil was watching the scene with a great deal of interest later that night while the brunhilda slept into the wardrobe phillip softly crept he fumbled through knickers and corsets galore till he found otto s titsling and he ran out the door crying oh my god what joy what bliss i m gonna make me a million from this every woman in the world will wanna buy one i will have all the goods manufactured in taiwan the result of this swindle is pointedly clear do you buy a

stain on a tricolour and a culture a little too high for an english boy like me she doesn t know the island i grew up upon the valleys and the hills that i ve roamed along and she doesn t like my clothes and she doesn t like my songs but she s still my mademoiselle and it goes to show you never can tell cos she was a quiet one she was a shy one she was the prettiest at the show she crept up so slowly she crept up behind me but still she pretended that she didn t know but oh then she fixed me and then she kissed me and she s yet to let me go and though i m far away across the sea i m singing for the hope that she would ever remember me  so honey when you re lonely on the road and you re all on your own hanging out sad at the back of the country show picture me there with my hat down low a

beautiful woman i gazed on the forest and burned out the sahara desert with a packet of goat s meat and a change of clothes i crossed it in two hours i am a gazelle so swift so swift you can t catch

we sailed on a soft summer day i turned myself into myself and was jesus men intone my loving name all praises all praises i am the one who would save i sowed diamonds in my back yard my bowels deliver uranium the filings from my fingernails are semi precious jewels on a trip north i caught a cold and blew my nose giving oil to the arab world i am so hip even my errors are correct i sailed west to reach east and had to round off the earth as i went the hair from my head thinned and gold was laid across three continents i am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal i cannot be

look back dont get shook dont crack dont act so took dont tack another sorry on time is gone for that just go maybe cause the time was wrong up in the head but the hearts a strong one thats what i

past discretions but we live and learn that history and past are lessons the day this is work the love of it dies a handful make it the others will strive and hunger can drive hatred but such is just life i guess jealousy s the curse that the struggle inspires these critics seek to break and divide i know i m bitter but my faith is divine take it in stride yeah i act like i hate it at times but i found love through this music and a place to reside for every friend i have an eager opponent for every cent i spent on meagre components i gave something back so i don t feel the need for atonement cause we all get our hands dirty when we re seizing the moment and we always took the lead peers would follow and paid for everything that we cleared or borrowed if my son can benefit from what you see here my sorrow s justified just that i might not be here tomorrow when it rains it pours when you re soaked and the world tries to fuck with ya trust in ya own and yourself my biggest fear s to die not knowing you well and i ain t afraid to die i m afraid of going to hell oh lord oh lord oh lord oh lord this will be my last confession liberty can leave harsh impressions i have little faith forgive me for my past discretions but we live and learn that history and past are lessons i ve always played the hand i was given no exceptions here humanity s driven you see all men are born equal just the standard of living that differs between the jewish adriatic and christian i m a logical man given to science forgive me i know religion inspires but too many have government and political ties and use state of the art warfare to bridge their divides there s hate crime wars on daytime talks and rape trials walk in state wide courts we don t pray no more we only break thy laws so what this world don t give us we gon take by force assertion aggression s murder then vengeance we treat peace like it s a term of acceptance exception we re not accepting if we re searching for penance and so these words are for my son so he can learn from my lessons  when it rains it pours when you re soaked and the world tries to fuck with ya trust in ya own and yourself my biggest fear s to die

is spilt o my dear kinsman prince as thou art true for blood of ours shed blood of montague o cousin cousin prince benvolio who began this bloody fray benvolio tybalt here slain whom romeo s hand did slay romeo that spoke him fair bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urged withal your high displeasure all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bow d could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio s breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertain d revenge and to t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly this is the truth or let benvolio die lady capulet he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life i beg for justice which thou prince must give romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live prince romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe montague not romeo prince he was mercutio s friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt prince and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hate s proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie a bleeding but i ll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses therefore use

animals hiding in a glass house and i cant let them out or even let them change somehow but thats all i can tell you now cause im not ready to tell you everything i want you to know but im ready to trust you or at least im ready to let love show cause i spent the last few years chasing my desires then i found out i was just chasing my own demons when i found desire in you you called my words excuses but i just thought of them as poorly stated reasons simple execution of neglect and preparation for something hidden in a deeply rooted promise that i ll always speak my mind but sometimes my mind will be mistaken cause me and my friends were not the type of people to leave room for error but i make enough errors to leave an empty room in my heart and with no one to turn the lights on my heart lives in the dark and i will hide the light until you ask for it to ignite because the truth is bright but hidden in plain sight deep within the dark pools of your eyes the deep secrets cold as ice but sharp as a knife that feeling of real vibes hidden deep inside my dark feeling that im just depression s trophy wife a sight to exemplify surviving the night cause me and my friends we never get in trouble but we are a troubled bunch hope lies within our potential deep within the rubble hoping that light will touch a hypocritical statement a blatant placement of words that only have purpose if you strike a match and ignite them and there you go we solved the problem for darkness but reinstated a purpose of hatred within the deep desires we developed to envelope the cyclical deep desires of desiring deep connections to add depth to the thick skin of our emptiness questioning representing messages of necessary self fulfillment some are satisfied with their instinct to survive through the storm of darkness others call it selfishness but me and my friends we dont subscribe to the cloud of confusion found in questioning what turns the lights on no we never asked cause me and my friends we see the light on and celebrate regardless but sometimes the light doesnt matter when we wear a mask so what is gained if this isnt me its like having lungs but no ability to breathe i guess the light exposed the fact that acceptance became a dead end and its the only conclusion i can see cause someday maybe the identity of me and my friends will just be me but with this mask it doesnt matter how bright the lights are cause i dont know who i am i dont know who i am unless its me and my friends","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"all i want is to talk to you all i want is to talk to

the blue light of the moon we didn t talk and silently we both felt powerful and like the moon my chest was full because we both knew we re just floating in space over molten rock and we felt safe and

undone written by anam sufi read by david tennant here is the truth exactly how i remember it and perhaps in being so it is inevitably undone here when the hour is late and the bottle long gone where thoughts like constellations blur in and out of focus nothing more than buoyant memories aqueous melancholy the shoreline recedes into darkness betraying grains of the past they catch light of the moon giving song and sparkle to this late night tale heres the truth i swear word for word picking through a pile of sedimentary emotion the crackle of fire the cold in my bones and the pitter patter of rain takes me back echoes of footfalls crushing fallen leaves all thats left of the yellow wood racing back in time back to where it all started the beginning of the end wed set up camp between risk and consequence reckless in a way that only youth can know our hearts a cursor pulsing eager to forge the story of our lives there was no such thing as a photo without flash a song without bass or too much faith in the future little did we know what happened over what is felt is of little consequence the sheer impact of remaining impervious to desire you to me a hem caught by a hook in time inexplicably attached like the deadweight subscription of newspapers in a digital world of click stories and shot glass love affairs the orchestra of our past carries on listlessly erratic yet somehow segued like time and all of our choices embalmed incubate the senses the smell of your skin the sound of your breath the question mark curve in your ear now these seem hollow like the nape of your neck where once i touched and felt you alas remember the end outside the admiral i inhaled i exhaled reflecting i didnt notice you arrive but you stood there alongside me as the rain fell down i dont think this was a good idea i said lying you shuffled your weight on both feet and i knew you wanted to say something i didnt let you and you disappeared like mist suspended in sight betrayed by my grasp how i wish id run after you and said hold me like you would a photograph from the edges and lightly because anything more and id be stained sullied by the desire of what would always and

them claiming its the white religion scarred by slavery and all the whites that did it but slave owners just manipulated bible scriptures they claimed christian but never obeyed the writings in it they stumble off the imagery provided by the pictures like why when i look at god he looks nothing like this you right and that description is not provided by the scriptures and folks will be held accountable when christ arrives to get us and for you i m just trying to help you make the right decision there s only one god ain t no black or white religion the devil used slavery to magnify division now you trapped inside the prison of a past you not forgiving forgive them cause we done felt a lot of pain so lord i know you feel us and we done seen alot of things so my prayer is that you heal us these scars they run so deep so deep these scars they run so deep so deep some of them know some been listening to liars though some of them just don t care some of them trying though without faith in you what do they rely upon to keep them righteous on the same street that guys are dying on doctrine of the devils survival of the fittest cause all i see it meaning is survival of the wicked it s like you play a game and somebody starts cheating you you feel the only way to beat them is to become a cheater too they call it being tough its really being weak switching teams out of fear that

america slavery is the only past were given searching for a history that reaches past the masters whippings dissing the bible not knowing how many blacks was in it so they revert to egypt we know that they were black so moses had to be to fit in when the brought that baby back joseph blended in so well his fam ain t recognize him so how you think mary took jesus up to eygpt to hide him and honestly back then there wasn t even such a race as black it wasn t until way later we started claiming that i can pick the bible up and show you everything that s black the problem is you should praise him without me even saying that worship the lord who did what you could not do cause you were made in is his image not cause he looks like you i m saying i understand why you feel how you feel but feeling don t always tell you what s real he is the truth and the way and the life homie cause we done felt a lot of pain so lord i know you feel us and we done seen alot of things so my prayer is that you

to but you couldnt tell a thing was off on the surface and i didnt know she was sick until i heard about her service she was born with a heart defect used to the cold knife shed been in and out of hospitals her whole life she knew the whole time and never said why she felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high the nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis though i know its crime to twist her life to fit my own devices whys it so hard to mourn and then try to learn by this but lights that burn shortest are the lights that burn brightest a heart breaking sounds like
