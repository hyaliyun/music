to be yes although not everywhere not by everybody and not in all contexts black music scholars will always use the term because it holds a gravitas within academia because of the terms historical heritage in the us the terms urban contemporary and african american music have generally replaced black music amongst the people and media publications but the story is different in europe reporting for blog the root cord jefferson explained his shock at seeing a photo of a black music section in a german music shop particularly because groups featuring white musicians also featured on the shelves he claimed that the picture raised questions about racial politics and the reach of history but the most important question was if three white jewish guys making speed punk can fit under the umbrella of black music then isn t that umbrella too big as expressed throughout the previous chapters black music as a moniker for stylistic innovation has been used as a marketing tool for decades embedded within that is the implicit notion of natural talent or a natural rhythm which some white musicians have appropriated eric claptons racial diatribe about jimi hendrix being a classic example in 1996 the music of black origin awards were established kanya king mbe to recognise the outstanding achievements of artists who perform music in genres ranging from gospel jazz rnb soul reggae to hip hop since inception the mobos have been the most influential movement for black music heritage in britain a place that doesnt have the same sort of historical longevity in the subject nevertheless over the past few years with many white musicians received nominations and going on to win awards questions have been asked about the name music of black origin if a white artist can win it interestingly on the mobo website the terms urban music and black music are used together but in slightly different contexts mobo being europes leading urban music brand while it has also played an instrumental role in elevating black music and culture to mainstream popular status in the uk the term black music is only used once on the website in relation to its status in the uk while urban music is used seven times to describe its reputation in europe and the rest of the world which may appease some of those questioning the brands multiracial contradictions a genre currently under racial scrutiny by some black musicians is jazz in 2000 a jazz trumpeter called nicholas payton went on a lengthy but scattered poetic rant on his blog about why jazz wasnt cool anymore one of the key points he discussed was how jazz had died in 1959 and it was now just a marketing ploy just last year pianist orrin evans no longer described his music as jazz but instead black american music he had featured at a black american music conference and while his input was minimal the general tone of the event was that of jazz being a racist term willard jenkins went a step further by concluding that there was still an issue of racism within jazz unfortunately the stigma towards the word and the racism imposed upon both the name and genre wasnt misguided jazz did not have a good reputation amongst white critics as they deemed it plagiarism and mutilation of classical white composers but this has since changed as more white jazz composers became prominent within the genre in the early days jazz was often called devil music possibly attributed to the deep seated links with classical music and religious context in spite of this african american music has come to represent liberation emotional

which is a lot and no i m not about to stop because i m takin it to the top a whole lot of people rap but what good is that if the rap that they re rappin is way off track i don t mean to attack you but i m cuttin no slack to those people that i hear saying meaningless raps in actuality i mean in reality the words that you use are a mere formality vocabulary is not what it s about the point that you re tryin to get across is what counts cause when a lot of rappers rap they try to use big words but that s the most absurd thing i ve ever heard of they think that that s impressive but when will they learn their lesson that it s not the words that count it s the message they get a lot of big words out of some magazine and nine times out of ten they don t even know what they mean they stand up on the stage huffin and puffin rappin for nearly an hour but they re not sayin nothin really but a lot of jibberish and i know that they all wish they had access to fresh rhymes like this i came to rock and shock and give my all which is a lot and no i m not about to stop because i m takin it to the top fresh rhymes and a razzamatazz smooth power and grace and mucho pizzazz good looks and charm and personality you punch it in your calculator and it adds up to me i know the same goes for the rest of my crew my deejay jazzy jeff and ready rock c too the ultimate combination of strenght and prestige my crew holds the key to fun and everything you need to party all night yes it s you we will excite the time is right so don t fight it suckers please don t bite it we came to rock and shock and give our all which is a lot and no we re not about to stop because we re takin it to the top i really hate to brag about him but when people doubt him i have to stand up and tell the whole world all about him united we stand divided we fall is the moto of our crew and it s honored by all of us we pledge allegiance to the work we rehearse and it enables us always to come out first we came to rock and shock and give our all which is a lot yo jeff man why don t you take it to the top  we succeed everytime we attempt to rock the house you ve got to dance cause no one is exempt from the rules set forth by us of course you know stay out our way or behold the brute force of me jeff and ready rock c we re a trio oh you didn t know that means that there s three of us one for all and all for one and we re takin it to the top before we get done i m inclined to rhyme anytime you ll find it ain t a rapper with a mind as impressive as mine i insist on a rise and i despise a decline on the day i descend that s the day i resign i m creatin my trends and innovatin my rap why is that i don t know i guess i got it like that my personality extends beyond the realm of mediocre my advice for life is if you want somethin go for it cause there s nothin that s beyond your grasp just set your mind to it work hard and you can have anything that you want the sky is the limit stop lunchin around get up and go get it cause i came a long way from the past till today now i m never slowin down ah ah no way i came to rock and shock and give my all which is a lot and no i m not about to stop because i

don t shatter the blast falls off my neighbour s wall my phone rings of the hook with complaint phone calls but i just let it ring and i don t go near it i turn the volume up so that i can t hear it

plot a sample jeff and about me and my dj rocks i m not listening to reason so don t try to talk do yourself a favour and take a walk or i ll amputate your mic and repossess your core i m the man salute to the prince the power lord my friends i ll mangle you if we tangle put my arms in your asophogus and i ll strangle you i m the messiah or rhymes the verbal gladiator i m like a bomb and my

battle field i m invincible you want a battle me man be sensible i ll never submit to any other emcee be a duel to the death either him or me and as i verbalise to my dj s cut if we kill a wack crew or two so what we just rock it we just rock it dj jeff break 2 on each occasion that i perform the force captures my body like a magical storm suddenly i m rendered helpless in a state of shock but it is rather abrupt when i start to rock adrenalin rushes my ego swells and the yells of the crowd make my hype excel my metabolism quickens my body gets sense that s when i metamorphosise into the royal fresh prince and as i display all my lyrical beauty you become a slave as your hype increases and as i vocalise i can see it in your eyes you stand up as your enthusiasm levels rise higher and higher beyond the mark of red you scream oh my to what the prince just said as my energy is drained from being so crushed all of a sudden i get another adrenalin rush it happens each and everytime that my dj spins more commonly known as my second wind the spotlights are beaming you are screaming from my body all the sweat is streaming commanding the stage and perpetually frayed giving my all to the pulse of one hundred percent everytime i rhyme when i step off the stage that s when the stop and that has been the account of the evenings events reporting to you live by me the fresh prince i m the latest

cruise it said sunny skies and romantic nights on an incredible ship and i got hype it said it s like the love boat baskin in the sun promisin fun for you and for everyone i said that s dope baby you re down she said yeah we could leave right now the very next day i put the check in the mail and one week later we were ready to sail the brochure said that the boat was large but it was nothin but a broken down barnacle barge and if it wasn t for my girlfriend i wouldn ta went because the captain was a cross eyed hunchback with a limp the cruise was paid for and the food was free so i said what the hell and set out to sea it didn t take long to notice something was wrong the ship was a mess and we were the only ones on it i didn t wanna panic so i chilled for a while till the captain pulled up to what we thought was a deserted isle we looked on to the beach and almost went bezerk we saw 300 natives with spears and grass skirts the said hung a dung a digi dung da doa i said hey baby i guess that means get off the boat their chief said they needed a human sacrifice i said well just take my girl he he psyche i was jokin but things got serious their leader came out and he was curious he got in my face and his breath was the worst i said hey baby you got some mints in your purse his breath was stinkin with filthy brown teeth and two big crusty ashy hairy feet the worst thing he had no toenails on his toes and a big pterodactyl bird bone in his nose i tried to reason with him he wasn t with it he said tenga shanko that meant forget it he said gunga shang tang da bong da boo that meant tonight we re having fresh prince stew then i saw it no it s not the big indiana jones people cooking pot i wanted to fight em but there was no way to beat em i thought to myself where s tarzan when you need him just as they were contemplatin cookin us up we had a major struck of luck a navy ship pulled up the troops came off and they got us out of the pot and i said to the chief yo i get witcha hops the guy that rescued us said i hate to tell you the captain of your ship he had just escaped from bellevue we ve been following him and finally we caught him we re sorry there s no way

got my heart up to speak but she dissed me and dismissed me with a smack on my cheek so i bought six bottles of new fancy cologne but all i got from theresa was i bought new clothes to wear everyplace but all theresa would say was so i gave up this quest for theresa but then on the day my record was released a strange thing happened when it came on the radio theresa broke her neck just to say i looked at her i said you must be foolish why did you ignore me on the way to school if you were interested she said i looked deep into her dark brown eyes i said you ignored me for months on and now

wanted to be a rap artist i would give my all and work my hardest but when i took my song to a record producer he told me that i better go drink some rap juice or something cause my song was really absurd he said that it was the worst trash that he d ever heard you know my ego was shattered he busted my groove i could hear him crackin up as i left the booth i thought my song was good but he busted my bubble the title was girls ain t nothing but trouble luckily i found someone who had faith he lifted my ego back up into place his name was dana goodman and he thought my song was on track so two weeks later it was out on wax it busted up the charts like a hydrogene bomb up up up up it clim clim climbed i made people eat the words that said i couldn t achieve now they had no choice but to believe in me then no sooner than my record came out that same old producer started callin my house one night he called me bout at half past 12 he said i ve got some cash if you wanna sell i said

move that is smart but instead you keep lookin where you know you didn t park searchin for reasons like maybe tickets you owed something to justify that maybe it got towed but not stolen n never forget it but then you ask yourself well where the hell is it if there was a prize you d win dummy of the year cause you re lookin somewhere else when you know you parked it here so through never neverland you find yourself strollin then when you finally accept that it s stolen you call the police and they come and say as if that s somethin that he really needed to mention then they start askin you real dumb questions like you idiot right before they stole it now you re mad this cop is talkin to you and somebody in your car headed to kalamazoo officer fool or whoever you are would you

get beat up by a girl and when my homeboys came they didn t let me explain they said prince you re a sucker you should be ashamed my pride was busted right along with my eye cause my homeboys didn t realize that this girl was a guy and in retrospect i had to laugh i can t believe i didn t notice that this girlie had a mustache i remember last year the day was october 5th and my family went away

with their hands in the air screamin the party was jammin till at least about 5 and as my friends were leaving they were like homes it was live i thought the party was over but really was just beginnin i turned around i thought i was dreamin i saw four women dressed in red leather tight to their booties i gestured with my index finger come here cuties i tried to be chill i didn t wanna scare em i said hi my name s the prince they said hi prince we re your harem i didn t waste time i started shootin the gift i said y all the type of girls i d like to spend some time with i walked

this type of thing can burn at you they tied me up and they were stealin my furniture i said yo sweetheart what s wrong with you what kind of stuff is this for a nice girl like you to do she turned around and smiled and laughed and that s the way that i noticed that the girlie had a mustache not four girls four guys they were in disguise it was a set up all the time i made a complete fool of myself that day my parents were pullin up just as the u haul truck was pullin away they walked in looked like they seen a ghost there i was gagged and bound and tied to the bed post my pop walked in

the truth for ya i can go on for days about this girl named latoya i was walkin down the block into my homeboy dmx so what the heck so i saw this fresh girl that i never saw before but in my heart should be adored and cared for could never ignore it s a guaranteed love that s highly secured daydreaming hard and really dedicated as the size of my life for one or two minutes then my man dmx just stopped and said yo stop frontin and use your head so i went on over to shoot my best shot takin up the combination to crack the jackpot so i said hi she said goodbye leave me alone because i don t have the time i said it takes a second or something lesser i don t want to frustrate you with no pressure again i ask and be polite i don t want you to turn around and say goodnight it had to be something i said to make her stop in her tracks and make her turn her head when i spoke she listened with the utmost attention and at the end of it all i didn t have to mention nothing really because it was clear now i have the right to call her my dear freshly and intricately spoken but i wanted to leave this young lady heartbroken call it vengeance or call it revenge i m gonna get her back for what she did to me in the beginning now don t fear me you just hear me well what s the matter with you you re lookin dreary look at ya stiff like you re frozen cause while you were choosing you were

hip hop hip hop man i thought this was supposed to be hip hop hip hop i d rather be fishing in flip flops flip flops or cross over to country like kid rock did i can t see no country singers beefing over some guitar riff that willie nelson lifted from bob seger when i was younger i was so eager to have a gun i would do the same couldn t wait to get to the shooting range me and my man goofy gary just trying to let loose some steam motherfuckers laughing cause i couldn t aim so i d pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang i used to have this theory keep three bullets in the gun it was a mandatory year up here in michigan for each bullet if you got no ccw license i tried to apply for one they said it d take five six months what the fuck am i supposed to do mean time when rivals come hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk now back to what my three bullet theory was i m triple platinum i ain t trying to catch no murder one figured i d shoot to wound probably miss with at least one but them other two gon fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up then i mma say it s self defense how come i had the gun was because i was at the range on my way back from this dude approached me on some bullshit i d get a year for each bullet at the most as opposed to having a full clip in that that was my idiotic logic it was basically for safety but it gave me power and it made me crazy and psychotic i just got retarded once i got it thank god it was empty the night that i got caught with it what the fuck man i thought that it was supposed to be hip hop hip hop

death is ageless life is dangerous change is the only thing guaranteed i ain t afraid of the opps cause i know they bleed just like us in the seven kingdoms ain t nobody righteous a massacre at the red wedding the lifeless laid on the ground now who wears the crown a rope tied around by the power we bound sound the trumpets i got soldiers by the hundreds we all want it with our eyes on the summit chaos is a ladder and some fall from it some get tall from it high like they all blunted but this the year that we doing it with no fears god in both ears saying be sincere some are laughing some of em be in tears if this the end let the games begin i think about it when i m in my zone this life is like a game of thrones i sit and think when i m in my zone this life is like a game of

those who have no clue trying to instruct me what to do i return from my pilgrimage only to find out y all haven t grew times going by you like cars on the hwy hairs beginning to turn gray as you

with the answer to why but i still dig like an archaeologist which is merely just to better my witness cause i necessarily don t need this i could just focus on the sky trees animals and seas and believe i m dedicated to living inside gripping your power as i wait on the hour watching homo sapiens quarrel over if it s post mid pre tribulation don t scare me i see the pale horse daily wondering when he s gonna stop at my door so what should i preach about the rapture for if it happens it happens and that would be fresh but if it don t i m gonna praise him until my death let my body rest at my eulogy i request for the speaker to give god the praise and present an invitation to those who may not be saved in the casket my body lays full of chemicals my spirit travels instantly entering into the unseen mystery metaphysical communicating telepathically dismayed by the people i see and the fact that he allowed me to enter into his presence eternally giving me the opportunity to experience the maximal level of gaiety thank you god i m free i m free at liberty what joy is to me receiving positive vibrations from my poetic flows looking upon facial expressions of gaiety at live

choosing to live this way respecting ladies putting smiles on their face but quick to let them know when they act out of place men get treated the same when they come fake i don t hold onto anger so if we must conversate i would show you love the only difference in how we would relate is we would go from hugs to handshakes no time to ponder on who s real and who s phony so i become content with being lonely filled emotionally on developing my identity this is my life and how i channel my energy  at liberty what joy is to me at liberty what joy is to me ps 16 11 rom 15

tha t they are all i have left this is my last resort to make the picture worth it this is my last chance to kill off this weak defensive stance because they say in this world there is someone for everyone but i m struggling to find someone that has experienced everyone and i believe that finding the perfect one has nothing to do with perfection all i can hope for is finding salvation in a traveler walking the same direction i m using a harp and a piano as a serenade and a warning sending a message to corrupted searchers dedicated to exploring my feet are firmly planted where i stand and it would take all you have to knock me down because my strength comes from knowing that one day she ll come around i said my feet are firmly planted where i stand and it would take all you have to

wedding band to a personalized skeleton key even i agree that being alone is a definite possibility it s all lip service with a worthless purpose experimenting with love because you curious my testament is courteous i still believe in covering puddles with nothing but respect but i need to learn separation to keep from getting too complex but when the connection loses clarity i turn into an oracle suddenly being cordial while passing judgment in my own thoughts i m a loyalist to a conformist that changed right before my eyes making it perfectly clear how easy it is to slice right through my ties here is my obeisance to the female intuition no more thoughts of settling down until i truly learn to listen for signs of fixation and warning signs of dying intimacy sleepless night and lonely conversations to tell me what is killing me cause i offer deep eyes and a trustworthy disposition by granting freedom with a home to come to completing your vision i have the wisdom of 50 birthdays jam packed into 23 years steering myself into oblivion looking for that equal match and i have sucked all the innocence that i can from these frontiers so i turn the lights off in this empty room and fade to black my leap of faith is connected to walking down that aisle holding the hand of my shadow enjoying her smile no more compromises my lessons will still be learned walking away from the flames that carelessly burned i never doubted her existence with every secret that i kept i say a prayer before i die hoping that there s some time
