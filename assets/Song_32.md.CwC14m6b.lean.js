son and wifes pure essence and innocence feeding them to a monster that his minds created a massive human form made entirely of teeth repulsive and dripping that feeds on screams this hideous form made flesh by the endless pit that merges parallel dimensions on earth three red windows open portals these windows reveal the same life when the man was born when i was woken from my fetal rest with a rusty kitchen blade his mother lay open amongst decay her peltry gaping gushing fluid over floor tile with his first breath of salty cold biting air my crippled infant chest filled up with sulphur mold and fear his first vision induced panic stricken cries our fathers twisted rotting mind peering out from bulging vacant eyes altered since delivery i carry the burden to feed the nightmare as his loved ones laughter taunts me i will steal whats dear to him as i have suffered so shall he my shadow heaves black vomit scream feeding this beast makes it larger swelling with each shriek it eats we ve bred a man that s made of many teeth scream feeding he is disgusted yet he watches as it grows in one of three red windows scream feeding from reeking gums his rotten laughter leeks as a useless child nothing more than barely human waste his first tooth fell from his sunken pale veiny face he saw that night his creator s saving grace when this first sign of mortal decay was placed under his head in the kennel where he was forced to lay he dreamed so real a splendid day when his mother appeared in flowing white shining a brilliant light through the grim encasing cage embracing him and taking him away so he pulled out all his teeth split wide path divide forced to pry tooth from gum of many others the motherless one you are a fatherless son somehow you arrived the night she first appeared you come from no one rising from a parallel realm of the unknown a cursed dark duplicate from beyond cut away follow them force them here and be rewarded take their skin and you shall see her take their cries to use as fodder hear this now from me your other im upstairs you must not come here keep my family distant from this secret spawn our paths are split yours is worse yet both reflect within each other i feel your dread when you must feed it and your crushing envy for my comfort the creature remains hidden however if our paths collide what we have made will be unleashed to feast

who hounded her so much i ve missed you so she said to him and he felt she was sincere but just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear just another night in the life of the jack of hearts no one

whirl blacker than night were the eyes of felina wicked and evil while casting a spell my love was deep for this mexican maiden i was in love but in vain i could tell one night a wild young cowboy came in wild as the west texas wind dashing and daring a drink he was sharing with wicked felina the girl that i loved so in anger i challenged his right for the love of this maiden down went his hand for the gun that he wore my challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat the handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor just for a moment i stood there in silence shocked by the foul evil deed i had done many thoughts raced through my mind as i stood there i had but one chance and that was to run out through the back door of rosa s i ran out where the horses were tied i caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away i did ride just as fast as i could from the west texas town of el paso out to the badlands of new mexico back in el paso my life would be worthless everything s gone in life nothing is left it s been so long since i ve seen this young maiden my love is stronger than my fear of death i saddled up and away i did go riding alone in the dark maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me tonight nothing s worse than this pain in my heart and at last here i am on the hill overlooking el paso i can see rosa s cantina below my love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to felina i go off to my right i see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more shouting and shooting i can t let them catch me i have to make it to rosa s back door something is dreadfully wrong for i feel a deep burning pain in my side though i m trying to stay in the saddle i m getting weary unable to ride but my love for felina is strong and i rise where i ve fallen though i am weary i can t stop to rest i see the white puff of smoke from the rifle i feel the bullet go deep in my chest from out of nowhere felina has found me kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side cradled by two loving arms that i ll die for one little kiss and felina

and make it cleaner than how we found it where we mean what we say and only say what we mean and where ideals are meant to better ourselves and where we aren t afraid to say i can t where sorry is a liberating word and thank you comes from the heart and where we dont just watch but we decide to act where we refuse to live only until its time to die where we refuse to live only until its time to die where feelings and desires mean more than quotas expectations and disappointed stares where we have a right to hurt scream cry live die and sit in silence just because we fucking can i dream of a

another where we find comfort in silence and a place of peace in all of the noise and where everything that is thrown at us makes us better stronger and more appreciative where we celebrate life death and all that comes in between where songs sing to us and a loved ones words make us dance where what we see in a mirror is a happy satisfied and fulfilled individual and where we feel bad about how we look at others and not just because of how others look at us i dream of a world where i can love you where i can feel you and where i can know you without having to own you without having to hate you

im married im living healthy eating coconuts and diced pineapples thank you very much a lot of boys are just pac men copping and dropping all the cherries they popping stop it this all is getting very scary why cant we keep the peace instead having wars on prairies the prairies that natives hunted in you started throwing hundreds and now the system is searching for something to cut off like your bank deposits loans for college school budgets but maybe thats just politics either way it s us for the people by the people were supposed to keep it equal but see two score and ten years ago we lost

not for mine for you for real i mean this is all i feel from the chrome to my toes this the deal and i really don t mind if some of you don t care cuz hate is always a scream and love is only a whisper and not showing it ain t a crime but not all of us feel cared for we re beaten down and barefoot out there there s a father and a mother sitting next to each other a boy and a girl who are falling in love and about ten other people who are starting to judge cuz someone don t have either or or cuz the middle class still counts their money twice and the poor just sit around staring up at

shades you and pops never really got along who was right or wrong 15 years old kicked out all alone in this cold world and i can only imagine what you was going through cause i was so young when it happened mama cried like a baby that day she never blamed you it was painful cause she knew the streets was waiting to claim you over time we could see the hardness in your face wanted to help but couldn t find the words to say i guess i went into denial hoping for the very best stopped believing in they god cause what god would allow this not in my wildest nightmares nothing compares to see my brother be a crack fiend for all these years tried to send you inspiration when you was locked in the pen but soon as you came home you right back on that shit again and mama say she don t feel safe with you home she got to hide money and lock her room door when she gone we still love you but until you find strength in yourself and the will power to open up and accept our help what can we do i can t let you terrorize mom dukes we feeling like we just gone have to turn you loose they say in war there s no victory without causalities but when it hits your family that s when you really see like a window to my soul you can see the pain in my life got to make a change in my life and it s not impossible to make a change in my life i can make a change in my life i know i know it s hard coming home to the same old shit ain t nothing changed cause the game don t quit the pain inside is still throbbing the same conditions that first created the drug problems still exist and it s a bitch got to go to the job or starve without a gun every day employees get robbed and on days off we blow off them crumbs like nothing getting high cause a nigga gotta get into something but we get trapped in a cycle of pain and addiction and lose the motivation to change the condition i blame it on the system but the problem is ours it s not a question of religion it s a question of power how did black life my life end up so hard why do so much injustice go unresolved why the ones we call governments be the main causes behind why all the dope is coming through the borders television reporters got the facts distorted making scapegoats of every black youth on the corner it s a war even though they don t call it a war it s chemical war unleashed on the black and the poor and who benefit the police lawyers and judges the private owned prison industry with federal budgets all them products in the commissary tell me who profits it s obvious and it s going too good for them to stop it in my mind my body and my soul i need a change in my life we need a change in our lives you know and it s not impossible to make a change in our lives we can take the pain from our lives fa sho we don t own no boats we don t own no planes to bring no dope we don t make no cellophane we just caught up in the game don t you know don t you know it s bigger than this shit i know you know i know what s in your heart dawg i love you til the end of time and again and again i mma be your brother your comrade and your friend til we win and even

makin it right now everybody in his cypher got something to say ayo you need to quit scratching man that shit won t pay and pops kicked him out put his tables on the street just cause he wasn t down with the itt but he knew they d catch the vapors one day or another so he dropped his boy a breeze to take it down to his brother now he coolin with his brother but he buggin bout the papes ain t trynna hit the little club on wednesdays and mixtapes that junk ain t payin no bills who you tryin to fool so once again his jockey joe blow is on the move and now he s house to house sleeping on the

without that he sorta slipped get to drinkin and flippin not thinkin and always wishin yo i got a solution it s called show me some love we all guilty of not doin it you can hear it above x2 we should

it ain t from the heart what we do is what we been doing from the start ain t makin music for executives sitting behind the desk i tell them fools to eat a dick and bring it live to they chest cause this is art that you created you get paid with respect a little patience and pride and with that you pose a threat take a heed young brotha to the words i speak unless you wanna see your promos lying there in the street cause money is man made and any time it can be gone just kick back spark one up and peek the words to this song  when push comes to shove i rise above sort of keep my eyes mind focused on the goal that is love so when fans give it i rip it return it earn respect see i m in it for that and not a fat paycheck on that cino you can quote thes cause i said it s true money doesn t equal happiness no matter who smiles and piles checks while i m on the steps drinking beck s with my friends piece and our forties cause we don t got ends memories like that to me are los angeles palm

break it down and demonstrate to you why it s not as bad as they make it sound see you re the president that i believe can handle this heck ya campaign slogan was yes we cannabis just kidding but seriously let s examine this subject truthfully dawg look so you taught constitutional law at harvard right in 96 well you should know the declaration of independence was drafted outta hemp so were the sails that pushed our ships on the path to the colonies so was the fuel used for henry ford s model t so in a sense you could say that pot has actually driven american history but how can that be when some of the most successful people smoked weed from walt disney to milton fried from stephen king to steve jobs the apple didn t fall far from the tree you get it steve jobs apple trees jobs created the apple computer high off weed see people believe that this plant is sinful but let s go back in time and find out exactly where these beliefs came from cause before the 1930 s you could blaze up but after the 1930 s things changed up cause that s man president hoover commissioned a man named harry j anslinger as head of the federal bureau of narcotics his middle name s ironic cause he was the main guy attempting to demonize marijuana ummm i mean cannabis sativa see the name marijuana he created as propaganda for the people to make it sound more dirty and a little more evil figured if he scared the public enough they would want it illegal he teamed up with newspapers who had their own motivations google decorticator the newspapers printed fake stories about how every puff destroys your brain making you crazy insane prone to murder and rape the used race and then said again that weed makes white women get pregnant by negroes and immigrant mexicans and based off of no research and investigation congress rubber stamped that legislation and then poof there was a law around it so we accepted it and never thought about it but let s get smart about it lies and greed are the real reasons that it s illegal and the reason you got that look on your face when i talk about it smoking weed with the president with the pres smoking weed with the president with the pres smooking weed smoke smoke smoking weed with the president getting high getting higher than i ever been smoking weed with the president with the pres smoking weed with the president with the pres smooking weed smoke smoke smoking weed with the president getting high getting higher than the deficit a jackass ok how about we talk about this rationally every 6 seconds a person dies from tobacco and every 13 from alcohol guess how many died in the last ten thousand years from weed none at all that s zip zero nada no chance to overdose not one case in history and no i am not blowing smoke don t be a coward just regulate and control it take the power from the drug dealers who contaminate sell it and own it see they love the laws the way they are because they make millions when drug lords support your laws it s time to amend them as for the kids yeah i d agree except it s easier for kids to buy weed today than to buy beer or cigarettes is that surprising think about it sir how many drug dealers you know ask to see id and stop saying it s a gateway drug something so strong that you can t break away from big homie listen quit being a politician studies show it s non addictive and gateway theory is a lot of fiction a contradiction and you can quote me for it you said marijuana was a useless drug hold up a moment medical tests and evidence show it s proven to treat glaucoma cancer asthma multiple sclerosis it could do so much if it was legal but if it was legal a lot of pharmaceutical drugs wouldn t be needed i did my research and it seems that big pharma gave you a millions of dollars so if weed became legal they would lose a lot of profit and you would lose funding so tell me mr presidential is it really public health or is it special interest are you worried about the kids or the private businesses only a few years back you was against lobbying and corporate robbery you campaigned for change well dammit now demonstrate it in policy cause if you really wanna stimulate the economy and mitigate the problems that emanate from poverty it s time to legalize this billion dollar commodity harvard professor jeffrey myron estimated 9 billion dollars generated in taxes from regulation plus another 11 will be saved from law enforcement resources and incarcerations that s 20 billion total every year you saying this country don t need that kind of paper put it towards environment invest in education infrastructure in conjunction with job creation or maybe a combination just stop laughing at this situation and give it serious consideration it ain t a joke ain t nothing funny the country s broke and its people need money it s simple economics  you did it bush did it clinton did it lincoln did it and now you throw people in prison for this crime that we committed mr president if it s such a sin then why don t you and the men i just named turn yourselves in i beg your pardon see i don t wanna hear that circular logic we ain t in that oval office let s be honest if you got caught with marijuana the day you smoked there wouldn t even be an obama no barack at that prestigious college of harvard getting his speeches polished with honors cause today you can t get a student loan if caught with one weed cigarette but you can have a rape conviction on your record and still get a check from the government yo what the fuck is this do you not see injustice when it s people suffering sick dying of cancer who s only relief is a plant proven to ease pain but that will mean handcuffs that will mean being called a criminal that will mean thrown behind bars pitiful mr president this ain t political it s commonsensical millions in prison for something that s never killed a single individual but you make deals with prescription drug advocates when just last year more americans died from prescriptions in they cabinets than heroin terrorism murder and traffic accidents combined mr president open your eyes and see the blood on the wall these companies wouldn t care if the country was coming apart they sharks they only care about how much it ll cost ain t been a disease cured in 60 years why cause a patient cured is a customer lost well i say enough is enough it s time for us to fix this it s time to get away from the pharmaceutical interests forget about the stigma forget the opinions of politicians cause collective ignorance don t mean wisdom forget about pandering to the system cause when the system s wrong sir it s your duty to go against it i urge you to re read that 9th amendment and have courage and conviction and remember your commitment to the people cause what if it was malia what if she needed a drug that was illegal to survive would things change would they be a little different would policy remain put yourself in that position and no i m not wishing that on you just illustrating the consequences of this little plant situation cause a lot of politicians hate it but i just broke it down it
