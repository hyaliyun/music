they circle no ocean nearby like lost souls theyre crying lamenting their plight the sun rises and sets in the same goddamn place shadows circle my body and laugh in my face though i set out to find me a whole brand new life i dont want to forget her i dont want to

was done and when those pirates boarded us they told us one by one you can die or join me crew me boys time flies when you re having rum time flies when you re having rum me boys time flies when you re having rum when you re sailing under the black flag and you re firing all your guns when you take a spanish treasure ship you divide by the rule of thumb our voyage will be over soon enough time flies when you re having rum with a pistol to my forehead well my choice was all too clear i took leave of that merchant ship and became a buccaneer and though they spared my life i think that if the truth be told i d join them for the promises of adventure rum and gold the quartermaster handed me a cutlass and a gun and as i signed their articles the captain told me son us gentlemen of fortune

truly blessed he came to take our place but some of us so called believers take an awkward stance and deny the doctrine that he was god and man and dont believe in christ as creator of man from dust why should we trust him if he was just a man like us and tell me this if christ was not god with men then how did he manage to live apart from sin with no flaws within and heres the major test when the last time you seen a man raise from death i know never its impossible unless of course jesus christ was god in the flesh and lord further proof that jesus is one with god hebrews 1 the father refers to the son as god i could go on for days with this scriptural proof cause this ain t just my opinion its biblical truth plus its one of the core essentials of the faith somethin we must believe if we some christians and we saved if we dont believe this then we denyin the bible and we believe in a different christ our god is an idol he is savior creator exact representation of his nature he is more than just a man he is god in the flesh made like us now in his grace we can rest he is the christ he is savior creator exact representation of his nature he is more than just a man he is god in the flesh made like us now in his grace we can rest behold the christ look i dont think we quite comprehend the concept the kinda lavish paradise the son left for the kinda rejection he would come get on the cross breath in his lungs it was none left was it love yes but nonetheless there still wasnt a place for the son to rest not only through leavin heaven was his love expressed but god the son in flesh christ would come and step on earth the coldest place he showed his grace then died but his life didnt go to waste was rich and more than comfortable but he made himself poor with grace he was made for a lil while lower than angels but some still dont embrace him hes longin to save ya and if he does hes unashamed to call ya brother cause we got the same father its god above us in everyway he made himself like us was even tested main yet remained righteous we can t complain and say he can t relate to us cause he was made just like the ones he made from dust faithful to us died as propitiation quenched his wrath and took a load off depraved men but dont be fooled like satan had the son in defeat cause now he sits on the throne with all under his feet","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

most thought the kid was insane even those close to me my homies wasn t feeling it mayne but still i wanted some more i wanted to know this infinite king you restored my heart and your glory started to stick in my brain i couldn t get enough of your scripture i was simply amazed by acts galatians revelation 1 corinthians james i couldn t fathom something would happen to make me stray away i couldn t imagine leaving my dad that took me from my playa ways who rescued me from the storm all those gray and rainy days the one with that amazing grace the same one who gave me faith but recently

your glorious throne i d put myself in the back seat and seek your glory alone but now because i love it less i m becoming morally wrong i may look the same to all the others but lord you notice i m gone you know i long to come back i miss that peace i used to feel when i d reap pray unceasingly and read what you ve revealed but i m not plus i got a minor depression that i m hating to learn a lesson now i m waiting i m starting to question my salvation i m nothing i m dirt i need something to work so i ll try the only thing that does i gotta jump in ya word and maybe if i read i ll be able to recapture the things that made fall in love with jesus king and master i know it ll be a struggle but i gotta fight hard to delight in the christ who saved me like lifeguards i m cryin out i m

one knows whats at stake and i feel stuffed at the moment so don t put more on my plate i found myself on my aunts couch at 4am on christmas asking when this loneliness had been put on my wish list in fact that s when outcast was penned to the page to deconstruct emotions and to save me from rage now if you take a second to look at it all from my perspective you ll see i m dealing with a lot more than i first expected you ll see i lost most of the people that i first protected and lost a lot of the faith in the ones i first respected don t say that i m changing since i m aware it s the truth i ve been looking for change and lately it s all that i do so if you live in the shadows come join the youth in the limelight and realize you ll be happier when looking in hindsight i ll be buried alive i ll be buried inside this place today i ll be buried alive i am a too young to die today in this place these words don t mean shit until you give them a meaning since i just rap what i m writing and i just write what i m seeing so if my world seems dark you ll see darkness repeating and when i start breathing easy you ll see darkness retreating but please don t paint me as an angel or with eloquent lights please don t always think i m down because the music i write i love the fans that i get and i do my best to be nice but there s a difference from my music and my personal life there are things about my life some people say isn t right and if i wrote all my thoughts there d be some shit you don t like but now i m just being honest just like i promised you all so here s a simple little question why d you all let me fall i put in weeks worth of work just making sure it was perfect but when the record released it seems my efforts were worthless now i m feeling worthless fuck this feeling the earth gives everything went unnoticed so now i m rolling with new kids  i am not the type to follow footsteps that i know won t lead the way i am not the type to meet my heroes god i

with trapping but knew it canceled out the maturation of black men i flirted with it i even got dirty with it wasn t in it all the way but half way like thirty minutes ya know i was behaving like i m lost still had a passion for the cross deep inside i knew i had to choose sides so the next morning i was up praying to god i m praying to god deep in the water but i m set free deep in the water lord

soul to soul but i guess that dont matter anyway cuz if these walls could speak i know what theyd say i know what theyd say took the hallway to the bedroom where my parents used to sleep where id sneak in during quiet and my nightmares grew too deep and i walked over to the closet where my father hung his ties i still smell the scent of cigarettes and years gone by that closet used to look so tall and now everything around here seems so small but if these streets could whisper if these walls could speak they would scream out love they would cry themselves to sleep they would pray to jesus
