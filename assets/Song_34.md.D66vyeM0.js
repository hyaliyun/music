eyes that witnessed a father beat on a mother witnessed a system take away her only brother no one ever said that they loved her she used to shut her eyes and make the brain subside but now she s got her 10 minute high just for a little while she s queen of all the skies if her head is bad another one she can buy but everybody tells her to stop she would try but nobody gave her a good reason why time has taken its toll she looks too old for seventeen the girl is much too bold her heart is cold when it used to be of gold her future has no chance to unfold she s used her body to get her way is she ashamed of the games she s played but her best defense is to block out all the pain but first she buys her 10 minute high just for a little while she s floating through the sky what s she gonna do when she no longer can fly is she gonna land on her feet or come down to die or is she gonna just break down and cry  when she comes down it all becomes too clear she knows that someday she should face her fears but she lost touch of reality and over the years she s forgotten what it feels to be real it s early morning quiet is the street she lays in silence the cold cement beneath her feet she passed away and today s her eighteenth birthday and all she s left me to say is she just had her last 10 minute high did she contemplate that it would take away her life she probably knew but she had

of a day we had a lifetime of atonement i felt loved i didn t have to treasure the moment instead of drugs we gave out hugs and you payed with pain no more thugs and everybody knew everybody s name no tricks no cheaters women beaters pimps or whores less stress and a whole lot less liquor stores children played without worries of strays longer days with shorter nights no need to fight we all stuck tight we stayed away from the traps as a people we lived right and exact and showed a whole lot more of that in my dream we all loved our neighbors did each other favors and used the good sense god gave us watched each others backs and lifted while we climb there was no crime none of my brothers was doin time and they treated all their sisters like ladies women didn t worry because their men didn t act shady mothers were proud of their seeds and kept a big smile cause the whole village chipped in and raise that one child we supported our local black owned stores we were down for the cause the next man make sure you had yours there were no robberies murders or rapes no child molesters we took control of our own fate the life span of the black man increased times were less stressed we did our best to live in peace we showed love for rap kept in contact we stayed away from the traps and showed a whole lot more of that  now as i wake up to face this harsh mentality it s just a dream or prayer far from reality as i wait the siren sounds begin again i get up walk to my window wondering if it will ever end when i look out nothing s changed hustlers are still there lady on the phone

said touch them i touched them like a diabetic third grader opening a snickers bar you said hard i thought yes i am but you are so soft i said your lips theyre like whale blubber that wasnt my best line but it worked tonight in the grocery store i found one of your hairs in my underwear i pulled it out in the frozen food section and screamed that is so gorgeous it could kill a man good thing im a leprechaun lucky lucky baby i have no idea how this will end maybe the equator will fall like a hula hoop from the earths hips and our mouths will freeze mid kiss on our 80th anniversary or maybe tomorrow my absolute insanity combined with the absolute obstacle course of your communication skills will leave us like a love letter in a landfill but whatever whenever however this ends i want you to know that right now i love you forever i love you for the hardest mile we walked together for the night i collected every sharp knife in the house and threw them one by one on the roof then told the sun listen show off from now on you are only to give me blades of grass things that are growing and soft cause theres this girl who says she wants to float on her back through my bloodstream and when she does i want my rivers to reach the sea dyou hear me lover do you know the night you told me you had a crush on my ears i swore to never to become van gogh and look baby they are both still there just like my firefly heart is still right there in your glass jar i never trusted anybody more to poke enough holes in the lid so on the nights you sleep like a ballerina i try to snore like a piccolo and i press my lips to your holy temples and i say i crash into things in the dark even when the lights are on and i am wrong more often than i am writing and even then i am often wrong but when my friends are in the bathroom at the bar rolling dollar bills into telescopes claiming they can see god i will come to you holding my grandmothers bible i will press it to your chest and i will bless it with your breath and when you ask if i wanna roleplay altar boys fucking in the kitchen during sunday mass i will say hell yes but only if you leave a hickey on my ass in the shape of jesus palm so i can be sure i got nailed down lover you will never lose me to the wind you are the lightning that made me fill my chest with candles you are the thunder clapping for the poem that nobody else wants to hear you are an icicles tear watering a tulip on the first day of spring you melt me alive you kiss me as deep as my roots will reach and i want nothing more than to be an eyelash fallen on your cheek then being collected by your fingers and held like a wish i promise that whatever i do i will always try my best to come

lights it s the essence for bringing you back as the water fills your lung with despair you sink to a bottomless hole of depression the choirs of chastity sings your name but beneath the surface you cannot hear and i know it s hard to look up when the world stares you back but if you follow the sound of absolution you will find your feet on a solid ground and i will sweep my arms around you and keep you safe for as long as you need me to and as your heavy heart sinks to the bottom i know that life will lead the way life will guide you home  breathe in breathe out even though it hurts on the inside i know that here at the end of the road your love will shine on chin up stay strong never let the world tell you wrong i know that here at the end of the road your spark will shine through don t speak a word of you letting go cause i know you will make it through don t close the light that will carry you cause i know you will make it through breathe in breathe

when we were young and fucking careless we had the world right in front of us planned out all set we were young at heart but as time goes by i believe that the world is fucking spinning and it tears us apart i m waiting on the next wave from my life to sweep me off my feet i can barely hold on for myself what about my dreams what about my dreams it s the illusion of being free it wraps up around me holds me down and takes the breath right of me the hands of time is slowly tearing everything apart will we stand together do you remember all these years ago shooting stars above we re laying down below i remember our conversations we lived our lives in our imaginations the sand is pouring through the hourglass we re stuck at the bottom with no turning back at least for me cause all i can see is the memories of everything we wished we could be i m holding on to the thought of who we used to be i used to be the one that you d turn to when your days were rough we were young at heart careless

himself proud of the magnificent achievements of his children decided to call a special banquet for the greatest thieves in all the land he sent invites to thousands of the greatest murders rapists and general assorted scum inviting them to attend his palace at the dawn of the new moon each thief would be given a chance to stake his claim as the greatest messenger of murder upon the planet and the devil himself would then decide who should be crowned king after many days of deliberating all of the petty thieves such as street criminals have been found far short of the required level of wickedness and there were just four sets of thieves left in the competition they were the monarchs of empire a cartel of bankers the heads of religious orders and the third world dictators each set of thieves appointed a spokesman to give his case to the devil we have recorded these events for posterity uh listen uh okay yo first up was the thief of the worst reputation dictator of a third world nation he looked the devil in the eye as he spoke in an oh so serious tone dear mr devil i am the greatest thief there has ever been on earth please tell me who else more than me personifies your work i came to power in a military coup i murdered the elected president he wanted to use the resources of our country for our peoples benefit i proved to masters in the west i could kill my own people just as well as the best so i took over the so called independent country when the foreigners left sent squads of death to those who would suggest in power should be the one they elect erected a statue of the great man that raped our mothers stole our lands thats how little self respect i have dont fight slavery it makes me glad account in switzerland rolls royce murder and rape cos i want new toys dont want a portion but a whole fortune with that profit whats a little bit of torture even outlawed my indigenous culture and language and history and taught our people to only worship colonizers and of course me  thief its the banquet of the thieves come and dine with me its the banquet of the thieves the banquet of the thieves the devil was so impressed with this wonderful man he almost ejaculated on his hands but the monarch of the empire said excuse me mr devil id like to speak if i may who do you think trained this amateur dictator to behave this way yeah im sure before i came along his country was far from heaven but look of the carnage i caused all over the earth its got to be the work of the devil countless deaths mass enslavement deliberate starvation of whole nations the dictator tries his best but looking at me hes just an imitation who do you think pays his wages he would love to be trading places ive been doing this ting on the roads way back way back way back since the middle ages everybody knows hes a criminal element they think im democratic and benevolent and that shows that im really devilish cos people think im heaven sent i couldnt care about democracy you all know no one elected me the people love me despite my crimes sucka mcs wanna bite my shine so blingin out of control you would vomit dont even touch dough but my face is on it im a pervert whos in the cloak of the clergy yes im a pervert who uses the cloak im a despicable character i use my position of authority and spiritual reverence im a despicable character mr devil allow me to speak for all of the religious leaders that leech in the world of creeps im initiated i take the peoples faith and dissipate it with false promises hollow oratory dont need a gun its daylight robbery dear mr devil i thought you would like it how i use their faith in god to keep them blinded put on a nice voice read them a book and they believe that i am not a crook tell them god will repay them in the next they give me their life savings so i can buy jets all the reports about child sex none of us have ever gone to jail yet this system of stealing so appealing convinces the victims their lives have meaning monarchs boast about conquest but needed my blessings to get it done and all of the dictators use my books therefore they are just my sons the devil was sure this was the winner and was just about to put an end to the dinner but then the man from the banking cartel stepped up and said i think im the biggest sinner all of those three depend on me all they ever do is defending me cos i paid for all of the things they have of course and all of the lives they lead paid for the guns bombs and the tanks thats why you see there is always more i turned sciences basic appliance into a client of weapon and war paid for monarchies armed robberies i make monopolies out of property never shot a gun nor killed anyone myself but billions die cos of me who needs a threat i make a debt out of thin air just sit back and collect every single day whatever they say the people need me just to connect it yet none of them knows what i look like yet all of them spend my money to look nice they want more no ones pure i hold the keys to every single door sell sex and drugs profit and lies earth and skies ill even sell life ill even sell freedom for the right price but no one is smart enough to ask me nice so mr devil give me the medal dont be biased if you dont give it to me ill just buy it thief its the banquet of the thieves come and dine with me its the banquet of the

burnt and then weakened i ve kept the purest of secrets the pain was buried in lesions and man my problems with the music lead to stern disagreements with all my people close as i just yearn for achievement i can confirm i m in need of some happiness to be frequent i m mid experiment but see i m lacking a thesis i hope you see me for me so i m in stitches and seamless a neurological genius appreciations been fleeting i m living life without meaning i ve been implanted with a gift to grow a tree that is seedless to lose it s leaves in a sequence i wish i would be strong but timing is my

m thinking how did i make it here i hate to sound crazy but i grew up in a trailer and i m in a house let me take a moment here to tell you how it was for me a kid who s sitting all alone and drawing in a book to think the way my life would be if i had money man it s funny see i thought that having money was the key to solving everything but it ain t see people take advantage of you every day it makes your friends see you different and makes them change they turn to snakes living with it man i m so afraid of losing everything i m spending it i need to save i only wanted us to work so we could find a way to find a place to live and see that all the bills are paid but people think because you make a little money they can take it all away but fuck it isn t theirs to take i hate to say it but my family is all i got cause all the haters hate to see i left the trailer park i made a life with a girl i wanna marry cause she s the only one i got she s the only one i trust oh my god i m getting sick and feel like giving up i made a living off my life but fuck it s getting tough man if i m dreaming can somebody come and wake me up i wanna help the ones i love but fuck i never make enough i

trials and they get sad when they don t feel the title admittedly they re living in denial relationships their new religion the internet is their bible so when the time comes i ll be gone i m calling

of domestic abuse nancy wishes she could teach her man a lesson or two so nancy saw through the lies that she explained it was transparent as a dad who had a sex change this was kinda like a cry for help her baby just died she could die herself plus her other son was living in this hell he was age twelve what s his name his name s isaac tears dripping from his eyelids sitting in the corner playing angry birds forgetting angry words he heard in private he didn t sniffle he just let the tears trickle in silence the smile that he wore to school was one of his disguises he would soon exit

the color of violet in front of her son isaac nancy d seen her at the hospital abused she was too afraid to run away impossible to move so nancy slid up in the room like stethoscope glinting in the moonlight but he hadn t seen it sparkle yet the middle of the physical argument he had the veins popping out the face marlboro red her uniform medical mask masquerade somersault behind the table like a woman half her age then nancy popped up told him stop what pop pop gun sound then he dropped what now sarah screamed out into the june night and put her hand to her mouth like

another one and i wanted to give them that feeling of wow like wow growing pains iii and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like man he s still there he s still logic like wow i m a fan i know what it s like and you kind of dread like ohh what s that album gonna sound like for me i wanted to give them this it opens up with a skit and i love wu tang clan so i always loved their skits so it s basically about the first time i ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy and then it opens up outside i can hear em bussin bussin and the police they rushin go to my head like concussion and i m about fifteen years old at that time and the gunshots i still hear them every now and then throughout my life and i m wondering i always used to wonder what caused that shootout why did i hear his what was it so i kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was in fact a true event so that goes in when you first hear me rapping i m laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind from the eviction notice on my door you know just being on food stamps and welfare and not knowing what s going to happen tomorrow and just all the wonders and then the beat changes up and i actually fall asleep so this is my inner most subconscious thoughts that i didn t even realize at the time at fifteen years old but now you know at twenty four and looking back reminiscing i know that those are the things that are on my mind because growing up in that situation no matter what um the only time i was special the only time i was anybody was when i was asleep when i was asleep i was a famous basketball player baseball player i was a rapper artist i was a singer i was an actor i was dancer i was an astronaut but when i woke up i was just a boy from a broken home and that that was very hard to swallow even touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family you know growing up on the cosby s and family matters and you know that was the closest thing i had to a real family once the television program turned off or our electricity turned off i snapped back to reality um i didn t end it on a bright note because there s people out there that feel that same way so i wanted them to know that i m with them and i m there and i was there and i understand so

canon of criminal procedure pedagogy in one compact teachable verse the song forces us to think about traffic stops vehicle searches drug smuggling probable cause and racial profiling and it beautifully tees up my favorite pedagogical heuristic life lessons for cops and robbers and as it turns out im not late to the game after all jay z recently published a well received volume of criticism and commentary that includes his own marginal notes on verse 2 of 99 problems when i teach the fourth amendment i ask my students what the doctrines tell us about on the one hand how to catch bad guys and not risk suppression and on the other how to avoid capture or at least beat the rap if not the ride im always happy to tell my own stories but the song struck me as the perfect teaching tool all the students know it and importantly for pedagogical purposes it gets some things rightand some things very wrong it turns out that while some other law professors have noticed 99 problems no one has yet provided a detailed accurate analysis of the fourth amendment issues verse 2 raises in this essay i remedy that deficiency in the literature this is after all one of the most popular songs of the last decade and we should seize the opportunity to use it in our teaching my audience accordingly is primarily teachers and students of criminal procedure but i hope that my comments may be of some interest to cops and perps as well verse 2 1 the year is 94 in my trunk is raw 2 in my rearview mirror is the motherfucking law 3 got two choices y all pull over the car or 4

legit 16 well do you mind if i look around the car a little bit 17 well my glove compartment is locked so is the trunk in the back 18 and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that 19 aren t you sharp as a tack you some type of lawyer or something 20 or somebody important or something 21 nah i ain t pass the bar but i know a little bit 22 enough that you won t illegally search my shit 23 well we ll see how smart you are when the k 9s come 24 i got 99 problems but a bitch ain t one hit me ii analysis a line 1 the year is 94 and in my trunk is raw jay z was transporting drugs in his car like many of the protagonists who populate the core cases of fourth amendment law unlike most of them he gets away with it jay z says that the story in 99 problems describes a real incident in 1994 jay z was dealing crack in new york city and was expanding to other markets as he puts it new york guys had better connects and opened up drug markets down the i 95 corridor drug prices increase with distance from importation zones and new york was a key transshipment hub so presumably he was able to offer better product and prices to smaller regional markets for several reasons the transportation of illegal drugs has produced a veritable cornucopia of fourth amendment case law retail sales are often conducted either inside or via drop points making themif done competentlyrelatively difficult to police and even if you do a buy and bust with an undercover wearing a wire retail transactions are still small potatoes sentences increase with quantity retail sale busts dont get you promotions and press conferences wholesale loads in transit on the other hand are pure gold both for the dealer and for the cops and prosecutors who want to bust him at one hundred milligrams of cocaine per street dose of crack a twenty kilo wholesale load of powder cocaine is 200 000 potential street sales of crack thatll get you your lambo or your press conference respectively most importantly it has to be transported on public roads in a vehicle and vehicles as it happens present far more opportunities for searchingas a matter of law and practicethan houses or people so its no wonder that the recent history of fourth amendment law is so full of cases about stopping cars and searching them for drugs as the joke goes you look for your keys where the light is theres a lot of fourth amendment law packed into the simple question when can you use a traffic stop to search for drugs jay z says that in the actual incident the drugs were concealed in a hidden compartment built into the sunroof of the car in the video the drugs are in three briefcases in the trunk and the stop occurs on a surface street in bedford stuyvesant in brooklyn as he suggests both in the book and in the song he was probably targeted by the new jersey police for fitting a drug courier profile law students have to learn the hard lesson that racial profiling does not give rise to a fourth amendment suppression claim if there was objective probable cause for the stop for example suppose a police department systematically pulled over every black driver who exceeded the speed limit while letting all the white speeders go if contraband was legitimately found in a black drivers car during the stop he would not have a suppression claim based on the fact that the department systematically targeted black drivers those claims do have remediesfourteenth amendment remediesand most importantly political remedies they dont however have fourth amendment remedies which means there wont be any suppression the u s supreme court made this explicit in whren v united states back in 1996 if there is objective probable cause for a stop the courts may not inquire into the officers subjective motivation as a basis for a fourth amendment suppression claim b lines 34 in my rearview mirror i got two choices the calculation jay z has to make is whether knowing that the car contains concealed contraband hes better off trying to flee or hoping that the police wont find the drugs during the stop this may be the hardest choice perps face but theres only one answer you are always better off having drugs found on you in a potentially illegal search than you are fleeing from a potentially illegal search and getting caught the flight will provide an independent basis for chasing and arresting you and the inadequacy of the quantum of suspicion supporting the initial attempted seizure will not taint the contraband discovered if there is an intervening flight law students practice explaining the preceding sentence to a layperson smugglers repeat after me you have to eat the bust and fight it in court c line 5 i aint trying to see no highway chase with jake jake is the cops and jay zs narrator is making a prudential business decision here highspeed chases are almost always bad for the perp if youre caught after a highspeed chase you can be certain that the police will impound the car run a dog over it and search it thoroughly so if youre going to run youd better either get away or ditch your load mid chase but the latter is dicey because your load will likely be found and youll have no suppression remedy because you abandoned it before you were technically seized and its not an option at all if the load is in the trunk or a concealed compartment where you cant get at it youre also not likely to get away the supreme court recently held that the fourth amendment permits the use of deadly force to terminate high speed chases in that case the suspect fled from an ordinary traffic stop the police chased him and when he still didnt stop the police rammed him from behind at over eighty five miles an hour sending his car spinning off the road and into a tree killing him the court watched the dashboard camera video and pronounced the response reasonable here you have to know the local rules because some jurisdictions have banned high speed chases as a matter of policy washington d c for example did so after two children were killed by a driver being chased by police in those jurisdictions the cops will take your plates and come find you later theyll still find you of course but youd probably have time to get the contraband out of the car and hide or discard it then youd avoid the trafficking bust and you would just have to eat a reckless endangerment charge for the flight itself and even better for the perp if the car or the plates are stolen you might get clean away but jay z didnt have a stolen car or plates the new jersey state police are not a no chase department and he was on an interstate they would have chased him and even if he had been able to open the sunroof compartment and throw the load out it would likely have been found the better business decision was to stay cool d line 6 i got a few dollars i can fight the case staying cool is easier to do of course if you have a few dollars to hire a good attorney if youre going to get an overworked public defender or a bottom feeding court lurker wholl just try to get you to take a quick plea then bouncing on the double starts to look more attractive even given the considerations discussed above jay z had money he could get a good lawyer he made the right choice jay z is also betting that theres no dog on scene he can perhaps see in his rearview mirror that the cruiser behind him is not a canine unit and he knows that dog units are few and far between in any event and he knows that without a dog sniff there will be no probable cause for a search to search a vehicle an officer must have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband or evidence of a crime at this point the only probable cause the officer has is the speeding offense the compartment is concealed and theres nothing in plain view so no search is going to permissibly occur unless the officer arrests jay z for the traffic offense and impounds the car jay z is assuming the officer wont do that because its a big hassle and an embarrassment if the car turns up clean if theres no dog on scene the law here is clear prolongation of the stop to wait for a dog unit to arrive will trigger suppression e line 7 so i pull over at this point jay z has been seized for purposes of fourth amendment analysis because he has submitted to a show of police authority he has thus preserved his fourth amendment claims if you are stopped illegally and want to fight it later you have to submit to the show of authority in this case if the police find the contraband hell be able to challenge it in court smart decision here by jay z f line 8 do you know what im stopping you for this is an important part of any traffic stop colloquy that should be memorialized by the prudent driver ideally on a cell phone unless you are in one of the thirteen states that require two party consent for audio recording neither new york nor new jersey is on the list so jay z could record the stop both the real one and the one in the video his west coast rivals are not so lucky however california is a two party consent state memorialization of the stated basis for the stop is important because the government must be able to show that the stop was based on probable cause and youll be able to put the cop on the stand so if you later develop evidence that you were not in fact doing what the officer said you were at the time the officer will either have to fight the evidence or else come up with a different basis for the stop in which case hell have to contradict his contemporaneous explanation this can happen and judges find it most displeasing g lines 910 cause im young and im black and my hats real low at the time the song takes place the new jersey state police had an active drug courier profiling program that would absolutely have included the observable facts here jay z was young male black wearing attire favored by drug dealers driving an expensive car traveling on i 95 such profiles are of questionable validity as the sole basis for a stop but there is no constitutional reason why they cannot inform an officers subjective determination to stop someone if there is objective probable cause for the stop the supreme court has answered this question definitively pretext is not a basis for fourth amendment suppression if there is objective probable cause i dont know smart response for two reasons first it allows you to make a record of the officers asserted basis for the stop second it doesnt admit any misconduct theres no need whatsoever to blurt out sorry officer i know i was speeding h line 11 am i under arrest a great question and an important one for any future suppression claim as new lawyers learn there is no constitutional problem with arresting someone for a traffic violation no matter how minor and if you are arrested for a traffic violation your car can be impounded and then searched to inventory its contents without a warrant and without any level of suspicion that the car contains contraband your person clothing and bags can also be searched with no required quantum of suspicion on the other hand if you are not under arrest the police need probable cause to search the car so if the cop tells you youre not under arrest and then proceeds to search the car you will be able to suppress any contraband if you can show that there was no probable cause for the search here again documentation will be important i line 12 you was doing fifty five in a fifty four all driversnot just those smuggling drugshave reason to complain about what they see as arbitrary speed enforcement drive down a highway with a marked limit of sixty five and youll see that virtually every car is speeding the cultural norm we learn as drivers is that anything within ten miles per hour of the posted limit is okay but as a matter of lawwhich is what matters for the suppression issueif youre even one mile per hour over thats sufficient to pull you over write you a ticket and if the officer chooses to arrest you neither arbitrariness nor pretextual motive is relevant to the validity of the stop if it is based on probable cause that you were in fact violating the traffic law jay z explains the line as another way of saying that were being pulled over for no good reason as numerous commentators have observed the number and scope of traffic regulations is so extensive that the police can in practice find a perfectly legitimate traffic law basis for stopping any car they choose just by following it for a few blocks j lines 1315 step out of the car we now turn to the suspects interaction with the officer during a traffic stop in the song jay zs protagonist refuses the cops order to get out i aint stepping out of shit in the video he remains in the car and the cop backs off well this is a basic question the sort a criminal lawyer can answer does a driver actually have the right to refuse an order to exit the vehicle during an ordinary traffic stop unfortunately for drivers the answer here is an unequivocal no straight from the supreme court nce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a traffic violation the police officers may order the driver to get out of the vehicle without violating the fourth amendments proscription of unreasonable searches and seizures so the order to step out of the car is per se lawful the lack of suspicion of anything beyond the traffic offense is irrelevant indeed in mimms the case just quoted the government conceded that there was no suspicion of any kind other than the traffic violation and that it was simply the officers practice to order the driver out of the car whenever he made a traffic stop are you carrying a weapon here things get even worse for the drug smuggler terry v ohio allows for a weapons patdown any time legitimate police activity puts an officer in close proximity to someone if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person may be armed and dangerous reasonable suspicion is less than probable cause and courts tend to allow the usual training and experience boilerplate so long as there are specific articulable facts that give rise to the suspicion a later case michigan v long extended the terry rationale to vehicle stops allowing for a frisk of the car itselfthat is a search of the car for readily available weapons the rationale there is that if the person is a criminal he might well grab a gun and shoot you when you let him back into his vehicle after patting him down i know a lot of you are jay z comments that this is another statement with racial overtones that he and i are both aware of yes indeed race is always lurking in the background of the reasonable suspicion determination youre not going to put it right in your report but its always there on the facts of this song i would say that most courts would find reasonable suspicion primarily based on the suspects age his gender his attire his vehicle and the location all the officer would have to say is i had reasonable suspicion that the suspect could be involved in drug trafficking and based on my training and experience i know that drug traffickers habitually carry weapons heres an illustration i show my students from a law enforcement message board its one cops analysis of a situation very much like the one shown in the video when you want to get into a car how often do you use terry as justification for a search of weapons i was on a stop not too long ago that went something like this me and my partner are situated in a high crime drug area when we see a white male who fits the profile of a tweaker and two black males sitting in a car at a gas station known for drug activity we just sit there and think tweaker they pull off towards a street thats known for selling tweak and we follow they suddenly make a u turn when they spot us and then run a red light which we then pull them over driver is nervous and he doesnt really know his passengers conflicting statements abound pull them out of the car and then i ask the driver is it ok to check the vehicle he says no you cant search my vehicle i say ok and tell my partner to start checking the vehicle for weapons does this narrative describe sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a terry stop as you can see a lot of work is being done by the hearsay assertions high crime drug area profile of a tweaker profile of a tweaker car gas station known for drug activity and street known for selling tweak this sort of training and experience boilerplate is notoriously hard to refute and its acceptance by the courts serves as an almost per se invitation to search people who live in actual high crime neighborhoods so in the videowhich is set in bed stuythe officer could per mimms definitely order jay z out of the car and thus arrest him if he fails to comply he could likely then legitimately pat jay z down for weapons per terry and search the inside of the car for weapons per long that likely depends on whether he can make specific articulable observations about their demeanor appearance and behavior two caveats tip the scales a little bit back toward jay z however first the car frisk would not include the trunk nor would it include drilling into the ceiling in search of a concealed compartment its a search for readily available weaponsnot a search for contraband second it will not be as easy to justify the terry or long frisks out on the shoulder of the new jersey turnpike because the high crime neighborhood boilerplate wont be available k line 16 do you mind if i look around cops are trained to ask for consent and almost everyone gives it consent is useful for them because voluntary consent renders moot any other problems that might arise with the search furthermore awareness of the right to refuse is not a prerequisite to a voluntary consent to search a suspect who thinks he has no choice can nonetheless give voluntary consent as a matter of law searches in this respect are unlike statements under miranda a statement made during custodial interrogation will be presumed involuntary if not preceded by the required warning which includes telling the suspect that he has the right to remain silent but seven years after miranda the court considered adopting such a warning regime for consent searches and declined to do so the court said that street encounters with the police are inherently less coercive than jailhouse interrogation i find the courts reasoning unpersuasive for a lot of people street encounters and traffic stops are still pretty coercive but who cares what i think thats the law the burden is on the public to be aware of its rightsin this case the right to decline consent as a rule of thumb think of it this way if the police have the authority to search theyll just search if they have to get your consent its because they dont have the authority to search unless you consent so a good response to memorize is i do not consent if the cop asks to search without threatening you and you give consent you are flat out of luck even if you had no idea that you had the right to refuse l lines 1722 and i know my rights so you gon need a warrant for that if this essay serves no other purpose i hope it serves to debunk for any readers who persist in believing it the myth that locking your trunk will keep the cops from searching it based on the number of my students who arrived at law school believing that if you lock your trunk and glove compartment the police will need a warrant to search them i surmise that its even more widespread among the lay public but its completely 100 wrong there is no warrant requirement for car searches the supreme court has declared unequivocally that because cars are inherently mobile it is reasonable under the fourth amendment for the police to search the carthe whole car and everything in the car including containerswhenever they have probable cause to believe that the car contains evidence of crime you dont have to arrest the person or impound the vehicle you just need probable cause to believe that the car contains evidence of crime so in any vehicle stop the officers may search the entire car without consent if they develop probable cause to believe that car contains say drugs all the action in short is about probable cause warrants never come into the picture the fact that the trunk and glove compartments are locked is completely irrelevant now jay z may have just altered the for dramatic effect but that would be unfortunate insofar as the song is going to reach many more people than any criminal procedure lecture and everyone should really know the outline of the law in this area what the line should say is youll need some p c for that given that weve established that jay z is not under arrest and given that the terry frisk of the car is limited to accessible places a weapon could be hidden the trunk is definitely off limits at this point what that means is that if the officer opened the trunk by force without developing articulable probable cause the contraband found inside would be suppressed that is the point of the next line m line 23 well see how smart you are when the k 9s come a sniff by a drugsniffing dog is not a search for purposes of the fourth amendment dog sniffs are sui generis the court has heldtheyre unique in that they dont reveal any information about the contents of the object sniffed except the presence of contraband as to which you have no privacy right thus if the police have a dog ready to sniff your car when they pull you over for a traffic violation you have no basis for objecting to the sniff and of course if the dog does alert to the car that is probable cause so the police can then search the whole car thats what the officer wanted to do with jay z but the k 9 unit wasnt there when he was pulled over and was late arriving and this brings us to the final legal issue implicated by the song excessive prolongation of a traffic stop a traffic stop is a legitimate seizure of the person for purposes of investigating the violation of the traffic law and writing up the citation but it cannot be prolonged for longer than reasonably necessary to complete that legitimate activity if in fact the patrol cars computer is slow so you have to sit there for ten minutes while the cop runs your license thats one thing but increasingly given dashboard cameras and records of department computer activity that sort of delay is getting harder to fudge and the fourth amendment rule is very clear if the police detain you after theyve finished processing the ticketor if they simply dawdle over the ticket processing for an unreasonable length of timein order to get a k 9 team there then the eventual dog sniff will be the fruit of an illegal detention and any evidence found will be suppressed the officer in jay zs case apparently knew this and so released jay z after the stop when the k 9 unit hed called was late in arriving of course if during the traffic stop you provide the officer with reasonable suspicion that youre smuggling then the traffic stop becomes a terry stop for the purpose of investigating the suspected smuggling and then it can be extendednot indefinitely but for a few minutes anyway depending on the circuit courts will uphold reasonable suspicion for all the usual reasonsbut there still has to be something beyond the traffic stop itself this is a crucial distinction that all cops and perps need to be aware of and be prepared to litigate the best practice for law enforcement if youre planning to use traffic stops to make drug busts is to have the dog unit there when you make the initial stop but drug dogs and their handlers are valuable commoditiesthe dogs take a long time to train are expensive to house and typically work only with a designated officer so there arent as many k 9 units available as there are potential pretext traffic busts to make in a given night the cops in jay zs case could have rolled the dice on holding him there until the unit arrived but this is always a cost benefit game what are the chances that ill actually find something and what are the chances itll be suppressed if i do find it and also what are the chances that if i intentionally violate someones rights ill get in trouble on the last question the prevalence of cell phone cameras video sharing sites and departmental policies on dashboard cameras and body recorders for officers have worked a huge cultural shift in most departments and youre not going to have qualified immunity for intentionally prolonging a traffic stop to allow the dog to arrive the laws much too clear for that n line 24 i got 99 problems but a bitch aint one jay z says that the bitch in this line which recurs in the chorus refers to the late arriving drug dog not to a woman iii concluding advice the lesson for cops is that if you want to use traffic laws as a pretext for catching drug smugglers you can absolutely no problem but you have to do it right and doing it right can be labor intensive if youre out to get some smuggling busts have the dog unit ready if you dont have a dog on scene and the suspect doesnt give you consent then make as specific a record as you can of anything suspicious if you dont have anything its still not game over just arrest for the traffic violation and impound the vehicle and run a dog on it in the lot this means time off the street paperwork and potentially getting chewed out by your boss if you dont turn up contraband but it also means your bust will stick if the car was loaded this is almost always good advice ive heard it from my bosses and ive given it myself when in doubt arrest call it in and let the lawyers deal with it the lesson for perps is threefold dont consent know the reasonable suspicion boilerplate and dont provide it and make a record of the encounter any way you can including your behavior appearance and demeanor before and during the stop the officers stated motive for the stop all of your responses to questioning whether or not you were placed under arrest and the exact amount of time you were held on the side of the road and finally most importantly for both sideswhen in doubt talk to a lawyer my doors always open to players on both sides of this game call me footnotes associate professor of

butt with the massive shoe from chattanooga to malibu some of you won t realize what you have to do until you get left back in the rapture and your skin is rapidly turning black and blue when your back is cracked in two wishing the lord is who you could tap in to but you laugh at the facts and clues and rejected the holy ghost like you had a boo spiritual warfare left you with a rash or two and

fences instead of petitions i drink the blood and eat the flesh of christ the bread of afflictions symbolizing the fact that yeshua was dead but has risen next on the list is to settle the kids and tell them this vision the word of god will make your mouth sharper than pelican kisses listen but you can know the word and go to hell as a witness and christ will throw away your card like some irrelevant business confess him as lord and savior and believe that yes he was risen obey commandments and repent then your already forgiven yes replace the holy text with that machete was sitting no more traveling with death it s time rest on your pivot i know cats the die in their dreams and make they bands for a living softer of the sexy linen following the steps of they women too many women

don t judge me i got angels that praise the lord with flaming swords right above me i saw his face before i faced the lord not for money but rather to take the poor and pray for more if they get hungry i firmly believe that the word you received is to be heard and believed the firm that achieved to feed the birds and the trees heard what you screamed we hurt and we bleed so why you nervous there s a purpose unseen will be purged and be cleaned rebirthed in a stream the curtain is green i m certain it means you ll be learning to read and you learned to believe the purpose redeemed but the curtain is red well i m certain it means you re burdened to leave you murdered your dreams cause you curse and you fiend and lurk in between spirit and flesh but on the day that you die you ll be

i won t be burning in that flame when he comes and cracks the plain sky when he comes and cracks the plain sky come and crack the plain sky i mma meet him in the sky i gotta make a promise to every

the mind of hollis homie what you think you knowledged you ain t even finished college homie dang i never claimed to be a know it all but i know the one who knows it all so here we go stand against my bars you might be the victim but if you stand behind my bars you might be convicted i pray you feel what this fresh prince is pitching in i don t bank on skill cuz his will s what i m living in but no matter what character you fit me in i still went from dark to light like vivian his grace fits you like a cardigan and that should make you do the carlton but we just want a mili see god should make us tremor but we fall like trevor cuz we dumb like hillary man you should join the church we ain t half bad but you just never come around like a bad dad i quote the word of god and you just make a mad dash you put yourself before the word you a hash tag sorry i had to press you homie we just want to know who s in your network homie who you connected to who you doing life with but that s ok cuz we gon link you with the right clique you need to be around some people you can fight with cuz the law trying to beat you like a night stick but christ fulfilled the law so sin no longer has a hold god is in control of the fight script so i m praying that you bow down i pray you hear him all around you like surround sound every knee shall bow might as well bow now that s why my face is to the ground now but um life has been amazing since i joined the team people think this music is a field of dreams but flame told me everything ain t what it seems so let me take ya ll behind the scenes verse 2 they say what s it like since you signed with clear sight the same really i m just learning more about real life like it s christian rapper cats are still about the money ironic how on clear sight i m seeing twenty twenty our music never moves forward man that must sting but we never flex cuz we forts up plus we never focus on what drives them and maybe that s the reason they don t core us well flash back 2008 to json s life on life that album was great he had this song fight asked me to write a verse friends told me json ll make you rewrite a verse they told me homie write your verse like it s grind time said he make somebody write they verse five times so i wrote my verse sixty hope that he feel it he hit me up like i love your verse michael kill it now i m gassed like a b p album dropped and now i m feeling like i m top three read the credits and it said featuring mike guess that s what i get for letting pride lead beautiful eulogy he had to humble me no propaganda but i m back up on my humble beast cuz pride tries to slide in subtly i read the word then it stung me like a bumble bee but then it helps me transform like bumble bee so when i reach my optimus prime i won t walk around feeling like a megatron and then fall like decepticons  life has been amazing since i joined the team people think this music is a field of dreams but flame told me everything ain t what it seems so let me take ya ll behind the
