am who i am it s life really that made me my parents awareness careless drunk crazy high sober damn i keep changing growing knowing nothing could ever save me the gift of desperation i m in a hurry to die i draw it then i cross it i finish my starting line my supply i supply i fear it i can t deny this is time what is time i m tested invested mine in these rhymes in these lines i m destined won t be denied in decline intertwined the center attention i m so defined i m refined more money i m making mine f whatever n talking and thinking i m reading minds seeing i m just the same no different i m just specific insistent i get resistant malignant i am the sickness i suffer no buffer older but look younger starving i know hunger under and up and comer encumbered and torn asunder i m splintered tempered by mentors my n they all remember i m wrong but i m a writer and liver drowned my liver in bottles of malt liquor delivered didn t consider i m bitter but a success a mess i must confess this rap s out of control no longer underground we simply digging a hole i no longer feel connected no mind body or soul i detest don t contest it s no longer a goal this is life what s the meaning with meeting i feel alone the writings on the wall graffiti i can t decode this is death depth dollars and dreams the four d s and no 40 s this here is all me i am anti interviewer alright no doubt who or what inspired you to do music man how you got started black liquid you know what i m saying the whole way i got started is simply just failure though you know like you go through adversity you have people that inspire you to rhyme and sing everything else freestyle etc etc but one way or another you have to decide your own path and like i came to a point where i had a transverse and i was like from the classroom to red room for headroom i was born to stand up no leg room i record then perform i stopped knocking on doors and built my own building f waiting on yours no remorse no recourse of course they want rapport but there s more to invest and best it s nothing less than stress i obsess express but i m repressed impressed when i address i dress but here s the catch these people so distracted they d rather settle for less i m not a turn up rapper but i ll turn a rapper to rest respect retrospect regardless reassess real recognize real i ve yet to regress as an artist kept an

eat they thought but never think doesn t matter to me i m here until i m gone but this here is forever my presence is gravity i m not worried bout pressure and i prefer the pain it s the burden of the pleasure i am anti  interviewer how do you feel you know what i m saying your style and your music is different from other artists black liquid you know what i m saying the difference between my s and everybody else s is that my s is not contrived honesty i live this s this n last night came through me down and saying broke down to me how real one of my tracks is because it represents exactly who i

the worms in a box that s pine but now my eyes are open and suddenly i m feeling fine i m laying down and everything around me so dark i start to move and try to get up see if i can still walk i feel my head has bumped into something that feels wooden must be locked inside a coffin it s probably the place i m put in begin to panic i frantically start to pound the box scared as shit and yelling for somebody to come and let me out nobody can hear me i m buried lost inside the cemetery and no one knows i m alive so nobody s worried i feel this surge of energy then incredibly impossibly i knock six feet of dirt from off of top of me now standing alone in the graveyard in pouring rain i yell in triumph while lightning strikes the dark terrain last night while dreaming of dark matter the walls of my reality crashed and begin to shatter and when i opened my eyes my life was ripped and tattered must be the dark matter must be the dark matter my memories hazy damn my complexion s pasty how did i resurrect and who s the one that fucking raised me what am i even saying i must be going crazy babbling about resurrections but something weird has changed me what s with this hooded cloak why am i wearing this why did my family dress me like i m a lord of the sith i need some time to think and figure this out is that some people coming they see me they scream and they shout and now i got to get away from this place i start to running but i notice that i m moving at a startling pace faster and faster i just don t understand and plus i didn t even notice what appears to be a scythe in my hand i jump over the fence and land about a hundred yards away in a street in front a truck that s quickly coming my way i guess my instincts took over started swinging the scythe to my surprise it rips the truck in half with only one slice last night while dreaming of dark matter the walls of my reality crashed and begin to shatter and when i opened my eyes my life was ripped and tattered must be the dark matter must be the dark matter  i cant believe he lied to me im captured in this cage was amery a game i see im hurt and so enraged injected me its dark matter running through my veins im busting out and killing anyone whos in my range im feeling sick i see a chip and dig it out my arm i need to get the fuck up out of here theyve set alarms i gotta sneak and duck and peak because i am unarmed i see a jeep and then i speed back to where i belong the gas is gone my head is spinning think that this is it but then i find a little house and hide out for a bit i write upon this wall with my blood what i admit then in walks an assailant man i swear they never quit i hit him in the head with a block until he died i see his blood spillings i consume to stay alive and then begins the visions i can see his every crime dont want to feel the evil but i need it to survive my pen is a weapon they all scatter dont want to be a villain i kill them to heal faster receive the memories of my enemies right after must be the dark matter must be the dark matter addicted to venomous blood splatter i try to walk away dont give into the brain chatter the evils what i crave im climbing the

in the place where we live we ve got no where to go pushbikes on the road we take flight with the crows the night sky above and tarmac below us the city lights are majestic off in the distance over the roof tops we float above the dreams of a suburban night we snuck out while my parents slept take a ride and we we ride our bikes to the bay take a walk of the wharf sit on the edge and light a ciggie like a torch you turn and you talk to me i m looking away i m listening to every single thing that you say you say the future s bright man tomorrow is ours and there will come a day soon where we leave this town the clouds they start to gather and we get up and leave and we re home before the dawn even touches the trees i m saying it s more than with your own life you are playing and i understand you my friend i ve fucked up too but i m just saying i m just saying we always said that these suburbs were like cemetery you always said you d escape that s what you said to me you got away not in the way that you thought now i m walking down old tracks and i m looking for yours and in the middle of similar looking scenes as i step off from the gutter and gather the things i need midnight light makes the night life look lifelike the antennas and tennis courts this town is menopause and yeah i know my way around and i could play it down the streets are like the back of my hand and memories abound but now it s different i m different the difference is that i visit i don t stick around i don t even miss it i get a vision of a version of my highschool days most weekends you would spend at my place your face is in these streets and it haunts me now that s why i struggle when i head homebound  you always had your own rhythm to keep the comedy coming you were as close as a brother man i think of you often how you talked with a passion how you rationed you cash you stood six foot tall above the rats you had a habit of thinking you were the smartest motherfucker in the room and it was generally true on the real you were a hero a friend of the highest order a companion when the girls that we chased were all we thought of whoever you are wherever you re from we all get given time then it s time to move on one day you re in the midst of it the next you are gone and if you think it s different to that you re wrong life s an addiction we re all in the nod and it s a beautiful dream so dreamer dream on breathe in remember everything from the start the end is the beginning the beginning is past first thing i noticed was just how thin you d got hot the powerful
