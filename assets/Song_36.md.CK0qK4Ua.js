the true message i am sending out here now we do have two kinds of fires going on i have a fire and you had a fire cause you see your fire has just about burned out it could be that you been flicking your bic so much elsewhere until you done run out of fuel now i don t know this all i know is this house is cold there hasn t even been any ashes in this fireplace recently and i am about to add a third fire an outside fire now this fire has not yet started because i thought you should know the consequences of getting a fire started on the outside now i am not talking about dropping a lil lit match somewhere on a wet day i am talking bout burning down a whole damn county smokey the bear would hate me after this now only you can prevent this forest fire you can start by getting the fire started right here i don t mean just one of them little smoke signals cause your name ain t geronimo now either you do this or there gonna be enough sparks flying around here that the whole neighborhood gonna think its the 4th of july cause i m declaring my independence my right for a man to offer me a tipparillo oh yes i m gonna be smoking now i know you don t want this to happen cause once you get an outside fire started you can t control it every time you think you ve just about smothered it a good gust of wind come through and set that mickey dickey on fire again and you could end up with a wildfire and wildfires do have a tendency to spread oh no don t think you can start a fire across town and its gonna stay over there if you mess around and get burnt its gonna beat you home ain t no need to be telling your old lady nothing bout i can t do nothing this week baby i was lifting something down too heavy at the job and i got a strain no buddy the strain gonna be on your ass cause you done messed around and let these outside fires heat your house and when an outside fire spread all the way to your house ooh lord you wake up one morning and your house is on fire building collapsing down around your ass and you in trouble i ain t bullshitting you in trouble boy i m talking about the heat is on mmmhmmm oh yeah and when that much heat get in your house niagra falls couldn t put that mickey dickey out and strange things start happening around the house and then you come home one day lo and behold there s a different kind of log in the fireplace a log bigger than yours a longer log than yours and it just burns for hours even after the log burned down the coals stay lit then you know your ass in trouble its time for you to gather your twigs and split now i wanna tell you something hear me this is what is about to happen in our situation i been checking out the logs in the neighborhood nice logs in fact there s a whole god damn forest out there and i am ready with my axe to chop down the first tree i see baby i want you to know this so what i suggest you do here if you wanna keep these home fires burning is do like they do when they go downtown

everything we could have done differently is now just a memory and the love i hoped for is hanging on a rope and it s funny how artistic we become when our hearts are broken through this constant collapse the thought of relapse i guess it s safe to throw our bones back in the sea i guess it s safe to throw our bones back in the sea with this saltwater for blood and fear of falling in love i m almost happy here but i m still moving i just want us to run wild young beauty because i always thought i would be okay and some days i still feel the same but every day the same way i feel afraid to embrace grace cause i know i don t deserve it and i know that i can t earn this and i know that i can hurt this heart that i have grown within but it s a given to even someone as sick as me now i can breathe seeing that i m not living in apathy so i guess we ll throw our bones back into the sea i guess it s safe to throw our bones back into the sea come with me and i hope i stay alive because ghosts can t love through this broke love and turn to above in a quick dash feel the impact on this car crash and pray to god i can be forgiven and have my friends back where we sleep is where we dream and i haven t slept for days rem cycles are a memory of when i was sitting in a dorm room thinking of how much greener the grass would be if i became a touring act someday but now i m dreaming or sinking most nights they feel the same since i can lose one friend lose all friends and still not keep those demons at bay and i said all my friends are trees with the roots in the earth what hurts is that the branches in a community we ve labeled our hearts into a collective scene into a collective faithless dream of empty courage and empty hearts hollow light hollow lovers always falling apart so i ll love life and let go and try my best to understand there s nothing new to know though i didn t say it s true i still feel the same like i died with you and i feel the strain taking two steps

into their sphere of possession of the trees of birds hung havens hangars people go by things go by a horse drawing a buggy breaking his hollow iron music on the asphalt a loud auto a quiet auto people in pairs not in a hurry scuffling switching their weight of aestival body talking casually the taste hovering over them of vanilla strawberry pasteboard and starched milk the image upon them of lovers and horsemen squared with clowns in hueless amber a streetcar raising its iron moan stopping belling and starting stertorous rousing and raising again its iron increasing moan and swimming its gold windows and straw seats on past and past and past the bleak spark crackling and cursing above it like a small malignant spirit set to dog its tracks the iron whine rises on rising speed still risen faints halts the faint stinging bell rises again still fainter fainting lifting lifts faints foregone forgotten now is the night one blue dew now is the night one blue dew my father has drained he has coiled the hose low on the length of lawns a frailing of fire who breathes parents on porches rock and rock from damp strings morning glories hang their ancient faces the dry and exalted noise of the locusts from all the air at once enchants my eardrums on the rough wet grass of the back yard my father and mother have spread quilts we all lie there my mother my father my uncle my aunt and i too am lying there they are not talking much and the talk is quiet of nothing in particular of nothing at all the stars are wide and alive they seem each like a smile of great sweetness and they seem very near all my people are larger bodies than mine with voices gentle and meaningless like the voices of sleeping birds one is an artist he is living at home one is a musician she is living at home one is my mother who is good to me one is my father who is good to me by some chance here they are all on this earth and who shall ever tell the sorrow of being on this earth lying on quilts on the grass in a summer evening among the sounds of the night may god bless my people my uncle my aunt my mother my good father oh remember them kindly in their time of trouble and in the hour of their

couche dans mon lit je me recueille en toi mon dieu des larmes de gratitude m inondent parfois le visage et c est ma prire would it all be absurd or might it make some kind of sense i ve made myself sick wondering about it i awake in the morning just the way millions do millions of boys girls infants and old men their slumber dissipated forever these millions those slumbers have no meaning a hidden meaning hidden yes obviously but if nothing has any meaning there s no point in my doing anything i ll beg off i ll use any deceitful means to get out of it in the end i ll have to let go and sell myself to meaninglessness nonsense that is man s killer the one who tortures and kills not a glimmer of hope left but if there is a meaning today i don t know what it is tomorrow tomorrow who can tell me am i going to find out what it is no i can t conceive of any meaning other than my anguish and as for that i know all about it and for the time being nonsense monsieur nonsense is writing and understands that he is mad it s atrocious but his madness this meaninglessness how serious it has become all of a sudden might that indeed be meaningful my life has only a meaning insofar as i lack one oh but let me be mad make something of all this he who is able to understand it he who is dying and there the living self is knowing not why it s teeth chattering in the lashing wind the immensity the night engulfs it and all on purpose that living self is there just in order not to know but as for god god if he knew would be a swine he would entirely grasp the idea but what would there be of the human about him beyond beyond everything and yet farther and even farther still himself in an ecstasy above emptiness cognitive activity god comes to be known in ways that originate in god solely god is nothing if he is not in every sense the surpassing of god in the sense of common everyday being in the sense of dread horror and impurity and finally in the sense of nothing he is mystery indeed he is the absolute mystery divine disclosure is in direct proportion to the degree of divine concealment intensification of revelation equals to increasing of god s hiddenness descent of the deus absconditus vere tu es deus absconditus the unreservedly open spirit open to death to torment to joy the open spirit open and dying suffering and dying and happy stands in a certain veiled light that light is divine and the cry that breaks from a twisted mouth may perhaps twist him who utters it but what he speaks is an immense alleluia flung into endless silence and lost there shall my only victory be available in conscience why is absence the proof when i demand palpable presence there is enough light to enlighten the elect and enough darkness to humble them there is enough darkness to blind the reprobate and enough clarity to condemn them and make them without excuse our perception is subject to the fissure of concupiscence woestruck am i realising that the light cast on this chiaroscuro world is partial and selective division election and predestination enabled by grace or left to one s own device anguish is only sovereign absolute the sovereign is a king no more it dwells in low biding in big cities it knits itself up in silence obscuring its sorrow crouching thick wrapped there it waits lies waiting for the advent of him who shall strike a general terror but meanwhile and even so its sorrow scornfully mocks at all that comes to pass and all there is from very high above a kind of stillness swept down upon me and froze me it was as though i were borne aloft in a flight of headless and unbodied angels shaped from the broad swooping of wings but it was simpler than that i became unhappy and felt painfully forsaken as one is when in the presence of god she was seated she held one leg stuck up in the air to open her crack yet wider she used fingers to draw the folds of skin apart and so her old rag and ruin lured at me hairy and pink just as full of life as some loathsome squid why i stammered in a subdued tone why are you doing that you can see for yourself she said i m god no use laying it all up to irony when i say of here that she is god but god figured as a public whore and gone crazy that viewed through the optic of philosophy makes no sense at all i don t mind having sorrow derided if derided it has to be he only will grasp me aright whose heart holds a wound that is an incurable wound who never for anything in any way would be cured of it and what man if so wounded would ever be willing to die of any other hurt if there is nothing that surpasses our powers and our understanding if we do not acknowledge something greater than ourselves greater than we are despite ourselves something which at all costs must not be then we do not reach the insensate moment towards we strive with all this is in our power and which at the same time we exert with all our power to stave off i can utter no word o my god unless i be permitted by thee and can move in no direction until i obtain thy sanction it is thou o my god who hast called me into being through the power of thy might and hast endued me with thy grace to manifest thy cause the act whereby being existence is bestowed upon us is an unbearable surpassing of being an act no less unbearable than that of dying and since in death being is take away from us at the same time it is given to us we must seek for it in the feeling of dying in those unbearable moments when it seems to us that we are dying because the existence in us during these interludes exists through nothing but a sustaining and ruinous excess when the fullness of horror and that of joy coincide as i waited for annihilation all that subsisted in me seemed to me to be the dross over which man s life tarries diabolus absconditus the conjunction of intellect and psychotropic altered senses supported by insistent and archaic sounds credit for tremendous revelation goes in all humility to g
