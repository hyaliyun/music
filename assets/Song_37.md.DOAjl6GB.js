child i could picture him while living curly hair protruding lips i d seen perhaps a thousand in my hurried southern trips then rose a sad old colored preacher from his little wooden desk with a manner sort of awkward and countenance grotesque the simplicity and shrewdness in his ethiopian face showed the wisdom and the ignorance of a crushed undying race and he said now don t be weepin for this pretty bit of clay for the little boy who lived there has done gone and run away he was doing very finely and he ppreciates your love but his sho nough father wanted him in the big house up above

rivals make it hard for us to do this so everybody got a gun but when we was younger our only weapon was our two fists now who missed the first lesson in life don t be no punk if you a man have heart be a savage whether you sober or drunk i seen niggas in the pen getting their ass dug out over some hop or a pack of kamels but thats the game home boy and every move you make is a gamble them squares

been yearning for surpassing my trauma to cast away my past battles blasting off to nirvana verse 1 take your time in life but don t you ever waste it cuz all it takes is one second for your ways to shake it you started strong and set a pace until your brain erased it suddenly and left you with your fear and anger still adjacent so where s the bait that you were falling for and where s that number that solemnly swore you would call your mama more it s all revoked and its toll s taken to start a war to spar with all the parts that bring darkness inside my heart s core on this dark stormy night while it was pouring i left my porch lit my torch and started exploring setting forth a metamorphosis i was soaring through a lapse of time laughing til the night became the morning snoring never i was wide awake with the breeze of mother nature breathing on me through the leaves of her trees leaning on me while she whispered all her secretive pleas and said i chose you for the lead role in keeping the peace so be at ease hook i said i love you but i gotta go cuz i ve been jotting down my thoughts and got a lot to show i found the truth but yo there s still a lot i gotta know and

for surpassing my trauma to cast away my past battles blasting off to nirvana verse 2 every step i take s a recipe for questing and every sweat i break s a reminder i m never resting so where s my next adventure that s a reoccurring question circling my brain to scorch the pain embroidered in my lesson i sorted out my thoughts blossomed to cop knowledge got lost and came real close to dropping out of college i still might but for now i m off of the wall with a collar popped to say i m confident for stopping my fall through all of my wrongs this will be the time to be right red dot upon my goals when i m aligning my sight i m a zombie in the day but come alive in the night when the world is dark and i can recognize the parts that are bright a survivor and a fighter i strive to reside in solitude until my mind is ripe with the wisdom i need to follow through so while i m walking i want you to know i ll watch for you to help you spot the cues for your destiny when it calls on you hook i said i love you but i gotta go cuz i ve been jotting down my thoughts and got a lot to show i found the truth but yo there s still a lot i gotta know and staying in the same spot would mean that i could never grow so i mma walk along the path that i wanna while i m sweating out my stress like i was trapped in a sauna on my journey i ve been yearning for surpassing my trauma to cast away my past battles blasting off to nirvana bridge motherfucker you gotta march through rain sleet snow and shine you gotta march towards the happiness you re bound to find and when it s dark too many folks forfeit their ride and i won t let you get forced to decide hook i said i love you but i gotta go cuz i ve been jotting down my thoughts and got a lot to show i found the truth but yo there s still a

birds but not like stones i tuck my soul in my socks and hide my heart in my pockets born alone die alone s the only thing you re promised born alone born alone born alone born alone die alone die alone die alone die alone cause it s a shitty thing to say and a sad way to think so i write inside this pad until my pen runs out of black ink spilling my soul until i run out of things to say cause
