were formally we re not ill we ve been trying to stay young we re trying to preserve ourselves like those sexy man boys that you saw ten years ago on the tv um cause we know that people don t like characters that they know from television to get older i think to them it s disturbing i mean it s difficult for us to see you cause you re older as well but the lights are quite dark so it s quite flattering on you guys yeah but us being up here and we remind you of your own i guess your own mortality sorry about that having said that let s enjoy the fleeting moment yes the time we have left let s try and have a good time yeah anyway you see how fast it s going yeah it s gone it s great to be here in london this is a bit of a reunion gig for us uh we haven t played since last night and it s just great to have the whole band here um we don t know if you ve heard these jokes you might be exactly the same people we re one of the biggest bands in new zealand now uh in terms of the number of members yeah yeah we re a two person band most bands in new zealand are one person bands um you ve probably heard of john jemaine rob bret lucy lucy s great yeah yeah brilliant it s a very good band even our national orchestra s a one man band it s very when we combined we formed the super group bret used to be in a band didn t you my old band was called the bret and yeah and jemaine was your band was called what the jemaine and no it was jemaine and the no one else that s right yeah how we got together was we were billed on the same night at the same time by accident and most of our songs have the same chords anyway so we just sang at the same time and that s how we wrote a lot of our songs yeah and that s how this electricity got started bret yeah yeah that s right we re gonna do some songs this next one is uh it s another du et um and it it s kind of groundbreaking for us um because we re really challenging the gender stereotypes that exist uh within the band and and for those of you who know some of our songs i often play the ladies in our songs and and you do it well bret you do it well thank you uh but this next song we re doing a gender reversal reversal so what we usually do is we gender reverse it so bret s the lady but we ve reversed it back on itself full 360 till he s back to a man yeah yeah he s very excited to be playing the very macho ian a guy called ian a british a very um it s a very macho name he s a very macho sexual british guy mm and jemaine takes the role of deanna yeah uh it s an office place romance and she s a very complex character a lot of layers that you ve put in there yeah i ve put in two layers i ve added another dimension to what i usually do to make a fully two dimensional character yeah uh i ve really embraced the role i ve studied a woman that s right and i just watched little things she did it s like this kind of thing you ll see that come you ll see it i won t do it now save it save it i ll save it for the performance when you see me become deanna you ll see it oh it s a transformation yeah thank you thank you but one last detail um before we do play the song it s just you know i think we want to point out that we are aware that comedy is a very male dominated industry unfortunately you know we re writing the roles for women but um the problem is the band itself is very male dominated and it s systemic yeah it s it s systemic a systemic problem it s the fucking patriarchy that s what it is yeah so we re sorry about that but we re trying we re trying yeah yeah what too fast what do you think

it once you have it then it s gone now some never see beyond these walls and some never see those worms that crawl but mind your step or you will trip on pride s fall trust no man if his head above all stance still like the world on pause eased breath of a wind pre storm firm grasp let the blade conform manifest thy will transform become sword unsheathed cut raw become myth turned life real lore meet the rage on the field of war but never drink of the blood that pours look upon ruin and behold these ways when you remove that leash then you ll end the dog days only by hand can you turn that page only keys of integrity unlock that cage if you swim in foul play you will live among plague if you cut a man s spirit he will bleed just the same when you linger in the desert don t expect to find rain and if you wish to know peace you must come to know pain every pioneer leaves a home of the brave every last deed has a seed that remains and with every backlash some are shocked and afraid but you will never see the light if you refuse to leave shade this that jewel of the master steady wins the race though impatience run it faster turn to face the dragon as it brews your disaster ride upon its back breathing flames with a rapture in this world only victory or capture never sleep until that reaper come and snatch ya and you can t starve with a belly full of laughter learn to take risk so reward can come after we all the same but ain t no two of us alike and when push come to shove you abstain from the fight receive the match of life but then decline to ignite that s what the

do recall a gypsy lady and a younger man in over his head i was her believer taken in by every loving word she said it was there for the first time the sweet and the bitter taste of love when you re young and alive too much never seems to be enough it seems the young and the innocent are drawn like a moth to a flame to the wild and the reckless believing they are one in the same she never found a way to separate the good from the bad and she never understood that love was all we ever really had she was right for the time but time has a way of moving on with her eyes on tomorrow one day she turned around and i was gone i d have to say in a way she just might be better off alone she was right for the time but time has a way of moving

how to handle some very legitimate beef so without further ado here s your host the j to the o ha ha ha thanks for the introduction so funk volume fans i cant rap right well i bet you the next one hundred and ten bars say otherwise and let me start by showing you how to address somebody with less fans than fans than you im about to eat and pleasantly shit out shizzy sizzle and the little niggy tickles so i guess i did it for shits and giggles you found a way to elicit my rage all your little short bus fans posting your bullshit diss on my page so you like to skateboard i like to sit and think what i hate more your stupid fucking face your lisp or your braids im sorry shizzy but i had to mention with that lisp your whack ass could take first in the special rap olympics you re uglier than swizz s ass go kiss in his cage you two go together like jarren benton s dick and some aids why am i dissing you hey i aint too much of a prideful coward bitch to acknowledge some shit when it sprays funk volume more like punk volume i been slapping them silly and they just sit and take it like bitches for days look at them shaking in the corner sharing their body warmth while the almighty hopsin sits and gets rich from his slaves i think its funny that your fans think im not raw when everyone of y all kissed my ass dj hop saw but hes a two face pretentious pussy pop doll with hopsin s hot sauce covered cock and lock jaw look at these punks trying to play dope you faggots are faker than a pack of drag queens on a parade float its time to let you bitches know im so reel i should be stuck to a fishing pole listen this is punk volume hey you can run you can hide but cant escape from the vibe im giving you punk volume look around and youll see theyre all living a lie and i m telling you why yo its never gonna stop on and on ill go until the whole world hears it and they all will know that punk volume is going down in flames at the end of the night and im telling you why  yo so hopsin s the greatest rapper alive right i bet you if you scratch his black off youll probably get a 1999 bright blond hair blue eye white new guy with five spice girls sitting next to dr dre saying hi right let s put the facts together he aint a rapper hes the worlds biggest blackest marshall mathers swagger jacker ever its fucking sad but clever every single thing he does eminem did ten years in the past and better hes just a big clone somebody took white contacts and stuck them on a slim shady dip cone and eminems own fans kids were just stoned enough for it to work now he s dancing in the end zone look at this leech bitch preaching against reefer while swizzz jarren and dizzy khalifa sit and get blown hits home doesn t it bitch go on and push me i got hours of audio that confirms youre a pussy its funny as fuck watching your fans trying to defend you and deny all the allegations i filed against you and you said it with your own words i was like a brother who discovered your only loyal to those that benefit you i was there when you were broke and nourished you helping you flourish pursue your true purpose encouraged and asserted you but when it came time to go to bat for me you jumped ship and gave me some cash and told me keep it on the hush tip like what the fuck bitch money cant erase the pain of your best friend punching you right in your fucking face and you only apologize when i turn the heat on and dames like hes gone let by gones be peons were funk volume we dont need him fuck jokerr he mad he just wants to use you to get fans he wishes he had and what im using you too pfft thats some crazy shit remember when you couldnt pay your rent and i came and gave you it remember when you tossed your deal with ruthless out the window and all your little homies disappeared when you went broke when everybody else left me and swizzz would still kick it duh marcus what the fuck you think youre their meal ticket youre more naive than a battered wife you think dame would ve given you a fucking cent if you were half as nice you think if you were just some dude hed sacrifice his time to help you get back your life ha ha ha right like when you met that good girl who was so fine knew that you were a famous rapper but paid it no mind you almost cried hop dont lie remember when you discovered she was sneaking off and smoking the whole time and you fucking stayed with her like i said no spine and shes nine years younger than you bro whoa lines and youre supposed to be a christian shit dont be surprised if jesus shows up and kicks your dick youre a fraud the lowest of the low kind you sell your fans bullshit and they all sniff it like a coke line if thats how you want it bro fine ill show you how far im willing to go with this shit in no time this is punk volume hey you can run you can hide but cant escape from the vibe im giving you punk volume look around and youll see theyre all living a lie and i m telling you why yo its never gonna stop on and on ill go until the whole world hears it and they all will know that punk volume is going down in flames at the end of the night and im telling you why hey yo this last verse is for the fans you idolize these mother fuckers youre like putty in their porkish hands and first they do it for the love til you fork em grands then theyre like eh this works fuck it abort the plan you wonder why your favorite rappers all start out dope then start to suck ass when they stepped in the corporate land cause when the money comes they toss integrity out the window when you keep buying the shit and support the scam but im a big hater yeah im the bad guy for standing up and telling you they re selling you a fat lie they hold up a turd and tell you its gold and your ass buys i tell you it s a turd and walk away with black eyes you think i diss cause im upset you think i diss cause im just a big hater and mad cause i aint make it yet well let me tell you something all these dudes that you respect are greedy cowards and only look at you as human checks i knew hopsin before the fame i loved him like a brother and he fucking hated dame so what made him change the money that he says hes hates he turned over control of his company to a snake now he cant escape and you let him do it you never told him no you still buy the records you still go to shows you know it isnt right you can feel it inside but someone famous said it was so you compromised and you shoot the messenger cause all you think i do is hate and call me a pussy in clown makeup while you chew the bait huh when all i did was give it to you straight and stood the fuck up to dame when he threw his weight so ask yourself am i the nerdy queer who s just jealous funk volume had a perfect year or am i the only one who respects you enough to tell you all the truth even if it hurts to hear hopsin was like a brother to me i would have done anything for him and when it came time to have my back he took sides with the same person who was trying to destroy me because he makes hopsin money he used to stand against everything funk volume is doing now but he fell in love with the money and fame and now he sits there like a coward while you guys defend his bullshit when he said out of his own mouth he hates what funk volume has become but there s too much money involved to walk away from it so i why do i diss i diss cause i dont look at you like a money bag i diss because unlike hopsin i look at you as intelligent individuals who deserve to know the truth about the people youre supporting my loyalty is to you and theyre fucking lying to you and anybody lying to you has a permanent enemy in me if you hate me for that i dont know what to tell you

pitched a fever and i m not on some knock you out when i see you shit either i m not really bitter i m not really mad i just need to cordially address some issues that i had see you ve been a big fan and i appreciate it greatly but a subtle annoyance has been boiling as of lately if imitation is the greatest compliment you can give well frankly i m all complimented out my nig see i got up at the diss game as a true right of passage i m passed giving out frivolous ass lyrical actions you think you the biggest nigga on the block you can test it in certain cases merit it neccessary to oppress it as an example this is a case where jokerr was patient in trying to nurish you as an artist and hoping you make it but you ve been insisting on spitting it back in his face and there s not much of that shit he takes for jokerr to brace it it started back when your first album was being crafted i made the comment i frollick naked through cactus patches it wasn t but a week later you came back with it written back into one of your verses and spit it without even asking i found it intrusive but screw it i needed the cash and you were paying me like 250 a track back when you snatched it you sneaky bastard you were a rap jacking felon i should ve listened to the little voice in my head telling me  don t show kavy if you re ill and he knows homie just be careful what you disclose he ll listen and smile but wish all the while that your were his and then he ll act on it oh ho kavy oh how i hate what you ve done to make me say you are a fake and a sponge you re a rapper but i don t know if you ll make it as one i m sorry homie take it and run yo alledgedly you write disses for every rapper you spit with just incase they double cross you and you need to be defensive well guilty artist suspicions my nigga let s get it cracking let s see your best shot without your boy the jokerr backing see there s noone in your sessions so noone sees me catching all your inconsistent phrasings and me helping you correct them it s really not an issues and i m happy to assist you i just wish you d quit fishing and just appreciate the blessing now you shower me with mentions every hour of our kinships but as a convient distraction to your cowardly infringements and every self respecting rapper knows that s a symptom of a jealous ass fella hiding bellows of resentment now i understand you re frightened and the difficulty writing when you re recording your albums in the shadow of a titan but remember i m a storm full of lightning and i ll strike at ya you re bitings equivalent of skipping naked flying kites in it i gave you plenty chances you gave the same excuses that i thwarted you then resorted to blatant playing stupid you backed me in the corner and you made the jokerr do this you betrayed me and now i feel like the saviour choking judas so if anyones to come across a copy of this track if you could keep it to yourself that d be optimal in fact listen once flip it over and scratch it with keys i just don t want him stealing lines to diss me back with so please now he s come to the conclusion of my thorough ego bruising i d just like to note to all involved this wasn t of my choosing i was put in this position jokerr just needed to vent this is rap intervention i hope that you see and repent see we all love you we just sick of you biting niggas there s programs

certain enough of this in the past 14 years there s only one girl i ve kissed in the blistering heat of the asbury pier we sat quiet as monks on the ferris wheel until looking down at the waltzer and out at the sea i asked her do you ever have that recurring fantasy where you push little kids from the tops of the ride and she shook her head no i said oh neither do i and with my grandma s ring i went down on one knee and the subsequent catastrophe has since haunted me like a fiberglass ghost in the attic my inconveniently selective memory as provisionally you mercifully withdrew all the bearing points we thought we knew day s run days set plot our compass shot we sailed waywardly on singing our midnight archer songs until well past dawn it s still dark in the deck of our boat haphazardly blown broken bows our aimless arrow words don t mean a thing so by now i think it s pretty obvious that there s no god and there s definitely a god i dreamt of the rocks at the asbury dunes and that you jumped from the top of the log flume and they gather like wolves on the boardwalk below and they re howling for answers no wolf can know i charged at the waves with a glass in my hand i was tossed like a ball at the bottle stand and i landed beside your remains on the stones where your cold fingers wrapped round my ankle bones maybe ten feet away was a star thousands of times the size of our sun exploding like the tiny balloons you d throw darts at i slept until our chest was full of yarn we spun from shetland wool in socks from where the dorset grows sheared and scoured

the wrong group again with myself and who else and a bunch of dead men who wanna see my name on a headstone finally motherfucker i can be alone tell my woman just to visit me from time to time and

and don t shoot in the sky his eyes will widen up and aim right between those eyes when he drops don t run stand over him and feel him die and if anyone youre unsure abouts around they gotta go too or his family finds out and you have people youve never seen coming to kill you and i don t care who you are and if you care or not youre looking over your shoulder at every passing car you could be shot and once youve felt that stress life doesn t get to you not anymore not after what weve been through and i no longer bother to ask father to forgive me i ve been fighting all my life theres no fight left in me every day i wake up ready to die but when i turn the gun on myself all i see is your big eyes and i ve hurt you so much i can t do it one more time so i grind my teeth together and i try to unwind but time doesn t move when youre sitting in this spot and i m trapped in this body with this soul i don t want and i think at night i cut myself to sleep because i wake up and i m stuck to my sheets and i don t recall what happened was it me was it possession i have scars appear in my skin after dreams where are my big eyes where am i i ve lost my place at home by your side i ve been trapped in that killing field boy where its carry a gun or die and cocksuckers wanna know how i m still alive i had to kill to get here boy so next time you try know i was baptized in blood and gun

the dumpster behind the 7 11 mom brought the bottle inside and set it down on top of the tv then she told all of us kids to gather round and then she explained how jesus lived in the bottle and how if she wanted to she could call him out to do her bidding sis said it reminded her of an old tv show and mom slapped her and called her a heretic i didn t say anything cause i just still remember the time outside the safeway when it took four security guards to hold mom down jesus loves me yes i know for the bible tells me so when i m weak he makes me strong that s why i sing this song if i die before i wake pray to him my soul don t take jesus loves me yes i know it wasn t long before people from all over the world started coming to our house to see the bottle at first i thought that this would make me more popular at school instead it seemed to have the opposite result kids would stop and point at me in the hallway and say there s the boy whose mother keeps our savior cooped up in that tiny little bottle and then everybody started calling me bottle boy and that really hurt it was also around this time that mom began to attract some really weird followers like that guy who never used deodorant and spoke only in riddles and that woman who collected 19th century hand made amish swimwear jesus loves me yes i know for the bible tells me so when i m weak he makes me strong that s why i sing this song if i die before i wake pray to him my soul don t take jesus loves me yes i know mommy she loved jesus but not like others did for she had a special bottle in which our savior lived mommy she loved jesus but not like others did for she could unleash his vengeance by unfastening the lid as the year went on things went from bad to worse and i realized that if there wasn t a big change pretty soon i d never be able to get a date for the prom i couldn t go the year before because mom belonged to a church that considered dancing a one way ticket to hell but that s a whole nother story anyway by this point mom had appeared on the richard bey show a m philadelphia and geraldo so there was no use in me changing schools since everybody knew who my mom was also we had to spend all the money from mom s personal appearances to hire a bodyguard since by this point we were getting about 400 death threats a day jesus loves me yes i know for the bible tells me so when i m weak he makes me strong that s why i sing this song if i die before i wake pray to him my soul don t take jesus loves me yes i know then one night i just couldn t stand it any more while everyone else was sleeping i crept downstairs slowly i went up to the bottle and began to unfasten the lid at first nothing happened but then the room filled with a thick white smoke i was glad my sister had taken the batteries out of the smoke detector to put into her walkman when the smoke cleared i found myself face to face with the son of god who was much shorter than i had expected he told me that since i d freed him he d grant me one wish and that s how i got to go to the prom with geena davis but you probably already read about that in people jesus loves me yes i know for the bible tells me so when i m weak he makes me strong that s why i sing this song if i die before i wake pray to him my soul don t take jesus loves me yes i know mommy she loved jesus but not like others did for she had a
