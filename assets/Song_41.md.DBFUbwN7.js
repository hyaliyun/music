longer did i taste the recycled air jumping in and out of my lungs this breath belonged to me for the first time i could feel the links of every chain that tied me down to reality being broken one by one this isnt the kind of freedom my president speaks about this is real the exhilaration of this foreign feeling had made me utterly oblivious to the fact that my eyelashes had become hundred pound barbells determined to deal my eyelids shut i struggled to form a sentence as the words i m good dripped out of my mouth barely making it past my teeth had i known this was my last statement i would have attempted to put it more eloquently the world as i knew it slowly faded to black as i fell into an infinite slumber welcome to the dream the second you turn that last page is the beginning of your new life you re just taking your first breath these are your first thoughts congratulations you ve successfully completed the first portion of being you this is where the fun starts as of right now you officially have no past everything prior to this moment will no longer be affecting your present in any way you are now everything you want to pursue you are every personality trait you admired and most importantly you are in charge i strongly encourage you to act thing speak and participate like never before however there are some key ingredients to ensure the success of this new life you must know what you want you must believe without a doubt you will obtain it i understand this can sound somewhat intimidating and i know some people have no idea what they want right now well i m here to let you know that the sooner you figure it out the better this includes relationships occupation happiness heath financial well being and everything in between you can always add more to the list as you go along but consider the things you enjoy in life most and focus on those start thinking you can literally get anything you want if every thought is paired with a sense of affirmation for example instead of saying i want to be happy say i am happy it s all about the act of doing and being in pursuit it s time to look in the mirror and see everything you desire it will take imagination and self control but we have all been given both those things for free let s start the dream one of my favourite pieces of advice is if you want a new car go test drive it see what it s like to get behind the wheel of your dream car the smell of the leather grip of the tires and purr of the engine hold these things very close to you think about them the power of new environment this tool is the compas on the journey to finding yourself do new things and go to new places as a touring musician i wake up in a new state everyday for months at a time people who ve never seen my face or heard my me speak constantly surround me i m free to allow my chameleon like soul to take on any desired personality trait we have no past to those we haven t met when people don t have a preconceived idea of who we are we can let go of what we don t want to be and become whomever we intend on being sometimes it may become necessary to leave behind people or things that are holding us back from the destiny we are creating meeting new people is like a slingshot thrusting you towards this new you duce yourself just simply say hello not too long ago i redesigned every aspect of my existence i decided i was going to be the most enjoyable person possible for people to be around that s where it all started it was simple all i had to do was be fun i d walk into every room and introduce myself to everyone in it i d deliver every handshake with a smile no matter what i was going to leave that room with a bunch of new friends after a very short time doing this i began to see its effects people started to tell me how much more enjoyable life was and how much better they felt with me in the same room my happiness was not only doing wonders for me but for everyone around me as well we are all here to be happy at that exact moment i was reborn i realised how simple it was for everything you are to become everything you were we are extremely powerful and control everything about ourselves you have the ability to shed unwanted layers of skin and become brand new right now chapter 2 bright side of a dark moment the power of positivity have you ever wondered why right now is called the present it s because it s the greatest gift anyone could receive you re alive you woke up this morning and that s a reason to celebrate i credit all my happiness and successes to the power of the mind saying it s powerful is somewhat of an understatement we were once prehistoric un evolved creatures who knew absolutely nothing then one day we discovered fire and everything changed then another day we invented the wheel and everything changed again before you knew it we developed and entire civilisation and here we are that s powerful but what we re about to discuss goes far deeper than those layers of the mind the brain is a muscle and like a bicep the more you use it the stronger it gets it contains so much infinite ability and power we can t even understand how to acces its entirety everything that happens in your life was born first within your mind you may not know it but you re creating your own identity right this very second every thought that enters your head also leaves it the universe is taking orders from your mind 24 hours a day 7 days a week you re solely responsible for everything great in your life you re also responsible for everything you wish didn t happen as well the universe is always listening and it s time to take advantage of that you don t have to be careful what you wish for but you should be full of care do not be weary or neglect your thoughts think all the time just make sure you want what you re thinking about what first turned me on to this way of thinking and living is the law of attraction this law simply states your mentality is your reality no matter who you are your mind has a direct connection to the universe and as individuals we personally choose how to embrace that now the next thing i share with you will prove to be a turning point in the creation of the rest of your life the universe is completely unbiased let s say someone is speeding down the highway in a car and suddenly sees red and blue lights flashing in the rear view mirror they pull off to the side of the road and get issued a speeding ticket i hate speeding tickets the driver reacts i never want another speeding ticket again it appears that the driver just expressed a dislike for speeding tickets but it s actually quite the contrary the only thing the universe heard is the driver say speeding ticket two times the universe is unbiased and doesn t pay attention to words like want or don t want all it hears is the focus of your words and thoughts the universe believes we want everything we think about so think about what you want i receive messages daily from people telling me that they were the law of attraction for a couple weeks and it was working really well but then suddenly the bad days took over again i tell everyone the exact same thing the challenge is the best part every challenge is the universe s way of letting you know you re on the right track the universe is a teacher and as we learned in school to reach the next level you must pass the test you must prove that when faced with rain you can still shine bright once you pass the test you move on to the next level of your relationship with the universe eventually after successfully enduring these challenges the universe begins to hand you nothing but good fortune have you ever heard the saying its always darkest before dawn this is true though there s more to it than that you will be challenged but once your sun comes up it doesn t ever have to go back down those bad days are actually prepelling you towards a series of never ending good ones that is if you deal with them correctly prove to the universe you can stand up to any unfortunate event be thankful when the unexpected happens because now you have the chance to exercise the ability to shine even a situation as devastating as someone s death has a light of positivity of course we miss them dearly but they were here and we were fortunate enough to share moments with them our memories made and memories left will live on forever not only is the universe always listening it s watching too simple good deeds like picking up trash or helping an elderly woman cross the street don t go unnoticed personally i accept all organised relations as possibilities but choose not to conform to any i do however exercise a form of karma daily i like to call it the circle every action we make is a single dot that will eventually connect itself and form a circle each good decision will be reintroduced to another good decision somewhere down the line that also means each bad decision will reappear as well there are so many opportunities to earn an extra credit in this world most of these opportunities will involve the way you interact with other people each one of us shares this planet with nearly 7 billion other human beings although i d live for everyone to think the same way i do about positivity i just can t expect for it to be that way all the time the world is built off of interactions with others and quite honestly if everyone were the same there would be no need for any of us it s very important to realise that if the opposite of what you believe in didn t exist you d have nothing to believe in without bad we wouldn t know what to call good without lies we wouldn t know what truth is always be accepting we need the opposite and it needs us thinking positive will always lead to a better outcome a great example is by simply looking up literally walk outside and look up the sky is endless and filled with possibility now look down no matter where you are you will see an ending below you decide whether or not to look up or down at every situation that occurs let unexpected incidents roll off you like rain drops dancing down your bedroom window now if a negative thought pops into your head head that doesn t mean you re doing something wrong negative thoughts may happen but it s all about how you deal with them","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

of my way before you willfully and joyously disobeyed before you betrayed the gift that i gave of that breath in your lungs that life in your airways by saying no to my love and yes to your heresy before you engaged with the enemy waged in sin with intensity before you de reigned my supremacy inflamed my jealousy before you chose greed over my adequacy lies over my accuracy pride over my

run away from my call i am the truth before you could ever walk away from my law i am the life before you could ever turn away from my cross at golgothas skull and so i beg you now to withdraw withdraw from your sin for i am your only temptation withdraw from your self for i am making you a new creation withdraw from your pride for i am ruining your reputation withdraw from your self righteousness for i am your only mediation withdraw from your hopes and dreams for i am your only expectation withdraw from your life for i am your crucifixion for before all time i am all sufficient

in the end i grab the pen cause what gets me off my mattress it s music the love is deep mood it s everlasting it follows me from the cradle to the casket pure satisfaction gathering my soul shattered fragments at times man i wish i was illiterate then i couldn t read all the letters that i slipping through my letter slit nothing but bills using in aggressive rhetoric saying give us the dough or we got other means to settle it and just as i get to thinking that i ll better quit i start practicing verbs nouns adjectives and predicates and when i m in that zone you best to step back a bit

when the crowd starts shivering yo it s not because they re cold it s the quivering because i spoke with authenticity i m not religious but music gave me an epiphany particle purified dafuniks bringing the best beats all for now until i fill out another fresh sheet oh no it s happening again trouble sets in waiting for the dividends no doubt that making dollars make sense but it really

gathering my soul shattered fragments now there s some people telling me i d better stop and concentrate on my 9 to 5 til my ticker pops to be or not that s the question to you it s bigger rocks and bigger tongues and bigger cracks then play the biggest spots i go from note to note concentrate to connect the dots beginning at the bottom pushing my way to the top sometimes i got some food for thought in my dinner box for now i just let it flow like the river does trying to make the reflection something the mirror loves cos for too long the mirror reflected the kid who fought for recognition missing out cause he partied so hard fun is good in moderation but sometimes it is all you have and then it s that time again to grab your balls stand up for your true love and watch the dominoes fall a chain reaction main attraction is the music y all so i make sure to pick up the phone when dafuniks call  oh no it s happening again trouble sets in waiting for the dividends no doubt

prose satire and criticism who most potently of all the men of his time affected the subsequent course of english letters such was ben jonson and as such his strong personality assumes an interest to us almost unparalleled at least in his age ben jonson came of the stock that was centuries after to give to the world thomas carlyle for jonson s grandfather was of annandale over the solway whence he migrated to england jonson s father lost his estate under queen mary having been cast into prison and forfeited he entered the church but died a month before his illustrious son was born leaving his widow and child in poverty jonson s birthplace was westminster and the time of his birth early in 1573 he was thus nearly ten years shakespeare s junior and less well off if a trifle better born but jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage his mother married beneath her a wright or bricklayer and jonson was for a time apprenticed to the trade as a youth he attracted the attention of the famous antiquary william camden then usher at westminster school and there the poet laid the solid foundations of his classical learning jonson always held camden in veneration acknowledging that to him he owed all that i am in arts all that i know and dedicating his first dramatic success every man in his humour to him it is doubtful whether jonson ever went to either university though fuller says that he was statutably admitted into st john s college cambridge he tells us that he took no degree but was later master of arts in both the universities by their favour not his study when a mere youth jonson enlisted as a soldier trailing his pike in flanders in the protracted wars of william the silent against the spanish jonson was a large and raw boned lad he became by his own account in time exceedingly bulky in chat with his friend william drummond of hawthornden jonson told how in his service in the low countries he had in the face of both the camps killed an enemy and taken opima spolia from him and how since his coming to england being appealed to the fields he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the arm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his jonson s reach may have made up for the lack of his sword certainly his prowess lost nothing in the telling obviously jonson was brave combative and not averse to talking of himself and his doings in 1592 jonson returned from abroad penniless soon after he married almost as early and quite as imprudently as shakespeare he told drummond curtly that his wife was a shrew yet honest for some years he lived apart from her in the household of lord albany yet two touching epitaphs among jonson s epigrams on my first daughter and on my first son attest the warmth of the poet s family affections the daughter died in infancy the son of the plague another son grew up to manhood little credit to his father whom he survived we know nothing beyond this of jonson s domestic life how soon jonson drifted into what we now call grandly the theatrical profession we do not know in 1593 marlowe made his tragic exit from life and greene shakespeare s other rival on the popular stage had preceded marlowe in an equally miserable death the year before shakespeare already had the running to himself jonson appears first in the employment of philip henslowe the exploiter of several troupes of players manager and father in law of the famous actor edward alleyn from entries in henslowe s diary a species of theatrical account book which has been handed down to us we know that jonson was connected with the admiral s men for he borrowed 4 pounds of henslowe july 28 1597 paying back 3s 9d on the same day on account of his share while later on december 3 of the same year henslowe advanced 20s to him upon a book which he showed the plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the company at christmas next in the next august jonson was in collaboration with chettle and porter in a play called hot anger soon cold all this points to an association with henslowe of some duration as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon mere promise from allusions in dekker s play satiromastix it appears that jonson like shakespeare began life as an actor and that he ambled in a leather pitch by a play wagon taking at one time the part of hieronimo in kyd s famous play the spanish tragedy by the beginning of 1598 jonson though still in needy circumstances had begun to receive recognition francis meres well known for his comparative discourse of our english poets with the greek latin and italian poets printed in 1598 and for his mention therein of a dozen plays of shakespeare by title accords to ben jonson a place as one of our best in tragedy a matter of some surprise as no known tragedy of jonson from so early a date has come down to us that jonson was at work on tragedy however is proved by the entries in henslowe of at least three tragedies now lost in which he had a hand these are page of plymouth king robert ii of scotland and richard crookback but all of these came later on his return to henslowe and range from august 1599 to june 1602 returning to the autumn of 1598 an event now happened to sever for a time jonson s relations with henslowe in a letter to alleyn dated september 26 of that year henslowe writes i have lost one of my company that hurteth me greatly that is gabriel for he is slain in hogsden fields by the hands of benjamin jonson bricklayer the last word is perhaps henslowe s thrust at jonson in his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual continuance at his trade up to this time it is fair to jonson to remark however that his adversary appears to have been a notorious fire eater who had shortly before killed one feeke in a similar squabble duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among gentlemen and the nobility it was an impudent breach of the peace on the part of a player this duel is the one which jonson described years after to drummond and for it jonson was duly arraigned at old bailey tried and convicted he was sent to prison and such goods and chattels as he had were forfeited it is a thought to give one pause that but for the ancient law permitting convicted felons to plead as it was called the benefit of clergy jonson might have been hanged for this deed the circumstance that the poet could read and write saved him and he received only a brand of the letter t for tyburn on his left thumb while in jail jonson became a roman catholic but he returned to the faith of the church of england a dozen years later on his release in disgrace with henslowe and his former associates jonson offered his services as a playwright to henslowe s rivals the lord chamberlain s company in which shakespeare was a prominent shareholder a tradition of long standing though not susceptible of proof in a court of law narrates that jonson had submitted the manuscript of every man in his humour to the chamberlain s men and had received from the company a refusal that shakespeare called him back read the play himself and at once accepted it whether this story is true or not certain it is that every man in his humour was accepted by shakespeare s company and acted for the first time in 1598 with shakespeare taking a part the evidence of this is contained in the list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of jonson s works 1616 but it is a mistake to infer because shakespeare s name stands first in the list of actors and the elder kno well first in the dramatis personae that shakespeare took that particular part the order of a list of elizabethan players was generally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in the company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of characters every man in his humour was an immediate success and with it jonson s reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time was established once and for all this could have been by no means jonson s earliest comedy and we have just learned that he was already reputed one of our best in tragedy indeed one of jonson s extant comedies the case is altered but one never claimed by him or published as his must certainly have preceded every man in his humour on the stage the former play may be described as a comedy modelled on the latin plays of plautus but the pretty story of the beggar maiden rachel and her suitors jonson found not among the classics but in the ideals of romantic love which shakespeare had already popularised on the stage jonson never again produced so fresh and lovable a feminine personage as rachel although in other respects the case is altered is not a conspicuous play and save for the satirising of antony munday in the person of antonio balladino and gabriel harvey as well is perhaps the least characteristic of the comedies of jonson every man in his humour probably first acted late in the summer of 1598 and at the curtain is commonly regarded as an epoch making play and this view is not unjustified as to plot it tells little more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to follow his supposedly studious son to london and there observe his life with the gallants of the time the real quality of this comedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are conceived ben jonson had theories about poetry and the drama and he was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with them in his plays this makes jonson like dryden in his time and wordsworth much later an author to reckon with particularly when we remember that many of jonson s notions came for a time definitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of english poetry first of all jonson was a classicist that is he believed in restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent ungoverned and irresponsible renaissance spirit jonson believed that there was a professional way of doing things which might be reached by a study of the best examples and he found these examples for the most part among the ancients to confine our attention to the drama jonson objected to the amateurishness and haphazard nature of many contemporary plays and set himself to do something different and the first and most striking thing that he evolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours as jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter let us quote his own words as to humour a humour according to jonson was a bias of disposition a warp so to speak in character by which some one peculiar quality doth so possess a man that it doth draw all his affects his spirits and his powers in their confluctions all to run one way but continuing jonson is careful to add but that a rook by wearing a pied feather the cable hat band or the three piled ruff a yard of shoe tie or the switzers knot on his french garters should affect a humour o it is more than most ridiculous jonson s comedy of humours in a word conceived of stage personages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion and placing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict and contrast struck the spark of comedy downright as his name indicates is a plain squire bobadill s humour is that of the braggart who is incidentally and with delightfully comic effect a coward brainworm s humour is the finding out of things to the end of fooling everybody of course he is fooled in the end himself but it was not jonson s theories alone that made the success of every man in his humour the play is admirably written and each character is vividly conceived and with a firm touch based on observation of the men of the london of the day jonson was neither in this his first great comedy a supine classicist urging that english drama return to a slavish adherence to classical conditions he says as to the laws of the old comedy i see not then but we should enjoy the same licence or free power to illustrate and heighten our invention as they did and not be tied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few who are nothing but form would thrust upon us every man in his humour is written in prose a novel practice which jonson had of his predecessor in comedy john lyly even the word humour seems to have been employed in the jonsonian sense by chapman before jonson s use of it indeed the comedy of humours itself is only a heightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life viewed at a satirical angle and is the oldest and most persistent species of comedy in the language none the less jonson s comedy merited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in which comedy long continued to run to mention only shakespeare s falstaff and his rout bardolph pistol dame quickly and the rest whether in henry iv or in the merry wives of windsor all are conceived in the spirit of humours so are the captains welsh scotch and irish of henry v and malvolio especially later though shakespeare never employed the method of humours for an important personage it was not jonson s fault that many of his successors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated that is degrade the humour into an oddity of speech an eccentricity of manner of dress or cut of beard there was an anonymous play called every woman in her humour chapman wrote a humourous day s mirth day humour out of breath fletcher later the humourous lieutenant and jonson besides every man out of his humour returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies in the magnetic lady or humours reconciled with the performance of every man out of his humour in 1599 by shakespeare s company once more at the globe we turn a new page in jonson s career despite his many real virtues if there is one feature more than any other that distinguishes jonson it is his arrogance and to this may be added his self righteousness especially under criticism or satire every man out of his humour is the first of three comical satires which jonson contributed to what dekker called the poetomachia or war of the theatres as recent critics have named it this play as a fabric of plot is a very slight affair but as a satirical picture of the manners of the time proceeding by means of vivid caricature couched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that righteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true satire as a realisation in short of the classical ideal of comedy there had been nothing like jonson s comedy since the days of aristophanes every man in his humour like the two plays that follow it contains two kinds of attack the critical or generally satiric levelled at abuses and corruptions in the abstract and the personal in which specific application is made of all this in the lampooning of poets and others jonson s contemporaries the method of personal attack by actual caricature of a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama aristophanes so lampooned euripides in the acharnians and socrates in the clouds to mention no other examples and in english drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again what jonson really did was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an art and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a dramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency with the arrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in scorn vituperation and invective it is no wonder that jonson soon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with his fellow authors the circumstances of the origin of this poetomachia are far from clear and those who have written on the topic except of late have not helped to make them clearer the origin of the war has been referred to satirical references apparently to jonson contained in the scourge of villainy a satire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by john marston a fellow playwright subsequent friend and collaborator of jonson s on the other hand epigrams of jonson have been discovered variously charging playwright with scurrility cowardice and plagiarism though the dates of the epigrams cannot be ascertained with certainty jonson s own statement of the matter to drummond runs he had many quarrels with marston beat him and took his pistol from him wrote his poetaster on him the beginning of them were that marston represented him on the stage the best account of this whole subject is to be found in the edition of poetaster and satiromastrix by j h penniman in belles lettres series shortly to appear see also his earlier work the war of the theatres 1892 and the excellent contributions to the subject by h c hart in notes and queries and in his edition of jonson 1906 here at least we are on certain ground and the principals of the quarrel are known histriomastix a play revised by marston in 1598 has been regarded as the one in which jonson was thus represented on the stage although the personage in question chrisogonus a poet satirist and translator poor but proud and contemptuous of the common herd seems rather a complimentary portrait of jonson than a caricature as to the personages actually ridiculed in every man out of his humour carlo buffone was formerly thought certainly to be marston as he was described as a public scurrilous and profane jester and elsewhere as the grand scourge or second untruss of the time apparently we must now prefer for carlo a notorious character named charles chester of whom gossipy and inaccurate aubrey relates that he was a bold impertinent fellow a perpetual talker and made a noise like a drum in a room so one time at a tavern sir walter raleigh beats him and seals up his mouth with hard wax from him ben jonson takes his carlo buffone in every man in his humour is it conceivable that after all jonson was ridiculing marston and that the point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of the grand scourge or second untruss with the scurrilous and profane chester we have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify the difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the allusions in these forgotten quarrels we are on sounder ground of fact in recording other manifestations of jonson s enmity in the case is altered there is clear ridicule in the character antonio balladino of anthony munday pageant poet of the city translator of romances and playwright as well in every man in his humour there is certainly a caricature of samuel daniel accepted poet of the court sonneteer and companion of men of fashion these men held recognised positions to which jonson felt his talents better entitled him they were hence to him his natural enemies it seems almost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire through every man out of his humour and cynthia s revels daniel under the characters fastidious brisk and hedon munday as puntarvolo and amorphus but in these last we venture on quagmire once more jonson s literary rivalry of daniel is traceable again and again in the entertainments that welcomed king james on his way to london in the masques at court and in the pastoral drama as to jonson s personal ambitions with respect to these two men it is notable that he became not pageant poet but chronologer to the city of london and that on the accession of the new king he came soon to triumph over daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty cynthia s revels the second comical satire was acted in 1600 and as a play is even more lengthy elaborate and impossible than every man out of his humour here personal satire seems to have absorbed everything and while much of the caricature is admirable especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly satirical dialogue the central idea of a fountain of self love is not very well carried out and the persons revert at times to abstractions the action to allegory it adds to our wonder that this difficult drama should have been acted by the children of queen elizabeth s chapel among them nathaniel field with whom jonson read horace and martial and whom he taught later how to make plays another of these precocious little actors was salathiel pavy who died before he was thirteen already famed for taking the parts of old men him jonson immortalised in one of the sweetest of his epitaphs an interesting sidelight is this on the character of this redoubtable and rugged satirist that he should thus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little theatrical waifs some of whom had been literally kidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped to the conning of their difficult parts to the caricature of daniel and munday in cynthia s revels must be added anaides here assuredly marston and asotus interpreted as lodge or more perilously raleigh crites like asper macilente in every man out of his humour is jonson s self complaisant portrait of himself the just wholly admirable and judicious scholar holding his head high above the pack of the yelping curs of envy and detraction but careless of their puny attacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect the third and last of the comical satires is poetaster acted once more by the children of the chapel in 1601 and jonson s only avowed contribution to the fray according to the author s own account this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that his enemies had entrusted to dekker the preparation of satiromastix the untrussing of the humorous poet a dramatic attack upon himself in this attempt to forestall his enemies jonson succeeded and poetaster was an immediate and deserved success while hardly more closely knit in structure than its earlier companion pieces poetaster is planned to lead up to the ludicrous final scene in which after a device borrowed from the lexiphanes of lucian the offending poetaster marston crispinus is made to throw up the difficult words with which he had overburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary in the end crispinus with his fellow dekker demetrius is bound over to keep the peace and never thenceforward malign traduce or detract the person or writings of quintus horatius flaccus or any other eminent man transcending you in merit one of the most diverting personages in jonson s comedy is captain tucca his peculiarity has been well described by ward as a buoyant blackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most complete exposure and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a walking dictionary of slang it was this character captain tucca that dekker hit upon in his reply satiromastix and he amplified him turning his abusive vocabulary back upon jonson and adding an immodesty to his dialogue that did not enter into jonson s conception it has been held altogether plausibly that when dekker was engaged professionally so to speak to write a dramatic reply to jonson he was at work on a species of chronicle history dealing with the story of walter terill in the reign of william rufus this he hurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by poetaster and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply the absurdity of placing horace in the court of a norman king is the result but dekker s play is not without its palpable hits at the arrogance the literary pride and self righteousness of jonson horace whose ningle or pal the absurd asinius bubo has recently been shown to figure forth in all likelihood jonson s friend the poet drayton slight and hastily adapted as is satiromastix especially in a comparison with the better wrought and more significant satire of poetaster the town awarded the palm to dekker not to jonson and jonson gave over in consequence his practice of comical satire though jonson was cited to appear before the lord chief justice to answer certain charges to the effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in poetaster nothing came of this complaint it may be suspected that much of this furious clatter and give and take was pure playing to the gallery the town was agog with the strife and on no less an authority than shakespeare we learn that the children s company did so berattle the common stages that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose quills and dare scarce come thither several other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less part in the war of the theatres among them the most important is a college play entitled the return from parnassus dating 1601 02 in it a much quoted passage makes burbage as a character declare why here s our fellow shakespeare puts them all down aye and ben jonson too o that ben jonson is a pestilent fellow he brought up horace giving the poets a pill but our fellow shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit was shakespeare then concerned in this war of the stages and what could have been the nature of this purge among several suggestions troilus and cressida has been thought by some to be the play in which shakespeare thus put down his friend jonson a wiser interpretation finds the purge in satiromastix which though not written by shakespeare was staged by his company and therefore with his approval and under his direction as one of the leaders of that company the last years of the reign of elizabeth thus saw jonson recognised as a dramatist second only to shakespeare and not second even to him as a dramatic satirist but jonson now turned his talents to new fields plays on subjects derived from classical story and myth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama so that shakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his julius caesar about 1600 therefore when jonson staged sejanus three years later and with shakespeare s company once more he was only following in the elder dramatist s footsteps but jonson s idea of a play on classical history on the one hand and shakespeare s and the elder popular dramatists on the other were very different heywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the stage in quick succession all derived from stories in ovid and dramatised with little taste or discrimination shakespeare had a finer conception of form but even he was contented to take all his ancient history from north s translation of plutarch and dramatise his subject without further inquiry jonson was a scholar and a classical antiquarian he reprobated this slipshod amateurishness and wrote his sejanus like a scholar reading tacitus suetonius and other authorities to be certain of his facts his setting and his atmosphere and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in the margin when he came to print sejanus is a tragedy of genuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste the story of the haughty favourite of tiberius with his tragical overthrow our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking representation of ancient roman life than may be found in jonson s sejanus and catiline his conspiracy which followed in 1611 a passage in the address of the former play to the reader in which jonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version has led to the surmise that shakespeare may have been that worthier pen there is no evidence to determine the matter in 1605 we find jonson in active collaboration with chapman and marston in the admirable comedy of london life entitled eastward hoe in the previous year marston had dedicated his malcontent in terms of fervid admiration to jonson so that the wounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed between jonson and chapman there was the kinship of similar scholarly ideals the two continued friends throughout life eastward hoe achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in a demand for three issues in one year but this was not due entirely to the merits of the play in its earliest version a passage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to his nation the scots sent both chapman and jonson to jail but the matter was soon patched up for by this time jonson had influence at court with the accession of king james jonson began his long and successful career as a writer of masques he wrote more masques than all his competitors together and they are of an extraordinary variety and poetic excellence jonson did not invent the masque for such premeditated devices to set and frame so to speak a court ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of elaboration long before his time but jonson gave dramatic value to the masque especially in his invention of the antimasque a comedy or farcical element of relief entrusted to professional players or dancers he enhanced as well the beauty and dignity of those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies took their parts to create by their gorgeous costumes and artistic grouping and evolutions a sumptuous show on the mechanical and scenic side jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in inigo jones the royal architect who more than any one man raised the standard of stage representation in the england of his day jonson continued active in the service of the court in the writing of masques and other entertainments far into the reign of king charles but towards the end a quarrel with jones embittered his life and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a constant irritation to each other but intolerable bores at court in hymenaei the masque of queens love freed from ignorance lovers made men pleasure reconciled to virtue and many more will be found jonson s aptitude his taste his poetry and inventiveness in these by forms of the drama while in the masque of christmas and the gipsies metamorphosed especially is discoverable that power of broad comedy which at court as well as in the city was not the least element of jonson s contemporary popularity but jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he turned to the amusement of king james in 1605 volpone was produced the silent woman in 1609 the alchemist in the following year these comedies with bartholomew fair 1614 represent jonson at his height and for constructive cleverness character successfully conceived in the manner of caricature wit and brilliancy of dialogue they stand alone in english drama volpone or the fox is in a sense a transition play from the dramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy represented in the plays named above its subject is a struggle of wit applied to chicanery for among its dramatis personae from the villainous fox himself his rascally servant mosca voltore corbaccio and corvino to sir politic would be and the rest there is scarcely a virtuous character in the play question has been raised as to whether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy for although the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the most vicious it involves no mortal catastrophe but jonson was on sound historical ground for volpone is conceived far more logically on the lines of the ancients theory of comedy than was ever the romantic drama of shakespeare however repulsive we may find a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the rogues and their dupes and identifying brains with roguery and innocence with folly admires the former while inconsistently punishing them the silent woman is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious construction the whole comedy hinges on a huge joke played by a heartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle who is induced to take to himself a wife young fair and warranted silent but who in the end turns out neither silent nor a woman at all in the alchemist again we have the utmost cleverness in construction the whole fabric building climax on climax witty ingenious and so plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the possibilities of life in the alchemist jonson represented none the less to the life certain sharpers of the metropolis revelling in their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the stupidity and wickedness of their victims we may object to the fact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of honesty is discomfited and that the greatest scoundrel of all is approved in the end and rewarded the comedy is so admirably written and contrived the personages stand out with such lifelike distinctness in their several kinds and the whole is animated with such verve and resourcefulness that the alchemist is a new marvel every time it is read lastly of this group comes the tremendous comedy bartholomew fair less clear cut less definite and less structurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors but full of the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree beyond any english comedy save some other of jonson s own it is in bartholomew fair that we are presented to the immortal caricature of the puritan zeal in the land busy and the littlewits that group about him and it is in this extraordinary comedy that the humour of jonson always open to this danger loosens into the rabelaisian mode that so delighted king james in the gipsies metamorphosed another comedy of less merit is the devil is an ass acted in 1616 it was the failure of this play that caused jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a period of nearly ten years volpone was laid as to scene in venice whether because of the success of eastward hoe or for other reasons the other three comedies declare in the words of the prologue to the alchemist our scene is london cause we would make known no country s mirth is better than our own indeed jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for collected publication in his folio of 1616 he transferred the scene of every man in his humour from florence to london also converting signior lorenzo di pazzi to old kno well prospero to master welborn and hesperida to dame kitely dwelling i the old jewry in his comedies of london life despite his trend towards caricature jonson has shown himself a genuine realist drawing from the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any generation a happy comparison has been suggested between ben jonson and charles dickens both were men of the people lowly born and hardly bred each knew the london of his time as few men knew it and each represented it intimately and in elaborate detail both men were at heart moralists seeking the truth by the exaggerated methods of humour and caricature perverse even wrong headed at times but possessed of a true pathos and largeness of heart and when all has been said though the elizabethan ran to satire the victorian to sentimentality leaving the world better for the art that they practised in it in 1616 the year of the death of shakespeare jonson collected his plays his poetry and his masques for publication in a collective edition this was an unusual thing at the time and had been attempted by no dramatist before jonson this volume published in a carefully revised text all the plays thus far mentioned excepting the case is altered which jonson did not acknowledge bartholomew fair and the devil is an ass which was written too late it included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty odd epigrams in which form of brief and pungent writing jonson was an acknowledged master the forest a smaller collection of lyric and occasional verse and some ten masques and entertainments in this same year jonson was made poet laureate with a pension of one hundred marks a year this with his fees and returns from several noblemen and the small earnings of his plays must have formed the bulk of his income the poet appears to have done certain literary hack work for others as for example parts of the punic wars contributed to raleigh s history of the world we know from a story little to the credit of either that jonson accompanied raleigh s son abroad in the capacity of a tutor in 1618 jonson was granted the reversion of the office of master of the revels a post for which he was peculiarly fitted but he did not live to enjoy its perquisites jonson was honoured with degrees by both universities though when and under what circumstances is not known it has been said that he narrowly escaped the honour of knighthood which the satirists of the day averred king james was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand worse men were made knights in his day than worthy ben jonson from 1616 to the close of the reign of king james jonson produced nothing for the stage but he prosecuted what he calls his wonted studies with such assiduity that he became in reality as by report one of the most learned men of his time jonson s theory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and an ability as he put it to convert the substance or riches of another poet to his own use accordingly jonson read not only the greek and latin classics down to the lesser writers but he acquainted himself especially with the latin writings of his learned contemporaries their prose as well as their poetry their antiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning though a poor man jonson was an indefatigable collector of books he told drummond that the earl of pembroke sent him 20 pounds every first day of the new year to buy new books unhappily in 1623 his library was destroyed by fire an accident serio comically described in his witty poem an execration upon vulcan yet even now a book turns up from time to time in which is inscribed in fair large italian lettering the name ben jonson with respect to jonson s use of his material dryden said memorably of him was not only a professed imitator of horace but a learned plagiary of all the others you track him everywhere in their snow but he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he fears not to be taxed by any law he invades authors like a monarch and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in him and yet it is but fair to say that jonson prided himself and justly on his originality in catiline he not only uses sallust s account of the conspiracy but he models some of the speeches of cicero on the roman orator s actual words in poetaster he lifts a whole satire out of horace and dramatises it effectively for his purposes the sophist libanius suggests the situation of the silent woman a latin comedy of giordano bruno il candelaio the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in the alchemist the mostellaria of plautus its admirable opening scene but jonson commonly bettered his sources and putting the stamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it thenceforward to all time current and his own the lyric and especially the occasional poetry of jonson has a peculiar merit his theory demanded design and the perfection of literary finish he was furthest from the rhapsodist and the careless singer of an idle day and he believed that apollo could only be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned and yet many of jonson s will live as long as the language who does not know queen and huntress chaste and fair drink to me only with thine eyes or still to be neat still to be dressed beautiful in form deft and graceful in expression with not a word too much or one that bears not its part in the total effect there is yet about the of jonson a certain stiffness and formality a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous and unbidden but that they were carved so to speak with disproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual thought is on greater things it is for these reasons that jonson is even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where rhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the spontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical poetry there are no such epitaphs as ben jonson s witness the charming ones on his own children on salathiel pavy the child actor and many more and this even though the rigid law of mine and thine must now restore to william browne of tavistock the famous lines beginning underneath this sable hearse jonson is unsurpassed too in the difficult poetry of compliment seldom falling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude yet showing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others a discriminating taste and a generous personal regard there was no man in england of his rank so well known and universally beloved as ben jonson the list of his friends of those to whom he had written verses and those who had written verses to him includes the name of every man of prominence in the england of king james and the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate familiarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth of the laureate in 1619 growing unwieldy through inactivity jonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to scotland on his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the houses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had recommended him when he arrived in edinburgh the burgesses met to grant him the freedom of the city and drummond foremost of scottish poets was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest at hawthornden some of the noblest of jonson s poems were inspired by friendship such is the fine ode to the memory of sir lucius cary and sir henry moryson and that admirable piece of critical insight and filial affection prefixed to the first shakespeare folio to the memory of my beloved master william shakespeare and what he hath left us to mention only these nor can the earlier epode beginning not to know vice at all be matched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and stately age but if jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his folio and up to the end of the reign of king james he was far from inactive for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness continued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court in the golden age restored pallas turns the iron age with its attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight in pleasure reconciled to virtue atlas figures represented as an old man his shoulders covered with snow and comus the god of cheer or the belly is one of the characters a circumstance which an imaginative boy of ten named john milton was not to forget pan s anniversary late in the reign of james proclaimed that jonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite and the gipsies metamorphosed displayed the old drollery and broad humorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable these too and the earlier years of charles were the days of the apollo room of the devil tavern where jonson presided the absolute monarch of english literary bohemia we hear of a room blazoned about with jonson s own judicious leges convivales in letters of gold of a company made up of the choicest spirits of the time devotedly attached to their veteran dictator his reminiscences opinions affections and enmities and we hear too of valorous potations but in the words of herrick addressed to his master jonson at the devil tavern as at the dog the triple tun and at the mermaid we such clusters had as made us nobly wild not mad and yet each verse of thine outdid the meat outdid the frolic wine but the patronage of the court failed in the days of king charles though jonson was not without royal favours and the old poet returned to the stage producing between 1625 and 1633 the staple of news the new inn the magnetic lady and the tale of a tub the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy none of these plays met with any marked success although the scathing generalisation of dryden that designated them jonson s dotages is unfair to their genuine merits thus the idea of an office for the gathering proper dressing and promulgation of news was an excellent subject for satire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers although as much can hardly be said for the magnetic lady who in her bounty draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile them in the end according to the alternative title or humours reconciled these last plays of the old dramatist revert to caricature and the hard lines of allegory the moralist is more than ever present the satire degenerates into personal lampoon especially of his sometime friend inigo jones who appears unworthily to have used his influence at court against the broken down old poet and now disease claimed jonson and he was bedridden for months he had succeeded middleton in 1628 as chronologer to the city of london but lost the post for not fulfilling its duties king charles befriended him and even commissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court and he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and devoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be sealed of the tribe of ben jonson died august 6 1637 and a second folio of his works which he had been some time gathering was printed in 1640 bearing in its various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642 it included all the plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs excepting the case is altered the masques some fifteen that date between 1617 and 1630 another collection of and occasional poetry called underwoods including some further entertainments a translation of horace s art of poetry and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would hardly have included himself these last comprise the fragment of a tragedy called mortimer his fall and three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic spirit the sad shepherd there is also the exceedingly interesting english grammar made by ben jonson for the benefit of all strangers out of his observation of the english language now spoken and in use in latin and english and timber or discoveries made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of his daily reading or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of the times the discoveries as it is usually called is a commonplace book such as many literary men have kept in which their reading was chronicled passages that took their fancy translated or transcribed and their passing opinions noted many passages of jonson s discoveries are literal translations from the authors he chanced to be reading with the reference noted or not as the accident of the moment prescribed at times he follows the line of macchiavelli s argument as to the nature and conduct of princes at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and poets by recourse to aristotle he finds a choice paragraph on eloquence in seneca the elder and applies it to his own recollection of bacon s power as an orator and another on facile and ready genius and translates it adapting it to his recollection of his fellow playwright shakespeare to call such passages which jonson never intended for publication plagiarism is to obscure the significance of words to disparage his memory by citing them is a preposterous use of scholarship jonson s prose both in his dramas in the descriptive comments of his masques and in the discoveries is characterised by clarity and vigorous directness nor is it wanting in a fine sense of form or in the subtler graces of diction when jonson died there was a project for a handsome

laid there in each others arms all night even when the sprinklers cried on us we didnt mind we had the rest of our lives to be dry so we stayed until the edges of the sky turned light i would have stayed until our hair turned white the mosquitoes arrived to feast on time got drunk at our expense we didnt mind we let them bite we kept on kissing and obliged say bottoms up youve only got til tuesday so enjoy the ride and i couldnt imagine that i would ever be unhappy again and i whispered in your ear that this moment is already a poem that i just figured out my first tattoo was going to be of bug bites decided id commemorate their bloody drink by printing three circles on my ankle perfect and pink in permanent ink the beautiful wounds that will keep me you and this moment forever linked to remind me when i fail myself when i fail everyone around me when i misfire and come tearing through your walls when the cocktail of humiliation and pain poisons my veins and this carnival of carnage this mansion of garbage this parking lot of carcasses this heartbreak party drains the spirit that remains that i have been a part of something worthwhile to remind me of the pleasure of your pulse the measure of your breath the rise and fall of our fortunes and our chests these spectacular triumphs and flops that even if that moment meant nothing to the universe its the closest thing to

balance adhere to my talent some here you must vanish time for ones loved one to drink from thy chalice it never seizes to amaze me witness them screaming and carry on when i come for their babies or mothers fathers brothers daughters husbands wives uncles slaughter i just do what im supposed to but yet you feel the need to bleed when you see my shadows amongst you you pray for forgiveness perhaps a second chance i do not speak your language why must you even ask your body fills with paralysis your eyes open wide and pupils dilate with self analysis so just relax and let it go let the wings of fate delegate responsibility of your souls and its over now your soul has reached it s destination and its funny how youre at the gates of hell but yet your bodys underground and deafening silence

im the butterflies in your stomach the pill you can t swallow won t go down so well it got jagged edges cuz it lacks attention between timelines and that dimension gives me apprehension just by asking questions i laugh at tension right pass your henchman with ax and wrenches just to use my past for reference someone check my medical records my heart rate plummets when i pen my endeavors the less that i check it the more i act reckless doctors tell me to settle vendettas i will when i feel better but as they pile up they motivate me to be sick forever some people confuse what im doing i learn from my mistakes so im barely a student and barely got friends im daring to do this alienated from people so much im barely a human i sit alone dark rooms thinking its my art school wrting epic like im homer when the stars loom train of thought cartman when hes part coon archer as my lawyer the only way the bar moves heart swoon bumping to those car tunes not talking tv or radio play im probaly get neither i stay on the waves broadcasted from the haters sitting on my grave skeletons in the closet among the bed that i had made but hook people quick to judge the way im living not the norm let

profane offence of asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have established that sage individual s prophetic character once and for ever by tying one end of his pocket handkerchief to a hook in the wall and attaching himself to the other to the performance of this feat however there was one obstacle namely that pocket handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals there was a still greater obstacle in oliver s youth and childishness he only cried bitterly all day and when the long dismal night came on spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious consolation as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a stone yard in the presence of mr bumble who prevented his catching cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated applications of the cane as for society he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer time and there permitted to listen to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself it chanced one morning while oliver s affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state that mr gamfield chimney sweep went his way down the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become rather pressing mr gamfield s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his eyes encountered the bill on the gate woo said mr gamfield to the donkey the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward mr gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey s then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master and by these means turned him round he then gave him another blow on the head just to stun him till he came back again having completed these arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room having witnessed the little dispute between mr gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that mr gamfield was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted mr gamfield smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was encumbered mr gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing for register stoves so he spelt the bill through again from beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said mr gamfield ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a condescending smile what of him if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a good spectable chimbley sweepin bisness said mr gamfield i wants a prentis and i am ready to take him walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat mr gamfield having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him it s a nasty trade said mr limbkins when gamfield had again stated his wish young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another gentleman that s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make em come down again said gamfield that s all smoke and no blaze vereas smoke ain t o no use at all in making a boy come down for it only sinds him to sleep and that s wot he likes boys is wery obstinit and wery lazy gen l men and there s nothink like a good hot blaze to make em come down vith a run it s humane too gen l men acause even if they ve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr limbkins the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report published were alone audible these only chanced to be heard indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis at length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having resumed their seats and their solemnity mr limbkins said we have considered your proposition and we don t approve of it not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat decidedly not added the other members as mr gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings it was very unlike their general mode of doing business if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the table so you won t let me have him gen l men said mr gamfield pausing near the door no replied mr limbkins at least as it s a nasty business we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered mr gamfield s countenance brightened as with a quick step he returned to the table and said what ll you give gen l men come don t be too hard on a poor man what ll you give i should say three pound ten was plenty said mr limbkins ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat come said gamfield say four pound gen l men say four pound and you ve got rid of him for good and all there three pound ten repeated mr limbkins firmly come i ll split the diff erence gen l men urged gamfield three pound fifteen not a farthing more was the firm reply of mr limbkins you re desperate hard upon me gen l men said gamfield wavering pooh pooh nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat he d be cheap with nothing at all as a premium take him you silly fellow he s just the boy for you he wants the stick now and then it ll do him good and his board needn t come very expensive for he hasn t been overfed since he was born ha ha ha mr gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself the bargain was made mr bumble was at once instructed that oliver twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval that very afternoon in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance when mr bumble brought him with his own hands a basin of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way don t make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful said mr bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity you re a going to be made a prentice of oliver a prentice sir said the child trembling yes oliver said mr bumble the kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own are a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of you although the expense to the parish is three pound ten three pound ten oliver seventy shillinsone hundred and forty sixpences and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can t love as mr bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor child s face and he sobbed bitterly come said mr bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced come oliver wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and don t cry into your gruel that s a very foolish action oliver it certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already on their way to the magistrate mr bumble instructed oliver that all he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like it very much indeed both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in either particular there was no telling what would be done to him when they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself and admonished by mr bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch him there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour at the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head unadorned with the cocked hat and said aloud now oliver my dear come to the gentleman as mr bumble said this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice mind what i told you you young rascal oliver stared innocently in mr bumble s face at this somewhat contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining room the door of which was open it was a large room with a great window behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads one of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with the aid of a pair of tortoise shell spectacles a small piece of parchment which lay before him mr limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side and mr gamfield with a partially washed face on the other while two or three bluff looking men in top boots were lounging about the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after oliver had been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk this is the boy your worship said mr bumble the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon the last mentioned old gentleman woke up oh is this the boy said the old gentleman this is him sir replied mr bumble bow to the magistrate my dear oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance he had been wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards from thenceforth on that account well said the old gentleman i suppose he s fond of chimney sweeping he doats on it your worship replied bumble giving oliver a sly pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didn t and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman if we was to bind him to any other trade to morrow he d run away simultaneous your worship replied bumble and this man that s to be his masteryou siryou ll treat him well and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you said the old gentleman when i says i will i means i will replied mr gamfield doggedly you re a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest open hearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for oliver s premium whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty but the magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldn t reasonably be expected to discern what other people did i hope i am sir said mr gamfield with an ugly leer i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the inkstand it was the critical moment of oliver s fate if the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been straightway hurried off but as it chanced to be immediately under his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of oliver twist who despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too palpable to be mistaken even by a half blind magistrate the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to mr limbkins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect my boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed what is the matter stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of interest now boy tell us what s the matter don t be afraid oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with that dreadful man well said mr bumble raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity well of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see oliver you are one of the most bare facedest hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when mr bumble had given vent to this compound adjective i beg your worship s pardon said mr bumble incredulous of having heard aright did your worship speak to me yes hold your tongue mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment a beadle ordered to hold his tongue a moral revolution the old gentleman in the tortoise shell spectacles looked at his companion he nodded significantly we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke i hope stammered mr limbkins i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter said the second old gentleman sharply take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly he seems to want it that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain mr bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good whereunto mr gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

it down to elements h2o a place to go that you can t escape the flow does not exist i love the truth so i persist intelligent men or just gorillas in the mist clenchin a black fist for the size of

slates subway trains and cardboard bound with masking tape it was the sound of the evening the way the day grew late words tumble from lungs over my tongue and gave a new taste to my fate it doesn t even matter how the chatter would paint us with love on our side they could barely stand against us um what up uh kheaven what s goin down um i got your message and uh yeah basically call me back
