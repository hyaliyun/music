fire under a hot spoon the underground ain t got room for pop tunes hip hop should die soon at 12 o clock noon the glock boomed i hit hip hop with shot wounds disguised my costume now hip hop officially lives underground rappers suffocate but it breathe through the nostrils i deem you as hostile hip hop don t need two apostles to teach you the gospel prophet no one can box in as i get closer to top 10 claiming they dope but none of these suckas been hot since they started now they adults with multiple options results of hip hop in 2015 the culture s forgotten i ain t accustomed this game is lame as fuck since we came from substance who knew what changing it up meant yeah your catchy hit made you famous you prideful hate to remind you labels made a mistake when they signed you first you were hot when they made you somehow you flopped you ain t able to come up with these hits now you re dropped from the label proud cuz they gave you 300 000 upfront promised you 3 mill and now you realize they not gonna pay you you thought you were on top when you got your breakthrough but then you flopped when you dropped your debut disabled who s fault is that you re the cause of that for breaking the laws of rap it s all a factor velociraptor you got your jaws attached to the game like cobras striking these niggas are known for biting don t like that they overhyping niggas who don t enlighten i give respect to the person who s first to confess they sold their soul for commercial success what depresses me is no one impresses me now let s agree success doesn t determine the best emcee respectfully i give it honor it s in most of my hip hop is not genre it s a culture i live it and you can live it too through knowledge and overstanding no tolerance silence em if they garbage we spose to ban em when they forgot to implement the 5 elements the culture died ever since and that s why i represent the lifestyle niggas are careless i m here to bring awareness and there will be no interference and what the fuck these new rappers be acting soft for the rap i know is hardcore in it s purest art form not a dj not a b boy or graffiti artist i m an emcee don t worry bout me i mma eat regardless talent i was given all this so i turned my studio into a business office imma make a living off this instead of wasting my time the term failure was erased from my mind and replaced with dedication and grind yeah education is fine but i got a different plan for me mom if i have a boss i can t be a don and i won t stop until my family is on make that a promise i mma do

impossible to offend or harm me so i told myself this isn t rap where s the criticism at in fact i m bringing lyricism back i do it for the love i do it for wealth cuz i know i will always stay true to myself hip hop is dead and not only cuz nas said it did with all this negative it s hard to let it live back when gangs ran the block i give props to africa what bambaataa did was take the culture and made it positive names you gotta respect first and last was the grandmasters niggas trynna destroy what they built like sandcastles don t represent the culture if you don t know how to cuz i m bout to restore it s historic values for certain it wouldn t hurt you to be aware i m the future and this is my purpose for being here rappers don t provide so i figured it won t survive and when the

going never know when we ll be sober to start give me them thundering darks give me them hungers that ve been coming apart so long it s a wonder that we still want to dance but here we are in the

moves like a toad he s just looking for a princess to love him but all the princesses think he s just disgusting you can beat him up but can t budge him i was in budgens picking up a can with my cousin and i saw him bent double by the dustbins retching up a puddle of guts people wanted to help but they couldn t bear touch him the fat prince rolled over too much look you can kick him down but can t crush him you can take him home but can t trust him his heart is a book his armour is crooked his arms are the hooks in the mouth of a mermaid he s been harvesting shook dry by barbarous lips he sees the picture but he s hardly a part of it he s starting to slip trust for him it s harder than it looks they re holding those riddles up in the middle while others hide in their books every cranny every nook people backing up what they could storming alleys in their valleys happy with what they took from what they re given locks their living holding dogs they re sniffing floorboards lifting up in every flat they re slotting all the difficult decisions he s used to it bruises for proof of it fuses shot he didn t use until his uses until he s blot where gruesomes live truth of it abusive kid simply wanted shoes to fit his hands would understand there s a grand if you move this shit sniffing white powder burning through the light hours getting light losers getting tight couldn t lose his grip soon he did slipped and slept where the kid was kept took the deepest breath of his ex said i m deep in debt steep regret cos he died like his brother when all he wanted to do was provide for his mother so give me your guts man deliver them up there s more to the world than the things you can touch come on give me your guts man deliver them up funny feeling in your lungs but the sympathy s strung so come on give me your guts man deliver them up now i m trying to go the distance but i keep getting stuck man give me your guts come deliver them up you sit sipping the wisdom till you re feeling the calm give me a reason the reason is long gone even the feeling i want one is wrong and every evening when i feel it come on i start to laugh start singing the song singing the song look

my days filling my mind flooding my heart with art i had this dream of becoming an artist a painter a poet who knows i had a nice little talent for drawing and a natural feeling for prose i even began to compose so many talents wasn t i blessed all of them good a few of them better none of them best just enough talent to know that i hadn t the talent so i put my dream and my self esteem to rest that must have been difficult yes but it didn t matter i merely had to find out what i was meant to be i couldn t decide then one day i spied palm beach a speck on the map no more than a gap palm beach jungle and seashore muddy and raw but in a flash i suddenly saw what it would take what i could make palm beach i had this dream of a city of artists versailles by the florida sea a sort of world congregation of artists all encouraged to set themselves free i knew what i wanted to be i d be their host and supporter the patron saint of the things that they d write and compose and paint i shall wander among them with lavish praise as they carve their statues construct their plays design their buildings recite their rhymes making modern art fit for modern times so many talents gathered en masse painters and poets artists and dreamers watered like grass and if the talent i have is for nurturing talent then succeed or fail i will see they sail first class and my father can go stick it

loving all the broken and i was too scared to come out and then you busted through my doorway and it seemed so very violent but peaceful words came out and silenced all my silence and i realized that the knowledge that i thought that i had known was nothing compared to you coming to my home so maybe when im dead you will answer all the questions that all of us explained though we knew we didnt

kick up a fuss whenever something disgusts us but if anything is truly pressing we dont discuss much we dont wanna get too depressed and gotta pick up lunch learn to cheat learn to steal learn to pass the blame learn to read the situation learn to play the game make a profit make dollars make millions it doesnt make sense just to mind your own business but as the sun sets one gets a little too

arose where nothing really stood there before a giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed to greet the seventh lord of the seventh

brother had left half alone and half together he d sit up late at night and have to wonder had he lived or died cause he was thinkin but he didn t know why he d go uder the screaming sky lookin at the water reflecting the city lights and he d howl at the crescent moon but he didn t know why and he was all alone he was all alone blue blue mary blue blue mary and screaming john the last to leave when the war was through stabbing at imaginary enemies tryin to run em all through and when the moon stabbed down white light in streams johnny panic fell asleep and had to wrestle with the dragons in his dreams like a knight from round table he was screaming john and he was all alone and he was lookin for home all alone in the middle of the night he went crazy by the candlelight before his final madness came he had a vision of god on an elevated train grieving for the anguish of his lonely lonely boy and mary s teardrops fell like rain and the fields were ripe to bloom again and the sisters of babylon dressed in red were singing for his soul come on johnny let me sing it to you come on johnny let me take you home blue blue mary blue blue mary and screaming
