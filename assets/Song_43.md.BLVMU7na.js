much to which they reply with awkward coughs and such until i feel compelled to elaborate this is not a hobby do it for my salary mate and been doing so for well over a decade see i get paid for putting pen to page performing sets on stage and when selectas play my record let s just say that at the end of the day that s how i collect my wage at which point they inevitably say damn that s how you re expenses are paid yes that s what i m attempting to say well that s great getting to do what you love every day and yes it may seem like i m living the dream but hey there s much more to it when you go behind the scenes when rhymes and beats is the life i lead which i know might seem all nice and sweet but take the time to peep what s behind the scenes you might agree there s more to it the what the eye can see and what i mean is when the lights and screams subside decrease there s deadlines to meet bookers with high fees late nights without sleep sign up for these i never did when i decided to mc now don t get me wrong i know for a lot of people i m living the dream collecting green from spitting sixteens with no 9 to 5 and no cubicle just rhyming live in the studio i don t take it for granted i understand that it s a blessing that my music allows me to travel the planet but like most things there s another side most won t witness for example show business in my experience there s more business then show so instead of ripping flows i m sitting com posing e mails for half of the day tapping away on my mac in a cafe just tracking my pay and taking care of other tedious administrative details necessary but very derailing of most attempts at writing raps this is behind the scenes of my life and i m inviting you back  struggles struggle to survive i guess you can call this my 9 to 5 gimme a chance man i know how to rock it but it s not that easy putting money in my pocket follow your dream as the saying goes but let my case at displaying insane flows over breaks yo but wait no one ever told me the pay s low unless you re drake bro but i started in the middle now i m lower then my 9 to 5 high school friends are homeowners just raising their families happily while i m in this freezing apartment chasing this rapping dream now i do what i love and i love what i do but if you think this is easy you must be new there s so much more to it then just rhyming words together there s marketing accounting answering fans letters grant applications dealing with the press man i reeling from the stress i can feel it in my chest nonetheless i ll keep pursuing this dream but just know there s more to it when you go behind the scenes","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

promises now i ve tested the waters kid sipped it rippled the pond a bit visits have been abolished and this shit s killing my confidence is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment if you miss chicks when they re around the phrase let s quit isn t an option you best fix whatever s wrong and just move on and get on with it cause you ll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it it s sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch when loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high cause it isn t really my time is it shit i just found

stand by the docks love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of death it s as massive a shock and to intellects it s a fuckin smack in the crotch it s a cancer that rots your soul

simply vice invention its only right to mention the fights you get in nightly visions of these tina and ike revisions so what s love really got to do with it from prude women to stool pigeons in soup kitchens the truth isn t as eloquent so be intelligent getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it s irrelevant and that word ll fit like a glove if you don t get right now live your

ya along with everything else man you know i feel ya i thought it was a phase any time it might pass but you kept on loadin tried to kick dres ass yep we had to gas until them eses pulled out i think about it all the time glad we made it out but the next time i called moms didnt sound right said something about a robbery and 15 to life sometimes i feel guilty and sometimes i dont niggas choose they own lanes and do other things to cope it might sound corny but im sayin one love ill remember the laughs and to the time we crossed paths outro no matter no matter what the world may say the memory remains fresh on my mind like it happened today no matter no matter what the world may say and ima just ride on time aint forever dig the words to the song no matter no matter what the world may say if tomorrow never comes im fine plenty of things to do inside my mind no matter no matter what the world may say and i can see it all so clear when i look back tomorrows never

for the cash according to forbes it s bout 800 billionaires out there makes ya wonder how people still die from hunger and these are just the things i ve seen i ain t even touched on the stuff i ve heard about by word of mouth this thing we call life can cause cats to weep all night but front like everything s all right the fast paced rat race did it to them and they end up ruined cause they never think to call christ the world needs jesus the world needs jesus look at the thugs and the greed look at the drugs and disease the world needs jesus the world needs jesus satan s cronies are getting people to buy into phony religions i ve come to the conclusion that most have lost hope and can t cope they re overcome by confusion look we choke and croak from smoke and pollution the deceived believe in a hoax or illusion provoked by delusions young girls face the pressure of measuring up to the artist or actress they ve seen in the magazines the devil is setting them up there s lies in the media and people just eat it up but then they tune me out as soon as i bring jesus up a killa can off ya cause for the right price his lawyer can change murder to manslaughter you got terrorist terrorizing the populous in 01 them ny twin towers got dropped on us racism is insane yo considering god made a world full of colors like the rainbow we fight each other over trivial idiosyncrasies you d think we see that we all got the same foe elections cause lots of tension not to mention crooked law enforcement and politicians this world is full of rotten systems don t tell me that people ain t hurting the world is offering solutions but they ain t working i know you think i m pessimistic really i m realistic the truth sobered me up and i want the rest to get it cause the rest have missed it despite the evidences that the metaphysics of this world is messed up let s admit it and only christ can fix

innervision of peace in the rhythm of life i breathe i m fighting with a fire inside that burns brighter till the final bell rings i was born in a violent storm in an endless fight between right and wrong i write songs like letters from war stuff a message in a bottle then i send it to shore encouragement for the men and woman who lost steam rebel music for my people who been swimming upstream yo

capturing a picture of this combat mission from a complex prison wage war on my inner that s riddled with imperfection my sword swung high as the storm subsides  i was not made just so i could decay these songs aren t played just so we can get paid i walk in the way and the truth til the light works through me i ain t afraid to say the word beauty i ain t afraid to be odd i know the path is hard but somehow im getting closer to god knowing by his scars i am healed i kneel in the storm till the morning stars revealed hey the war is on outside this ain t a soundclash turn it up high say hey

glial cells play an important supporting role in the nervous system they outnumber neurons three to one there are three types of glial cells in the cns 1 astrocytes 2 oligodendrocytes 3 microglial cellsthe neural circuita nerve impulse or electrical signal is created when stimulus is substantial enough to change the electrical potential of the cell membrane the membrane potential of a cellular structure is determined by the in flow and out flow of sodium and potassium although this electrical charge is extremely localized on the cell membrane it is propagated along the length of the neuron so long as the initial stimulus is greater than the threshold potential the threshold potential is partly determined by the extent to which the membrane is polarized if a membrane becomes too polarized this will inhibit impulse propagation when depolarization occurs however the cell is said to be excited action potential1 resting membrane potential 2 depolarizing stimulus 3 membrane depolarized to threshold 4 rapid na entry 5 na channels close k channels open 6 k moves into extracellular fluid 7 hyperpolarization occurs 8 k channels close 9 cell returns to resting membrane potential propagation potential two factors determine the velocity of impulse propagation 1 myelination 2 axon diameternervous system communicationsynapse neurons communicate with each other across a narrow gap called the synaptic cleft a nerve impulse which begins as an electrical signal in the presynaptic neuron will be translated chemically across the synaptic cleft by a neurotransmitter but will be translated back into an electrical signal once it reaches the postsynaptic neuron neurotransmitters 1 rapid acting a acetylcholine b norepinephrine 2 slow acting postsynaptic response as previously mentioned once the neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron the message becomes electrical once again this can result in either an excitatory postsynaptic potential or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential in the axon hillock the sum total of all incoming epsps and ipsps is tallied and this will determine whether an action potential is triggered they can be summed in two ways temporally or spatially central nervous systemwith a better understanding of how neurons transmit impulses we can now look at the central nervous system occupied by the brain and spinal cord brainthe human brain is incredibly complex but for our purposes we will divide it into 4 major regions 1 cerebrum a primary motor cortex b basal ganglia c primary sensory cortex i frontal lobe general intellect and motor control ii temporal lobe auditory input and interpretation iii parietal lobe general sensory input and interpretation iv occipital lobe visual input and interpretation v insular lobe diverse functions usually linked to emotion and self perception 2 diencephalon a thalamus b hypothalamus 3 cerebellum 4 brain stem a reticular formation spinal cord the spinal cord is continuous with the medulla oblongata of the lower brain stem it is specially designed to allow two way conduction of nerve impulses with sensory fibers carrying signals from sensory receptors to the brain while motor fibers originate in the brain and transmits action potentials to end organs peripheral nervous systemthough we began with the structure and function of nerve cells its important to take a closer look at the pns in all it contains 43 pairs of nerves 31 spinal and 12 cranial there are also special subdivisions of the pns sensory division sensory neurons are vital to maintaining equilibrium in an environment that is in constant flux there are five primary types of receptors all of which are important to sport and athletic mobility 1 mechanoreceptors 2 thermoreceptors 3 nociceptors 4 photoreceptors 5 chemoreceptors motor division once sensory information has been processed by the cns a response is calibrated and corresponding instructions are sent to the relevant organs of the body via motor neurons the motor division is often divided into 1 autonomic division a sympathetic nervous system b parasympathetic nervous system 2 somatic division reflex pathways regardless of where the sensory impulse ends up it may elicit a motor response as soon as a stimulus is received there are places where this response may originate 1 spinal cord 2 lower brain 3 motor cortex as one would expect the lower the origin of the response within the cns the simpler the response will be whats interesting about reflex pathways is that they also assist with sensory motor integration under certain conditions this is where the idea of muscle memory comes from though this shouldnt be confused with motor reflexes exactly there are two very specific reflex activities that pertain to muscle function 1 muscle spindles 2 golgi tendon organ motor response at this point we have yet to discuss exactly what happens once a motor neuron impulse reaches skeletal muscle it may be easiest to break it down into component parts 1 alpha motor neuron 2 neuromuscular junction 3 motor end plate 4 t tubulesglossaryacetylcholine adrenergic afferent nerves axon hillock axon terminal central nervous system cholinergic depolarization efferent nerves end branches excitatory postsynaptic potential golgi tendon organ graded potential hyperpolarization inhibitory postsynaptic potential motor nerves

like it goes on forever and i waited for so long the old man s breath came slow and smelled of whiskey in the dawn on a cold november morning in the gentle mist of rain there s just so many reasons that people wait to meet a train and as i waited for my sister to come down the metal stairs he told me that his son had not been home in fifteen years and i barely seemed to notice the tears behind his face but his wishes were no strangers to the people in this place the old man stood there waiting for a young man dressed in blue then he handed him a neatly folded flag and said for you he said your son he died a hero in the service of this flag the old man took it gently put it in his paper bag then i left him in the rain there but i d still hear his voice i try hard not to listen but there

she took my crown of thorns and she wore it as a wedding ring said i do reciprocated vows and blew a thousand kisses to the dissipated clouds i held her claws as we walked between the headstones of those who tried connecting all the dots between her freckles then she let go and so did i as i studied hieroglyphics on her alabaster pigment all her thoughts would compose a careful symphony that summoned all my scars and the ghost of serendipity they sang a hymn though that could cloak the air in mystery to shatter all my shields to expose a flair of misery on a day like this ima break my wrist when i write a little bit about the strangest kiss that would grace my lips and the frozen tongue that was soaked in blood but it tasted bliss i start to choke break in half cause i can hear the battle sounds of gods that close their stake in hand to fight vampiric habits now you think im sentimental i think youre heavy mental with some innocent intents too intense cause you said be gentle and this is more or less a morbid test of sordid stress a foreign sense of orchid scents before i lay my skull to rest i sit alone and think of darkness while the sun is raised you grip that throne to drink from hearts until their blood is drained but at least youre honest speaking like youre being modest til you see a carcass at your feet and then you feast upon it your eyes resemble mephistopheles in fact ive never seen you smile at all and all your teeth are black the diva de los muertos is just swallowing my skin when she sneaks in with the scarecrows and its haunting me again

apologetic you just conjure monsters headed to my head its probable the claws are sharpened sharp and ready steady when youre treading careful not to fall in love cause when im finally done youll know why its called a crush all your bones corroded and they hide inside decaying flesh still you cut your tongue out cause you dont want to taste it yet so save your breath you kiss me like a guillotine fuck just like a whore and smell like whiskey and some listerine follow me again and sing an hour with the wind and when i travel to the gallows you just scowl me again and grin with foul teeth and skin when you go to bury daisies haunted by carriages rosemarys baby listen grave dancer with disarray pander your lips display cancer and kissed my face after come and go to summon hope with cryptic fake glamour but under oath you cut my throat with sickle blade laughter and its hard to keep your sanity when spiritsll consume you and youre consuming spirits just to peer into the voodoo who knewthat you could smile when you take a life surviving from the vitamins youre finding when you take a bite all my questions all are meshes wallowed sections of my chest the small intestines large

never have to take another step in the same direction i am the deliverer of ashes a cultivator of roses in my fathers name and while i missed the pieces of myself that have been killed by my own hands i celebrate the ones that i have created since i have reinvented myself more times than i care to count and each one is a little less beautiful than the last which leads me to here the now the

marriage and having a son but most times she felt like she d never find love so she drank away the pain in blood stained night clubs and when home with men that acted like thugs addicted to the night life like drugs but regrets of the morning after always caught her waking up with men unfamiliar to her daughter even though they gave her an escape from lonely days she never felt better than when they parted ways oh there s no excuse for loving nothing special she thought when his path crossed her mind he could never be the one just occupy her time and fill the lonely days that d become so basic since her heart was torn from the broken off engagement two years ago and three states away but by the look in her brown eyes you would ve thought it happened yesterday now this new with intention to impress bought her tennis shoes and a brand new summer dress if you could see the smile on her face and how it washed away the work week s bitter taste plus this was the week of her born day the sun ray in a life of all work and no play he said he wanted her to spend it with him but she said she d already committed to her friends he denied her invitation to come along and told her to call when she got home oh there s no excuse for loving she pulled into the parking lot startled when she saw him standing right behind her in the dark demanding she tell him who she slept with today smelling the liquor on his breath she began to walk away he grabbed her by throat yanked off the gold chain and almost smiled satisfied at her pain he though of this her reward for being unfaithful lifted from her feet tears roll down her cheek and terrified she closed her eyes while the storm made it impossible to hear her cries he knew this and struck with a clenched fist and told her he wasn t stupid she s now pinned to the ground with his hand on her mouth to muffle the sounds knee planted in her chest until breathing hurt he said she forced him to take back his tennis skirt much stronger she offered very little resistance to him taking back the clothes that he d given then he cocked back his fist for one last blow and left her in the parking lot knocked out

realize where you sit is really just the start of it as your mind begins to wander from this place for your futons in a room and the room is in a house or an apartment on a block in a neighborhood and whether homely plain or pretty its in a town or in a city just like youd expect a neighborhood would and at this time i should relate the citys in a county and the countys in a state the states in a country and the countrys in a continent no matter how you scan it and id like to make it clear that the continent s in a hemisphere which is part of a bigger sphere we call a planet and you re sitting on your futon and your thoughts turn to cosmology our planets in a system which revolves around a star called the sun which is 93 million miles away and the suns in the outer arm of a spiral shaped galaxy of stars which the ancient greeks named the milky way and the milky way is part of something called the local group which contains our galaxy and roughly 30 more and the local group is part of the virgo supercluster containing galaxies nebulae and quasars and everywhere in the universe you look in every cranny and every nook are superclusters brimming with billions of stars and you re sitting on your futon and your thoughts turn to cosmology now heres the trippy part the part that may just blow your mind for stars are made of elements as you may know the elements found in stars are in birds and trees and cars as well as rocks and air and grandmas cookie dough yes the building blocks of the sun are everywhere and in everyone including you and me and your crazy uncle leon they have names that are quite common like helium hydrogen and carbon and stranger ones like beryllium and neon but to see the magic of these stars you neednt travel oh so far or blast off in your custom made spaceship for the elements found in space can even be found inside this place and in your futon where you sit there eating corn chips and you re sitting on your futon and your thoughts turn to cosmology and you sit there on your futon and you wonder what exactly is a futon","is_english":"True","genres_list":"['Unknown
