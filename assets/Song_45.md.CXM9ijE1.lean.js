hate will we destroy our own genetic code what will become of us years down the road can we undo the deal that we struck out of fear raping the globe sobbing the end is near can we stand to look

is the purpose and what is the prize is there some greater goal towards which to aspire do we exist just to fulfill desire it s possible the reason we exist is to give subtle texture to times endless

live the life that i can see as my dream comes to life just fighting to be me i believe in something greater then self i believe there s more to livin life then tryin to get wealth more to life then simply working hard to only get by more to death then what we think when every one of us dies there s more around then we can see not caught by the eye see i might have started walking but i was born to fly world it might have clipped my wings but that don t mean i won t try my feet they may be on the ground but my heads in the sky gotta dream in my heart and a gleam in my eye dropping beats from my birth till the day that i die and though life is hard i always keep my face to the sky looking up to heaven knowing everything will be fine i ve made up my mind my life is decided i write the words and in me music s simply provided i d like to take the credit but i know that i m guided now every track blows up like if two trains have collided you know i wasn t simply created to live a life under rated to trip and fall in the system to live a life full of hatred to blindly agree pay all your dues man you better be careful cause there s a whole lot to lose the world an evil place and man it s easy to use it that why half the time i stay low and i keep on my music but like everything else i m careful not to abuse it so that i m not caught in the hype give up my love of worse lose it and now i realize for something great i was created music s my life and for a long time i have waited to break free and live the life that i can see as my dreams come to life just fighting to be me it can be tough but i am always moving on and with each step you ll find me moving with my song and i know one day i ll open up my eyes and then my time will come you ll see me start rise it s time to take music back take it back to when the had some meaning not continual demeaning time to set it back on track but every time i try to rise again i find i m up under an attack people crying out because they want something fresh but the music is dead girls just show flesh i want something with meaning so i ll rise and protest i fed up living life with all the things i detest and now everybody s fake almost no one real and i don t even care about a signed record deal livin lies so large man it s almost unreal i tell it like it is it s just the way i feel and now young kids give it up throw their lives away all because they listen to the stupid things we say but then they grow up and they learn and they pray and rehabilitation costs a billion a day i m tired of hearing that i cannot be free i m tired of hearing that i shouldn t even want to be me people still are having problems with the colour of my skin hey but i m ok i take it on the chin man this is life some things are messed up my glass is half full some don t even have a cup every day i thank god as i run through this race and do something with my life before i leave this place now i realize for something great i was created music s my life and for a long time i have waited to break free and live the life that i can see as my dreams come to life just fighting to be me it can be tough but i am always moving on and with each step you ll find me moving with my song and i know one day i ll open up my eyes and then my time will come you ll see me start rise political correctness is the way of the day but i m not afraid so let me say the problem isn t us the problem is you stop blaming other people and look at the things you do too bad i can t sing about happy days birds and butterflies cause every 10 seconds someone else in the world dies sufferings everywhere but most of us just close our eyes and nothing changes anywhere man big surprise i ve been fed up for way too long to avoid this rant it s not that i don t want to cool down i simply can t the end is coming soon but hardly anyone believes cause half of us don t care and the other half s deceived the key to life is love and that comes from up above wake up sleeping world cause push has now come to shove not another generation of lazy complacent whining sitting back relaxing while the state of mans declining","artist_name":"Tim
