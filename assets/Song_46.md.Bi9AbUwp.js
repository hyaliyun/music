against the strike that only strikes for more pay by you in this instance i mean me there is a certain kind of person to whom things come with great facility they say this is the noise that gets made as my life is lived so be it but don t feel the need to record it for a second i thought that this meant that they were not interested in history but that s wrong wrong wrong a bad reading of the situation the right reading is that i just don t understand it at all grief point and may day by extension suffers from the same old shit a potential complete ignorance of ambience real ambience in that can you really construct it every last bit of it and just let the listener feel its effects and is this the right treatment always the same question in this case i would maybe say yes just because it forces form onto the thing thing as a bunch of words two melodies and the words sung in a handful of ways between j and d of course the same old war rages one into a tight and perfect digital palace but super true to the genre the other wanting to draw on actual sounds mix it up humanize it s cool how for my part this sleight of hand the trick of making something confounding and great and potentially horrible drawn up from air all this is no longer of any interest in fact even seeing things in this light depresses me and so i often come home at night depressed by what we have done what we are doing it s good it means i ve changed i have lost interest in music it is horrible i should only make things i understand i should only make things i know how to construct however imperfect it s not even like dictating to someone it s less than that may day itself is pretty cool i have to admit it condemns the world at such an easy pace i intend to tell t it is like a happy shooting rockets a disgusting description of anything to be sure i think the world does not like me grim it likes me melancholic but not miserable english on the mediterranean which is oddly enough some of the worst people there is at some point when it is made i will explain this record word for word swear to god an ape with angel glands when i know if it is good or bad i ll know what is good and what is bad the answer to the making of grief point is picnic baskets filled with blood too rich nothing at stake if had to write for his songs they would be cumbersome pale blocks like his riffs but pale so instead he went out and found a wailer too stupid to commit to a single thing i assume not lighting up at the sight of your mother is a sign of madness in an infant patina no name for a baby your firstborn before they threw you from the bridge bagna wrestles his dogs to the floor such a beautiful scene for some they write plays don t perform them the message from the critical

spouting off a bunch of worn out buzzwords bart don t have a cow lis marge bart s right let s none of us have a cow all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it in the android s dungeon

it wasn t great but what right do you have to complain comic book guy as a loyal viewer i feel they owe me bart what they re giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free what could they possibly owe you i mean if anything you owe them comic book guy worst episode ever kent brockman delivers the news kent brockman it looks like the end of the venerable itchy and scratchy program for years tv critics such as yours truly kent brockman have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show s hilarious facade yesterday our prays were finally answered when poochie the dog made his howlingly unfunny debut far be it from me to gloat at another s downfall but i have a feeling that no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep krusty and the writers are watching the report krusty what the hell happened executive well i d attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic coupled with the overall crumminess of poochie krusty you ve got to stop this thing please i m getting egged on the street do something do something homer enters homer uh hi mr meyers i ve been doing some thinking and i ve got some ideas to improve the show i got it right here one poochie needs to be louder angrier and have access to a time machine two whenever poochie s not onscreen all the other characters should be asking where s poochie three meyers great great just leave them right there on the floor on your way out homer does so but realizes something s wrong he eavesdrops on the meeting from a closet next door meyers listen guys we ve got to do something about poochie krusty there s only one thing we can do homer hears something and is shocked at dinner homer tells his family what he heard homer then they said they were going to kill poochie off bart really oh how terrible lisa yes terrible marge it s not your fault homer it s those lousy writers they make me madder than a um yak in heat homer you re right marge it s not my fault i won t let them treat poochie like dirt anymore just because he s the new guy roy right on mr s homer put a sock in it roy at the recording studio meyers okay so here is where itchy lunges at poochie with a rusty chainsaw cue sound effects rustier bellamy are you prepared to die poochie homer no i am not meyers oh cut cut cut cut you ll stick to the script as its written homer you re supposed to say please cut off my head i don t deserve to live homer never you can t just kill of a classic tv character poochie could be bigger than curly fries but first he has to win back the audience that s why i m going to read these lines i wrote myself with my own two hands meyers forget it homer we can do this show without you if we have to bellamy but not without me meyers oh jeez bellamy let him try the new lines meyers alright alright we ll try them action bellamy hi poochie you look like you ve got something to say do you homer yes i certainly do hello there itchy i know there s a lot of people who don t like me and wish i would go away i think we got off on the wrong foot i know i can come off a little proactive and for that i m sorry but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog that nobody wanted i know we can make them laugh and cry until we grow old together meyers and cut june claps then slowly everyone else begins to clap back at home the new episode is about to air homer now kids i know you loved the old poochie but the new one is going to be better than ten super bowls i don t want to oversell it judge for yourself at an ice sculpture contest itchy

another planet lisa uh i guess homer hey that wasn t supposed to happen those finks double crossed me krusty poochie s dead well kids we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die they re back again the very next week that s why i m presenting this sworn affidavit that poochie will never ever ever return lawyer this document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes bart lisa yeah oh bart tough break dad i guess people just weren t ready for poochie maybe in a few years roy good news everybody i m moving into my own apartment with two sexy ladies marge oh then i guess this is

adventuress and courtesan the pride of alexandria and thais was her name nearby in peace and piety avoiding all society there dwelt a band of holy men who d made their refuge there and in the desert s solitude they spurned all earthly folly to devote their lives to holy works to fasting and to prayer now one monk whom i solely mention of this band of holy men was known as athaneal he was famous near and far at fasting bouts and prayer with him none other could compare with him at plain and fancy praying he could do the course in par one day while sleeping heavily from wresting with the devil he had gone to bed exhausted though the sun was shining still he had a vision freudian and though he was annoyed he an alyzed it in the well known style of doctors jung and brill he dreamed of alexandria of wicked alexandria a crowd of men was cheering in a manner rather rude and athaneal glancing there at thais who was dancing there observed her do the shimmy in what artists call the nude said he this dream fantastical disturbs my thoughts monastical some unsuppressed desire i fear has found my monkish cell i blushed up to the hat o me to view that girl s anatomy i ll go to alexandria and save her soul from hell so pausing not to wonder where he d put his winter underwear he quickly packed his evening clothes a toothbrush and a vest to guard against exposure he threw in some woolen hosiery and bidding all the boys adieu he started on his quest  the monk though warned and fortified was deeply shocked and mortified to find on his arrival wild debauchery in sway while some were in a stupor sent by booze of more than two percent the rest were all behaving in a most immoral way said he to thais pardon me although this job is hard on me i ve got to put you straight to what i came out hear to tell what s all this boozin gettin you cut out this pie eyed retinue let s hit the road together kid and save you soul from hell although this bold admonishment caused thais some astonishment she quickly answered say you said a heaping mouthful bo this burg s a frost i m telling you the brand of hooch they re selling you ain t like the stuff you used to get so let s pack up and go so off from alexandria from wicked alexandria across the desert sands they go beneath the burning sun till thais parched and sweltering finds refuge in the sheltering seclusion of a convent in the habit of a nun and now the monk is terrified to find his fears are verified his holy vows of chastity have cracked beneath the strain like one who has a jag on he cries out in grief and agony i d sell my soul to see her do the shimmy once again alas his pleadings amorous though passionate and clamorous have come too late the courtesan has danced her final dance said he now that s a joke on me

foal ill know you by the shift of the wind in the cobwebs the sawdust swirls in the fins of the bullheads craters that you made when you lay down dreamin strange constellations that you gave new meanin by the teeth marks you made on bones of the ice age the smell of the cinder burning slow in your ribcage listen in the distance and you ll hear my shadow footsteps soft as the tread of an echo

different they re both around the same strength although 1 has got a smith n and with the upper hand 1 takes advantage of the clip n span it by the handle and then banged him in his lip but his hand didn t keep a grip and it span out of his wrist and now its sliding on the floor and they re both scrambling for it and 2 gets to the tool before 1 could get a grip now the tables have been flipped and mr 1 becomes the bitch and 2 don t know what to do cuz mr 1 has got a clique mr 2 ain t got a crew cuz mr 1 had them all wigged so in a way hes looking for revenge but he know if he puts a bullet in his temple there ll be trouble in the end and it ll come round at him ten fold he ll probably be covered in bullet holes before he gets home and if he doesn t 1 will still be hunting for his head so fuck he pulls the trigger twice to be certain that hes dead and now hes tryna sneak discreetly off the scene to lay low at his friends gaff while police collect the leads lets say his friends called a cuz mr 3 s a real geez plus i kinda like his eyes pops in copyrightingness of me i m sorry please pay attention to the scene cuz mr a was down with 1 because he used to sell him weed and he felt like they was friends because he gave him better deals and mr 2 came around to tell a the situation cuz a had been his boy since day and he d never betray him but when your laying up with snakes

lucky mr 2 had overheard the conversation and managed to escape through the back of mr a s as they went to grab his gat to try and blast two in his face backstabbing bastard mr a now he started seeing how dramatically things change and how people turn against you in this savage game were playing now mr 2 can make a move and damage them the same or sit and wait for 1 s boys to catch him with a blade when hes sat up at his place tryna relax and getting laid so he knows the only way is to attack him at the base bring the walls around and down and leave him where he lays so now his on his toes again running down the road again the gun is in his holster with three bullets and its loaded and hes looking for a motor and notices this oldish looking beat up two door rover and sees it pulling over he runs up pulls his gun up points the heat straight at the owner says shut up don t look shock up make a scene and its all over gimme the keys and get the fuck up out your seat i told ya don t make me say it twice take your head clean off your shoulders then he drags him out the drivers seat mr 2 jumps in the car before the guy has time to speak flyin at the highest speed driving like a violent teen turns right and realises someones crying quietly he thought of what it mighta been hoped he wasn t right and leaned over to the side and sees a little girl behind the seat frightened for her life

story so sit and wait gonna take you to a time when i wasn t so great when i used to run the street with miss matched socks and the summer of 1984 was hot the jams in the park were really dope and the girls on the block were playin jump rope but i couldn t hang out with the guys who hung cause my mother always told me i was just too young but she couldn t understand what it meant to me that the parties in the park is where i had to be but way back then i couldn t see back to reality she would always disapprove but i didn t care cause if a jam was in the park i just had to be there she would send me to my room and then lock the door but it really didn t matter cause i lived on the first floor i thought about the girls i couldn t wait to meet so i jumped out the window then i hit the street when the music started pumpin everybody got up the vernon posse had the dancefloor all sowed up that s when i thought partyin was all about despite a few fights and a few shoot outs everybody kept partyin without a care you had to have fun cause it was in the air from blocks away you could hear them shout and it got real hype until the power went out it only lasted for a minute but ist felt so long till the deejay got up and put the power back on everybody kept dancin to the record s groove so i pushed up on a cutie and we started to move it felt too good to be true to me back to reality my eyes were mesmerized by the dj s cuts and i knew later on i would have a sore butt so i sat and thought what the beatin would be like but i would take seven beatings just to get on the mic see unlike other kids i wasn t athletic but as i grew i realized i was poetic when other kids would wanna play with their friends i would rather sit day dreamin about my benz with the and the as i yeah that would be me back to reality my mother used to watch me curiously but no one really ever took me seriously they used to laugh and diss me but it was okay cause i knew deep inside i would make it one day i did a lot of hopin and wishin way back then cause i knew i would make it but i didn t know when cause through my dreams i couldn t see back to

running through these hoes with no proper decorum not a pretty picture unsettled miser y he would say his pop was a dog now ain t that the pot calling the kettle nigga every player dreams of leaving the game straight walking out the allure of new pussy is cool but when it s over what the fuck you got to talk about such an empty feeling you win or you lose wifey told him it s them or me and baby

dont even know nigga matter fact i know i just hate to admit that i made mistakes in my past i wish i had the chance to erase industry be treated like a relay and every night i replay situations where it could have been on nigga dupri still fuckin with my dome nigga whats even worse is that my 11 gs they gave me to compensate for the loss i blew in less than 7 months nigga imagine coming back to what happened with jd after bragging to everyone like niggas bout to pay me 19 thinking like this is the shit i work for i cried myself to sleep for three days straight no homo fuck it back to these rhymes no wasting time on the could have been or should have been just spit my struggles till im maxed out i black out five tapes dropped in less than a year or two a buzz i felt would place me amongst the hottest but nah nigga sit your black ass down you in the same situation with your black ass now one of your projects could have got you the shine that you revered but you dropped it and like an idiot just fucking disappeared i was young and stupid plus no type of assist or direction a proper representation no plan to keep me a method shit it im hard headed would think that i would learn but did it again twice like it was nothing of my concern struggle rapper what are you after ever since seven i looked to heaven dont let it happen my barber gave me free cuts told me if you aint rapping forget it im fucking taxing no asking thats why my passion has never been lacking im looking for some answers when niggas that you started with seem to master the art of it and climb beyond the stances reminiscing when kendrick was prepping on dropping od when cole released the warm up but on my mama i had cold feet fast forward a couple years later you see the time pass like what progression have i made excuses made at some point my jealousy raging when i should be looking inside but i dont want to face it save it plus im dealing with life shit like how the fuck im finna pay

in my mamas house barely graduated fuck is college when the dramas out fired from my recent job and filed for unemployment pay a bill to silence scrutiny and bring about enjoyment this musics only real if you can somehow pay the bills and i aint eating worth a shit but in time i know i will you can t tell that to the woman who brought your life in this world supporting you while you chasing dream and sex with your girl in your little brothers room while hes sleeping out on the couch i feel embarrassed to even let it come from out of my mouth damn and thats just only half of the story ill take you back to 07 shit is true when i was kicked out spent my last 20 on a cool in the course of five years i returned to where i left from acquired the desire and lost it faster than red rum dont even fret or guess when i hear these rapper you diss like they got it and im the one that was slept upon and just missed i dismiss that peace to the niggas getting their kit kat no love and showing hate thats how a bitch act i swear ill never get that but wont even lie i wish that it was me half of these niggas take for granted what they see thats why when niggas get multiple chances to do it right and fail to follow up it makes me sick to my knees struggle rapper what are you after this could be beautiful or turn into a great disaster truly my calling i just hope i didnt miss it if i did

holy ghost like jesus is my savior turn around and doubt the path you lay for me to walk your favor a human with a dream of rhyming music is changing so much i barely notice the climate maybe my image needs improvement maybe im doing too much on my own and need to drop some of this weight on my team for me to get known im my own label my own publicist my own composer my own engineer a lone soldier i got to keep me motivated everybody i know has made it struggling the most in a circle full of personal favors you know i spit it from the heart nigga its been like this from the start nigga the only thing that i was taught nigga honesty the policy and choice so know your part nigga for real you joke about it but i wake up having nightmares lack of recognition 30 plus reciting white tears im torn

gave me this because i m humble and he can do the same for you too but if you re seeking his love and affection what you re doing is the last thing i d do he sends killers to hell fire both here and

you working humbly someday he may give you what he s given me well the crowd just didn t know what to do with that nor could they prove what he said wasn t true and since he had what everyone else
