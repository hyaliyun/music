off the wishlist and stand tall and proud while the welcome mat is slipping this is the land of how s your day none of your business where that faint glimmer of hope only comes when you blink and miss it instant sob story tell em today was a tearjerker and a million hands are reaching out saying they know it hurts but cry me a river and i ll piss you a puddle cause either i don t give a fuck or my compassion s too subtle i m past the fool s trouble of weeping cause you struggle where i walk everyone got a shiny pin to burst bubbles and the others are muzzled with silver spoons never gotta see the sidewalks crack to form tombs street light filaments pop trying to cover up the wounds from that lucky shot in the dark that shook a whole platoon i stomp through clutching a grudge in my hand throw caution to the wind where my friend used to stand and the corner characters are all the same used to be handing em trust with every single pound i gave now i m slapping em disgust and ain t returning their gaze so stop trying to find a friend hiding underneath the daze new page old book scarred face don t look there s a place reserved for everyone where the bodies are put the meaning of life is just too long to stand through where doorbells play the music that the dead dance to homesickness this is the place that i used to call home homesick it s just another backyard warzone home and you could stand right in the middle alone cause everybody knows there s just no place like home home is where the heart is that s a coffee cup and a subway token for the heartless coughing up his life and choking down your garbage with a prime seat to watch gold paved streets tarnish while the paint leaks on em and drips down through the cracks where the trains reap harvests of dreams fell to the tracks some seek that light at the end of the tunnel til they fall flat but weather never follows little orphan annie s forecast there s veterans with bottles on the corner selling war masks sun ain t coming out tomorrow so we follow storms half steppin ten bucks for them neatly packaged weapons and then creep into a staircase with a cheap bootleg of heaven where every scar is proof you ll never learn your lesson who s next is the burning question use your head at your discretion cause there are no good intentions and no one cares what you think floating along on a cloud while everyone s hoping you sink froze in a blink sucking a picket fence dream wake up on receiving ends of disappearing machines you ll tear at the seams the garden of eden reduced to short stumps where life s rough so cats carry clips full of shortcuts and they re eager to show you the end bit the hand that feeds so many times there s nothing left to extend just hope those blinking lights don t mark the final breaths of a friend keep walking til you find a warm hole in the wall to rest your head stuck in a box cold sweating stare out the window where the demons run free and let it all set in aftermath of pandora hellraiser wedding and you re forced to sleep on the dirty honeymoon bedding homesickness today s lesson is duck and run homesick and leave the light on for something that never comes home look happy or you ll ruin all the fun throw your hands in the air if you know that you re scum every other second s a deep breath before the bad news and the wreckage of each step s too much to get through speak for yourself or somebody less important or you ll find out hubris makes a great lining for coffins cemetery street where the madmen walk clumsy with crooked smirks bearing their teeth worn ugly just trying to make that smiley face stick where the lips split and ending up with em stitched closed homesickness homesickness homesickness

that they are special and apart the lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers and when they pair off two by two they feel they are the chosen few and though their beds are made of straw they feel like velvet in the night and so the night is never ending it s made of distance and pretending that they re special and apart the lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers and when love goes away and when love goes goodbye and it catches in their throats like cotton and it rises in their hearts like rain the good times suddenly are all forgotten the hunt begins again they search the subways and the streets their faces tired like their feet their bodies aching to be warm and so they hide behind the moon their loneliness inside them growing but they take comfort in just knowing that they are special and apart the lovers the lovers of the heart the lovers and when love comes again and when love comes hello it rises from their throats like singing and it comes up from their hearts like wind the good things strangers in their arms are bringing makes life all right again they turn their faces to the light no longer hiding in the night so unashamed and unafraid that they can face each other

and a tiny trace of fiddling in the distance far behind him and a dime across the counter then a shy hello a brand new friend a walk along the street in the wintry weather a yellow light an open door and a welcome friend there s room for more and then they re standing there inside together he said i ve heard that tune before somewhere but i can t remember when was it on some other friendly shore did i hear it in the wind was it written on the sky above i think i heard it from someone i love but i never heard it sound so sweet since then and now his feet begin to tap and a little boy says i ll take your cap and he spun off in the magic of her smile and leaped the heart within him went when off across the floor he sent his clumsy body graceful as a child he said there s magic in the fiddlers and there s magic in this town there s magic in the dancers feet and the way they put them down people smiling everywhere boots and fiddles locks of hair and laughter oh blue suits and easter gowns the sailor s gone the room is bare the old piano s sitting there someone s hat s left hanging on the rack the empty chairs the wooden floor that feels the touch of shoes no more a waiting for the dancers to come back and the fiddle s in the closet of some daughter of the town the strings are broke the bow is gone and the covers buttoned down but sometimes on december nights when the air is cold and the wind is right there s a melody that passes through the

best choice for an epic hero between the two heroes are known to be as the one who saves the day as we know from the story of star wars luke was born into a normal life living as an average agriculturist boy growing bored luke realized that it would be time for him to go out into the world and explore though he was familiar with the clone wars he desperately wanted to know more concerning that his own dad was part of the combat obi wan ken obi had come to look for luke and tell him that his dad was part of the clone wars but that he did not know who he was luke was on a mission to go and try to help princess lea where she was luke was able to help lea and her struggle my mom was born into a very poor life the education in the country was very bad her parents and parents were never able to send her off to school in the city at the age of 12 my mother decided to go and move to the city to work so that she could help support her family while she was in the city she was able to raise enough money to support her family and go to school when she was 17 she was able to get papers and come to america she started low but then quickly was able to have her very own cleaning business she raised enough money to bring her parents to the united states she is an epic hero because even though she started from ground zero she was able to quickly get up and move and to be the one to make sure that her family had a better life here in the united states my mother would be the best person for an epic hero since it shows the life of a person who has struggled but has been able to rise and keep fighting for the reward starting from a status quo and finishing in the resolution life was very hard for my mother she risked herself to go into the city and work knowing that she would be leaving her family she fought to get the best out of life and things still didn t go as planned luke qualifies as an epic hero but my mother shows realistic issues that many of us could relate to when my mother was 18 she decided that she would migrate towards the united states the situation in el salvador was getting worse every day luke had a very hard journey as well but the situations in his story aren t as real as those of my moms journey in conclusion heroes are in every corner of the earth and you can find them if only you seek to them this is why luke expresses the role of an epic hero my mother shows similar aspects and my mother is the best option like the hero william shakespeare says we know what we are but know not what we may
