other names but behind all of these names is a boy who lived in what is now western turkey about 1700 years ago his name was nicholas now when nicholas was a little boy a plague struck his home town and both his parents got sick and they died he went to live with his uncle who was a monk in a monastery who taught him all about god and jesus now when nicholas parents died they left him all of their money but monks are supposed to be poor so nicholas resolved to give it all away especially to other children in trouble there s a wonderful story about three girls who cold not get married because they had no dowries now in those days a girl had to have a big sum of money or a dowry if she was to marry if she didn t she d be sold as a slave nicholas heard of this and he came up with a plan late at night he tossed a stocking full of gold coins through the bedroom window of the oldest daughter soon she married a good husband she said she had the dowry hidden away in her sock nicholas again tossed a sock full of money through the window of the second daughter she too soon married but when nicholas crept up to the house with the third sock full of money for the third daughter he found all of the windows were shut so he did what boys sometimes do he climbed up on the roof and he dropped it down the chimney and it landed in the girl s shoes which were beside the hearth when she too married claiming that her dowry was in her shoes people were amazed and they said to one another it s some kind of miracle st nicholas was an orphan boy who became a priest and then a bishop who loved jesus and god and gave away all of his wealth to the poor and especially to children in

everybody wants them dead presidents see those that don t have it love jackin you head to toe and people that s clockin a grip always eager to make more cause money can help your heart and money can help you out but if you re makin too much of it then money can help you die and ain t that scary like jason you can t win for losin cause of the grip that you re makin now this particular paper is

she let him be daddy for awhile cause the dicks good plus he s fine and all swole lookin bounty but that don t mean shit when you re broke and you re hungry that s why daughter s daddy s new name is mr county check this out they say it s the root of all evil and i could truly say in this case a friend of mine was makin that big time lunch meat but then he made a small time lunch meat mistake cause soon homie lost all his love for the small life forgot all of which he had came from before and started gettin greedy so another man sent a little bullet and the bullet read my homie had to go cause he thought money is everything money is everything money money money money money money money money is everything  now do you remember when your elders used to scream and tell you money ain t

ago today a philosopher named plato wrote an allegory of what it meant to be a human being and how we view this world its a beautiful work and i have the immense honor of giving it to you in musical form can we imagine that we are bound at the neck and legs in a matter that we cant seem to move our heads sitting shackled and ensnared on a cave floor and behind us lies some form of light source but were stuck staring blankly at the cave wall angled perfectly to see where that light falls and thats the biggest past these shadows are cast and our minds have to try and decipher what our eyes saw this is our only known reality the worlds small with the prisoners mentality we struggle to make sense of the specters so naive we let our ignorance protect us but everything weve seen is a lie at least this skewed version of the truth and if we just opened up our eyes then maybe we can search for the truth ive seen something new the greens and the blues ive opened my eyes and ive seen the truth and ive learned of life and ive learned to feel and closing your eyes doesnt make it less real now lets imagine that were set free but all the other prisoners are let be and when we finally turn our heads and we see the light its overwhelming and we cant see to use our eyes but over time our sight adjusts and refocused see this cave as we never would have noticed and the world that weve known since our early youth are simply just shadows of a bigger truth now suppose that we are carried all the way out far from the prison and the darkness of the caves mouth we take it in and we wonder what it all means dont have the words for the world thats gone unseen come to know that this place is the only truth and that everything before was a foolish lie and that the sun is the only proof of the prisoners we left behind ive seen something new the greens and the blues ive opened my eyes and ive seen the truth and ive learned of life and ive learned to feel and closing your eyes doesnt make it less real  once a man obtains true enlightenment he will be viewed as an outsider by those he once considered peers for they cannot comprehend the world he explains but it is the duty and the responsibility of every enlightened man to bring those people in the dark out to the world he has

gonna do bunch of mights and maybes complaints and fake schemes out of your mouth on the daily but you follow through want everything else it s just as weak as your daydreams and i m stuck here in this nightmare well aware that you don t care if i took my last breath of air and just like that i disappear so insecure my line between fantasy and reality to me is nothing more than blurred my confidence is gone and all i got going for me is that i m breathing and these words to this fucking song could it be possible that someone feels like i someone to tell me that it s over there s really

and the trees i cried when i found kissing boys wasn t for me so i tried every trick in the book i tried talking to the pretty boys and changed the way i looked but wearing dresses to impress just left me lonely and upset and the boys could tell when i looked at her i wasn t interested in them it s not worth hiding if you got something to say and it s not worth smiling if you re feeling in pain and it s not worth hiding if you think you might be gay or different in another way you re perfect just the same i opened the paper and it left me in shame it said these contagious gays aren t safe and you should keep your kids away but i grew older and bolder and my friends caught on slowly nineteen and we re through all the way to my shoulders we sang it s not worth hiding if you got something to say and it s not worth smiling if you re feeling in pain and it s not worth hiding if you think you might be gay or different in another way you re perfect just the same so tell me anyone if you love them as a daughter could you love them as a son we all smile at different faces we all blush at different names but holding someone s hand should never make you feel ashamed  your story might not be at all like mine i don t mean to simplify that should be in your own voice in your own time but the cages that they ve made us should soon just rust away and this song just won t need singing but for now i ll let it play it s not worth hiding if you got something to say and it s not worth dying for the people who don t smile at your name it s not worth lying if you re feeling in pain and it s not worth hiding if it s happiness that could be on your way1","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

hieroglyphics she stands beneath the moon and sea she says she kills the one who loves her and then she points her gun at me i gave her vision in all her bullets i gave her words which calmed despair i gave her love against her shoulder i buried diamonds in her hair i said i love you to her shadow even as her figure walked i blamed my sadness on her words remembering the way she talked the shape of masters long forgotten she formed without the need to say so i knew and then in silence understood that i would pay her fragile grace inside deep yearning her eloquence with what she wore the way she woke up like a virgin the way she lay down like a whore battle scars and sweet oblivion she whispered all these things to me and when she left me in the shadows i could no more seem to see in the
