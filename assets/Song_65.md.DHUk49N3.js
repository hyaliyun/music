drums are played by gorgeous topless men it s proven very efficient throughout the years but please feel free to try other alternatives it s proven very helpful to go the exact opposite way use a grandmother step 3 show the viewers your country s ethnic background by using an old traditional folklore instrument that no one s heard of before no no in this case it s proven much more efficient to not use a young model go with an old man instead a beard helps this instrument is called a swedish kvinnabske a small roundish piece from the horn family inherited from the vikings just make something

give and you never catch a freebee what is it that makes one man give and makes another man put a lock on his and say i m not gon give maybe it s the difference in the way that he thinks god forgives what he thinks he sees he does such if he sees he s been forgiven much he loves much but if he thinks his sins are mad small then he s never seen love so he can t give it at all to him it s just as if

and forests in the mansion of a father only wilt become a virgin only when thou hast a suitor only when thou wedst a hero one foot on the father s threshold and the other for the snow sledge that will speed thee and thy husband to his native vales and highlands i have wished thus many summers sang it often in my childhood hoped for this as for the flowers welcome as the birds of spring time thus fulfilled are all my wishes very near is my departure one foot on my father s threshold and the other for the journey with my husband to his people cannot understand the reason that has changed my former feelings cannot leave thee now with gladness cannot go with great rejoicing from my dear old home and kindred where as maiden i have lingered from the courts where i was nurtured from my father s band and guidance from my faithful mother s counsel now i go a maid of sorrow heavy hearted to the bridegroom like the bride of night in winter like the ice upon the rivers such is not the mind of

happiness is not my portion like the flat shore of the ocean like the dark rift of the storm cloud like the cheerless nights of winter dreary is the day in autumn dreary too the autumn evening still more dreary is my future an industrious old maiden ever guarding home and kindred spake these words of doubtful comfort dost thou beauteous bride remember canst thou not recall my counsels these the words that i have taught thee look not joyfully for suitors never heed the tongues of wooers look not in the eyes of charmers at their feet let fall thy vision he that hath a mouth for sweetness he that hath an eye for beauty offers little that will comfort lempo sits upon his forehead in his mouth dwells dire tuoni thus fair bride did i advise thee thus advised my sister s daughter should there

be submissive to the orders of a husband fairest bride thou didst not heed me gav st no thought to my advices didst not listen to my counsel wittingly thy feet have wandered into boiling tar and water hastened to thy suitor s snow sledge to the bear dens of thy husband on his sledge to be ill treated carried to his native country to the bondage of his people there a subject to his mother thou hast left thy mother s dwelling to the schooling of the master hard indeed the master s teachings little else than constant torture ready for thee are his bridles ready for thy bands the shackles were not forged for any other soon indeed thou lt feel the hardness feel the weight of thy misfortune feel thy second father s censure and his wife s inhuman treatment hear the cold words or thy brother quail

foam did thy brother call thee and thy sister called thee flower when thou leavest home and kindred goest to a second mother often she will give thee censure never treat thee as her daughter rarely will she give thee counsel never will she sound thy praises brush wood will the father call thee sledge of rags thy husband s mother flight of stairs thy stranger brother scare crow will the sister call thee sister of thy blacksmith husband then wilt think of my good counsels then wilt wish in tears and murmurs that as steam thou hadst ascended that as smoke thy soul had risen that as sparks thy

deserts thou o maiden hast been thinking thou wouldst happy be in wedlock neither work nor care nor sorrow from this night would be thy portion with thy husband for protection not to sleep art thou conducted not to happiness nor joyance wakefulness thy night companion and thy day attendant trouble often thou wilt drink of sorrow often long for vanished pleasures when at home thou hadst no head

wounded by the way side in his hand but empty honors weep o weep my sister s daughter weep great rivers from thine eyelids if thou dost not weep sufficient thou wilt weep on thy returning to the scenes of happy childhood when thou visitest thy sister lying prostrate in the meadow in her hand a birch wood mallet when the ancient maid had ended then the young bride sighed in anguish straightway

again her excuses start to fill my empty stomach to the brim the room starts to spin and i cry till i dry heave i am a dying piece of her past just another band aid she needs to relax until she justifies my pain with a reason that lacks see i just wanted her to see herself like i do beautiful but she speaks her lies in haiku so resurrect me teach me where to go from here and i will script to melody with meanings that are so sincere her frozen tears are streaming down the sculpted ice giving me the coldest bite every time i hold it tight im masochistic when i love you till my heart bleeds ill love you till i break when im running from your sharp teeth im out of breath as i hang onto the broken glass picking up the pieces being strangled by a photograph and shes a black rose trapped in cracked roads that cant grow but still im lost in her splendor and im an idiot minus the savant when im trying to move on but choose not to remember guy wait a second where are you girl im here guy i didnt say you could come here girl can i come there i spent the midnight admiring your crooked edges juggling with history and times that we mistook as head trips and look for exits from green eyes that haunt me at these times of wanting to idolize your good intentions its not a friendship its a see saw torment im down on all fours for it and shes all for it i used to find a little piece of solace in your breathing pattern fair in war and love but you cautious when you reached the latter werent you love do you believe in angels or just an instability and using me to scapegoat i held your flaws and the beauty that you mangled and i told you that i loved them just so that you could see your halo and when she lies im a casualty of that and when she said she loved him i felt my galaxy collapse im dancing to the heartbreak while echoes make a point of it ive never felt like this i think about you in these nightmares and daydreams holding onto memories in times where wed make peace but youre a pantomime witch hunt for truth you have so many faces tell me which one is you and you can be with him or anybody else but they will never love you the way that this somebody felt but now

your lungs and then blow a cloud as you said goodnight when you swept down the last of it is it tidy in your room do you feel the phantom limbo as you bend beneath the broom there s a thousand words i ve framed behind my eyes when i close my lids there s a childhood glimpse as i leave the day behind  and at night when my bones surrender to the wind blown from the sea and i m sure that you re the
