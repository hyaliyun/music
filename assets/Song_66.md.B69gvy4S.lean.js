you lost touch every time you made a change you actin like it s for us more artists more content more donations damn when did money become motivation i still remember everything you said that day and how you treated me when i chose to walk away life gets hard trust me i can see that now but i m still here hoping that this finds you well i m hoping that this finds you well i m really hoping that this finds you well naw it was nothing like love but that doesn t mean that it wasn t enough to have me twisted up thinking that s what happy was maybe too presumptuous thinking that you cared for us and then the moment that i went and turned my back i catch you on your back with the homie in his flat fuck he was my brother thought you were my girl in just a matter of minutes you can lose your whole world just a kid heartbroken without a single friend screaming that i d never love again saw you two years later i finally did forget and then you acted like we d never even met damn that had me messed up for too long been 10 years and it s still here in this song writing a story that i never thought i d tell hell i hope this finds you well i really do girl in order for us to explore these beautiful blank pages we must first turn the pages that we ve already written and i know it s hard to let go of the pain and troubles of the past but i m here for you we can do it together  i am nothing without honesty in truth i hated you for how she s blamed wrongfully never mind the fact you never cared but to act like it s her choice that you was never there then to speak dirty on the only one who loved us and to take advantage of her and beat up my little brother when you d go i d pray to god that you were gone for good lost faith cause despite my prayers knew you never would i used to dream about killing you just a boy wishing such an ill will on you can you imagine how you have to treat your son to have him wishing on a star for a bullet and a gun pain begets pain but

if you did and dont believe in me now thank you without you guys none of this would be possible but i still have a few things that i have to get off of my chest barry allen as i run from my demons hugging my soul tight became accustomed to fear failure frivolous relationships and lives being taken when there was no right at this point im just numb to it but i wont succumb to it how many bullets can i dodge alone do i put my faith in this world or only in your god alone never mind bullets how many snakes slither round my home praying for my downfall and my people to die as clones or maybe its just my paranoia speaking for me i look around dont see any black doctors or scholars but i know who was murdered last night i went to school with him as a matter of fact i was pretty cool with him we balled together he was young hit by a stray and that could happen to anyone of us on any day but should it see aint no unity between you and me no ones immune to these in our community sincerely yours me and my friends are from three different worlds and you know that ish love peace and little bit of hope thats it but i wont lie those homicide numbers float in my mind pretty similar to the soul that sits with the skeletons in your closet that you wont give in to sincerely yours i look myself at 19 and see a different person a person whos hoping hes alive next year a person thats human hurting that usually hides that sheer terror caused by hallucinations that arrived last year never been too in depth with my feelings unless with my friends reclusive with everyone else but extroverted to them never been too in depth with my feelings unless with my fans rina said we could live forever never knew what that meant imagine knowing so much about me yet still knowing nothing whatever the weather for better or worse i give my all cause its something for every person walking up to me in silence in public you pull your sleeves up showing what youve survived through its touching that im the reason then you ask about my old friends cause im an open book and how two friendships that close can both end i tell you that its just life to some its bout control if they dont have control they lose sight just so you know  sincerely yours sincerely yours i see the times we live in i see the writing on the wall and the blood thats spilling i see unnecessary wars and the guns thats killing my people in hands of my people and the drugs still filling our neighborhoods up with this evil aint no fathers supposedly caught doing something illegal if they aint for my people i am sincerely yours my name is byron henderson recently turned 21 i lost my best friend at 18 so if im to give you one piece of advice its cherish whoever you have with you relinquish your vices ive had a lot of things happen to me like having to leave a friend to die cause he was bleeding out after being shot by a cop for no reason tell me how to get over that or the thief that left tony leaking i aint known for holding back or to pull it and start squeezing see i lost a couple friends cause we grew apart listen ive gained a couple fans if i influence yall then id better make it positive how am i to shed light on this how am i to prevent suicide at the time im writing this if im to lose anyone else i promise i might flip couldnt care less about having this game in a vice grip couldnt save me

the man with finesse keep the ladies blushin walked to my show from a limousine pull out my roll and count my green when i count i make no mistake so i better start to break like a bird in the sky fly real high i m so bad you wonder why my name is k k rockwell i m a gemini to all the young ladies you know he s fly and that s no lie hey rodney c you ve been chillin hard standin on my side playin bogart but now it s time for you to say a funky rhyme and don t you forget and don t you forget and don t you forget your zodiac sign well i m little rodney c and i m on the go and my zodiac sign is l e o i m a king without a castle or a crown but i got something that can t be found in the yellow pages or a cracker jack box rockin in phases until i reach the top and when i reach the top my name will be grand i ll be the best mc throughout the land but when i reach the top i won t take all the credit i m down with double trouble and i ll never forget it when i write my rhyme and tryin to think i tap my paper my eyes will blink i pick up my paper write down my rhyme gotta make sure that the rhyme is on time so over and over i read my rhyme i make it sound better every time on the mic and the party s packed i gotta make sure i don t sound wack too many people listen to me you know i sound good good as could be cause i m one of a kind your mind i just can t repeat or left behind but those other mcs that think they re ahead they really ain t nothin and soon they ll be dead i shoot em down into the ground leave their face in the mud where it can t be found move right up collect the just how and how rockwell does is get ready y all rock steady y all because i bump more stuff than crazy eddie y all party people in the place time to listen to me when you hear me rap i talk the truth you see because i don t bite don t dare to duplicate when other mcs hear me rappin wishin they could imitate because they don t have a style of they own they listen very hard when i m on the microphone they go up to my front stare in my face while i m rappin on the mic at a steady pace but it s alright if they re on my tip cause i know damn well they can t rock this so when the party s over and it s time to go home they try to think of what i said on my microphone when they re sittin down tryin to make up they own they find it very hard to leave mine alone cause my style is def my words are threats i haven t met an mc that rocked me yet so they take a chill they give me respect because they know if they don t i ll put em in check and that s a threat y all that s a threat y all and we could even make a 50 bet y all that we were winning the race from the very start there is nothin in the world that can tear us apart we had determination to reach the top we had love for the people who watched us rock our purpose were all the same we said fame and fortune is what we claim but hard times y all were knockin at the door what we had from the start was there no more they tried to slow us down to a halt they told us to our face it was our fault they accused misused and they tried to abuse the battles we fought we were bound to lose so to be young men we had to take the loss cause you got to pay the cost to be the boss but now we re back and we re on the double don t mess with us unless you re lookin for trouble double trouble double double double double double dub

tired she couldn t make out a word she said she was tryin to see if eventually i would scream the name of a bird i told her that s absurd and then gave her the face like word and then she replied yeah said it was quite weird said she was type scared i said that s a side effect that you get when you trade bad dreams for some great nightmares when i close my eyes i escaped the poltergeist my escape from reality just what i needed brings me to a place where shorty never cheated and even if she tried and succeeded in this other world i wouldn t even get heated fuck the details i don t care about why i m chillin with my grandmother she ain t die i was browsing online and seen mike on a banner that said you can be like me and beat cancer anything i touched i d feel know its fiction but it seemed so real was leavin out the casino with a nympho yes rae it can be so simple here s how i avoid a problem with my kinfolk learnt how to build me a house with no windows and that s when i think i saw a ribbon in the sky but it wasn t from an in tro cause where i m at is no rumors or gossip but still got love for ms in fo she said in my sleep i d be laughin but shit be funny to me look my ice cream was two hundred degrees if it dripped i d get a hole in my dungarees see my anonymity is my protection and me and hip hop have no connection which got me to reflectin is that why the mirror won t show my reflection when i close my eyes there s no dollars so we can scratch that one as an excuse or why folks do the things they do or why people act so brand new i had wings on flyin out a prison with a ratchet was only there cause someone snitched look no one s poor but no one s rich just my way of creepin if life s a bitch took a walk on the ceiling just to get my mind right that was yesterday so in hindsight since i was able to haul off i took it as god tellin me i ll never fall off got rid of name brands in the jewelry most people just use it as medicine like it take em somewhere they ain t never been but here you better off not better than stuck in the room with a elephant opened the closet and dapped up my skeleton had a convo with a man with no ears and all of a sudden everything became so clear have no fear i just bought a first class trip to nowhere everybody goes there but they don t stay the whole year me i got three hundred and sixty five shows there my girl said in my sleep i d be walkin so i ask baby where i go uh she said i be walkin slow but she don t ever want to get out of bed so she don t know i went to see a man walkin on water asked if he d ever get things back in order i ve been there two years over a quarter but everytime i open my eyes it s like torture he said please i gave you a whole nother world for you to go do with as you please just so you appeased mixed with a couple of signs about real life while you make believe so i teleported out of there with a grin met a bum with a mansion invited me in then we politiced about politics said somethin about def jam i ain t acknowledge it i went to see a virgin with aids yeah i thought about smashin that yeah her ass was fat so appealin tattoo on her inner thigh said she doin better than she was feelin i think i seen shorty before maybe in a club or somethin or maybe in vip but wasn t nobody there but me and the club was all red then she started playin with my head and then i came then i asked shorty what s her name and it was weird cause she fucked around disappeared like what a cruel joke cig lit but from it was no smoke flicked in the ash tray and seen stack s face flash through a school hallway on a half day was gettin chased couldn t tell by who then a hallway turned into a cliff screamin piff before i was dead somehow i jump my ass up out that bad then

as my life is lived so be it but don t feel the need to record it for a second i thought that this meant that they were not interested in history but that s wrong wrong wrong a bad reading of the situation the right reading is that i just don t understand it at all grief pointand may day by extensionsuffers from the same old shit a potential complete ignorance of ambience real ambience in that can you really construct it every last bit of it and just let the listener feel its effects and is this the right treatment always the same question in this case i would maybe say yes just because it forces form onto the thing thing as a bunch of words two melodies and the words sung in a handful of ways between j and d of course the same old war rages one into a tight and perfect digital palace

potentially horrible drawn up from airall this is no longer of any interest in fact even seeing things in this light depresses me and so i often come home at night depressed by what we have done what we are doing it s good it means i ve changed i have lost interest in music it is horrible i should only make things i understand i should only make things i know how to construct however imperfect it s not even like dictating to someone it s less than that may day itself is pretty cool i have to admit it condemns the world at such an easy pace i intend to tell t it is like a happy shooting rockets

that tried to fly through jacking me for all my faculty half of these emcees get lost in space like dr zachary i jetted for the goal line a rs kept trying to tackle me sacked me and grappled me i was too righteous of an athlete at first i was alone now there s a 1000 kids that backing me finally got a deal and now the cia is tracking me i didn t mean to do it socialism just came naturally i think it s time to meditate my sentiments exactly in the world filled with pestilence and hatred some say we ll be rescued by spaceships i stay away from crooks and study books by the ancients when the world gets too crazy hip hop helps me escape it no gravity i m weightless broke from poverty to greatness i create this and built this kick back and smell the fragrance one love one blood i got rhymes buried in my platelets you can state this grace this place this with emphasis now enter this take shots like islamic fundamentalists degenerate rappers i m smashing attacking with a passion a r bashing ripping built on fashion now imagine you just won a trip around my way full transportation all expenses paid i ve never been a player just the one who got played now my style kills more kids then roe versus wade don t be afraid to join us on this hip hop meditation where you encounter evil spirits release hip hop and let it chase them and place them over here forget the clothes that you be wearing my style is matter free i m free but don t you go comparing your weekly shopping sprees versus my bargain basement shopping your religion versus my black magic concoction taekwondo and boxing moving soldiers to my locksmith your biodegradable rhymes to my lethal toxins rhyming is a gift and not an option i gave birth to more styles then half you emcees got through adoption be careful of the and the rhymes that you be dropping cause while we meditate the whole universe is watching
