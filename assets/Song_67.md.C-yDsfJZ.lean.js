sideburns hangin down to there he wore a silver belt around his waist then with a swivel of his hip he started to curl his upper lip with a look that said merry christmas on his face then with a karate kick he whirled around i saw him write something down he took the note and he stuffed it in my sock then he put a record under the tree just before he turned to leave he hummed a bit of jailhouse rock oh he s the king the king of christmas alive and well and ridin in his sleigh and i just can t help believin well those tabloids ain t deceivin cause the king of christmas passed me on

played it while i read the words he wrote i ll outlive rock and roll and postage stamps that say i m dead and at the bottom he signed his famous name well some say the king was put to rest but me and

didn t know if she had any soul left to save and she said why d you care so i said because i did ever since i saw you standing there well i couldn t help but stare and then her eyes said don t you

people living through drama can be clowns always fishing for some problems i keep em in their anemones not to be rude it s just an observation a good life is a preferred topic of conversation times changin and now my newest fixation is having no destination and hopping off at a station and just seeing where it takes me cause what i ve realized is we re all on the same train i m in it for the ride and i m not here to decide where everything s gonna take me but i m chillin adapting to living my life lately as i stare out the window and watch all this paper peeling from the blunt lit in my hands and i get in touch with my feelings i m feeling kind of conlicted cause lately i stoped concealing and expressing just confessing the truth and it s been revealing the craziest things in life unsure if things ll be right but i m at the edge of vesuvius ready to blow tonight and just freeze everything look at all of the casts created by all the ash and build a conclusion that would just go off of what i see not sure what to believe cause i know what i want and i also know what i need and i see all of the greed from the snakes inside the green with everything up and down i m not sure to smile or scream the hardest thing to keep now is a good heart but remember that you had one from the start and to finish with maybe i know this shit is crazy but it s me dom m c and this is my life lately","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

verses 3 and 4 begins blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and god of all comfort who comforts us in all of our affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with which the comfort we ourselves are comforted by god now at this time we have someone from the family who will give words of condolences thank god for you young man yes go right ahead i can t believe that he gone when he left he took apart of me forgive me it s so hard to speak see we went from the days of playing hide and seek to being faced with the day i had to watch him leave and though memories fade his face is on my arm so he ll live on after the grave ya ll remember him for acting thug i see highwaters loafers and a jackson glove we were so young nothing could get us apart not even death he ll always live in my heart and auntie you know there was nothing that i wouldn t have did for him i was willing to die for him now i want to live for him

give him my life thank you lord i ve been running away from you too long but i m coming i hear you calling me saying come back home spoken amen amen praise the lord jesus christ that even in the midst of such an untimely tragedy the glory of god is revealed in this young man giving his life to christ and right now we have a special request from the family that a young man share his heart receive at this time marcus gray my heart goes out to the family first of all ya ll need help don t hesitate to call i ll be right here if it s just for a prayer to god or just to talk i m right here even just to wipe tears but what i wanna say there s gonna come a day for each person to die and then to face god none of us know when it s our time to go so while we all still alive just repent and embrace god not these lie s these guys telling all on the block the same lies in disguise that s got this man shot it s hard ya ll when we at this type of funeral cause usually the eulogy is where we talk nice and when we leave you sell weed and chop bricks and turn tricks until something like this flip on the lights guess what i m saying it s the same old song he loves you so much so come back home now according to our text in 2 corinthians chapter 1 we have the promise of god that he is a comforter in not just some but all of our afflictions yes and those of us who have experienced the abundant comfort through our relationship with christ are equip by the grace of god to assist in comforting this family and yes church we want to wrap our arms around them and serve them at this time of bereavement not just in word but indeed also now as i look over all of these young faces in this sanctuary there is no doubt you have been touched by the life of this young man and gripped by his death yes we are forced to hold our attention at death today though in our generation life pleasures pursuits having big things and living big dreams are more appealing topics of conversation and thought but today we face with one undisputed absolute truth of our own mortality but in 2 corinthians chapter 1 verse 9 god gives us two reasons for us to face death and our powerlessness against it number 1 that we should not trust in ourselves and number 2 that we should trust in god who raises the dead now understand we are not victims of death but death according to james is the result of our sin and rebellion against god but we are not left without hope for god sent his son jesus christ who took up all our sins and died on the cross and according to hebrews defeated death through his resurrection for all who would believe chris johnson has not died in vain there are some in this room who through the glory of christ this day will be redeemed thank you lord i ve been running away

people from sin so when he created adam he made an agreement to bless him with eternal life but adam disobeyed god and the covenant or agreement was broken then god covered adam and eve with his grace then the good news of jesus christ was proclaimed in genesis chapter three when god said that the serpent would bruise the heel but the seed of eve talkin about jesus but then jesus would crush his head so from that point god made an agreement with noah and spared his family from the judgement of the old world which was a picture of jesus christ saving us from sin then he made an agreement with abraham that his descendants would be as many as the grains of sand and that not only jews but gentiles would be blessed to be a part of his covenant people then he made a covenant with moses and then with david and through david s lineage would come jesus christ who was the promise to david that he would always have someone to sit upon his throne and then eventually jesus christ came to earth to

are climbing up and looking at my options anonymous the common denominator s a profit i am not an accommodator for any nonsense man can not live off of bread alone but yet we ve gotta eat even though

where he ll stay and his world is filled with darkness turning grey gazing out the window of the 42nd floor he is separate from all others no one knocks upon his door and it might as well be raining cause the sunlight hurts his eyes and his ears will never hear the children s cries once proud and full of passion he fought the cause of man many people loved his courage many followed his command he changed the old into the new and the course of things to come and then one day they noticed he was gone at first it didn t matter nobody seemed to care they all became too busy to find him anywhere so no one knew not even him the problems he would find on the day he journeyed deep into his mind i close my eyes i go far away away from this battlefield in my dreams well here i will enjoy it where innocence plays with all the laughing children the kind who are crying right now a taste of freedom from the pain of everything here i see life is sweet but i took it all for granted and now i don t know if i can ever tell you just what we permit we allow allow me to forget the life i ve made my own i ve held this nation in my hand and yet it s not my home allow me just one answer and one reason why why this refugee of the family of man must die tell me why  daydreams filled his nighttimes and night dreams filled his days confusion and uncertainty a puzzled mind of haze you thought he was so powerful and set upon his ways well he left us all to follow through this maze i heard the king was dying i heard the king was dead and with him died the chronicles that no one ever read the closet s fully empty now it s occupied by none i ll draw the drapes now destiny is done1","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

do yet there was a big piece missing what is existence and why gazing into the ripples of the pond he intuitively grasped the unfolding dimensions of the microcosm within the macrocosm he saw all of creation as a hologram in which all parts exist within each other he understood that the infinite has to include both everything and nothing and that the ever changing physical universe is one of the ways in which the infinite expresses itself in the finite he was shown that on the physical plane matter appears to be tangible but in scientific terms matter actually is made up of atoms that resemble tiny solar systems these can be broken down into smaller particles that resemble tinier solar systems ad infinitum so the sum total of all matter is virtually empty space he reasoned but this empty space really is invisible energy that takes shapes in such a way as to give the illusion of being matter matter exists in all dimensions but is manifest in various degrees of fineness the force that moves the energy which causes the subatomic particles to take form into matter is the same force which causes atoms planets solar systems galaxies and universes to take shape it is also the same force that causes all events to take place in a person s life and this force is thought energy is put into motion by thought and each thought frequency animates the subatomic particles which create the structure of matter and events it also became clear to him that everything which comes into being and all events in people s life are the result of the way they think and feel behind these is the power of desire when the desire thought and feeling processes are exhausted what is left is pure consciousness this consciousness is divine infinite love it is represented by the light and sound which cannot be seen or heard in the physical world they lie within the essence of consciousness and are continually resonating within every living thing and everywhere in the creation these revelations were profound but how on earth could he express all this in a scientific formula when it is something that can be perceived only by intuition unravelling the riddle would be his life s mission he knew he would discover a way if he spent his whole life thinking about it because he would create it just as his epiphany showed him was

comes through shining love always sees the light through the darkest night in a small way love always finds a way holding you near after the storm has passed it becomes clear when all our tears have finally dried that no matter how we fools may try to turn the tide love always finds a way when the clouds have no silver lining she comes through shining love always sees the light through the darkest night in a small way love always finds a way  and in those moments when the magic seems to fade we must remember then that s the time to keep on believing and not be afraid if we both trust in what we really feel the two of us can hold tomorrow in our hands all it takes is just the faith to truly understand that love always finds a way when the clouds have no silver lining she comes thru
