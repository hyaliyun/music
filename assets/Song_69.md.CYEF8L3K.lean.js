wait this out im gonna wait this out for my chance yeah the person you love and the person who loves you are never the same but nevertheless you begin to confess in convincing yourself that youre always to blame its always the same all of the faces fade all of the names have changed only the game remains the pain well it stings and it stains rain wont wash away all of the hurt so you run just to end up alone and afraid like before and you know how this ends but youll always be asking for more and theres nothing to do or to say to make up for your past you just hope itll pass you just hope for your chance fumbling words cluttered minds simple thoughts on decline soothing words off her lies one last kiss with no goodbyes no goodbyes","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"this song goes out to all

up our heels and i can hardly move my mouth to get these hallowed insults out past my bear trap jaws into my wandering father s ears so i m packing up my tattered thoughts and swallowing my prayers

before i take a shot i always make a toast to the sky blow somesmoke in the air so we both can get high at night i hold my rosarys tight and hope to get by close my eyes and ask the lord why he chose you to die though i believe in god i chose my own road cause of pride i dont abide to no bible cause most of them lie lifes like a roller coaster ride just try to hold on and drive its all about surviving one day we all gonna die i tried to hide all these feelings i was holding inside cause they always told me thugs ain t suppose to cry and show their emotional side but it soaked up my eyes cause i never had nobody really close to me die couldn t understand it at first so how do this work you were just here full of cheer now i m following your hearse its outta this earth i felt like i was damned with a curse had to light candle in church to handle the hurt in retrospect i always respect the man that you were a man of your word that always put his family first with talent superb all you wanted was to be heard and you got your chance all of your fans are proud of your work you made it outta of the dirt and got on top of the world but you still stood in the hood with your son and two little girls you in iced out chains your wife was rockin the pearls you lived a ghetto fabulous life the bronx was your borough and when the fame came you never changed you kept it so thorough we did the same thing poppin champagne to we earled you shocked the world twin every time you rapped on a track you had cats like how this fat dude could flow like that is he black is he packin the mack

got proper diction for the makings of a thug though i grew up in the ghetto and my niggas all sold drugs and though that may validate me for a spot on mtv or get me all the airplay that my bank account would need i was hoping to invest in a lesson that i learned when i thought this fool would jump me just because it was my turn i went to an open space cause i knew he wouldn t do it if somebody there could see him or somebody else might prove it and maybe in your eyes it may seem i got punked out cause i walked a narrow path and then went and changed my route but that openness exposed me to a truth i couldn t find in the clenched fist of my ego or the confines of my mind in the hipness of my swagger or the swagger in my step or the scowl of my grimace or the meanness of my rep cause we represent a truth son that changes by the hour and when you open to it vulnerability is power and in that shifting form you ll find a truth that doesn t change and that truth s living proof of the fact god is strange talk to strangers when family fails and friends lead you astray when buddha laughs and jesus weeps and it turns out god is gay cause angels and messiahs love can come in many forms in the hallways of your projects or the fat girl in your dorm and when you finally take the time to see what they re about and perhaps you find them lonely or their wisdom trips you out maybe you ll find the cycle s end you re back where you began but come this time around you ll have someone to hold your hand who prays for you who s there for you who sends you love and light exposes you to parts of you that you once tried to fight and come this time around you ll choose to walk a different path you ll embrace what you turned away and cry at what you laughed cause that s the only way we re going to make it through this storm where ignorance is common sense and senselessness the norm and flags wave high above the truth and the two never touch and stolen goods are overpriced and freedom costs too much and no one seems to recognize the symbols come to life the bitten apple on the screen and jesus had a wife and she was his messiah like that stranger may be yours who holds a subtle knife that carves through worlds like magic doors and that s what i ve been looking for the bridge from then to now just watching bet like what the fuck son this is foul but that square box don t represent the sphere that we live in the earth is not a flat screen i ain t trying to fit in but this ain t for the underground this here is for the sun a seed a stranger gave to me and planted on my tongue and when i look at you i know i m not the only one as a great man once said there s nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"from a county mayo

he ll give you the desires of your heart he never failed anyone who trusted him that s real rap commit your way to god by faith he will act christ s righteousness in us shining radiantly be still before the lord waiting patiently these people are lifeless with evil devices but eternal life in christ jesus is priceless and he changed us so we could refrain from anger against deranged strangers who remain in danger of god s wrath because they don t cherish his worth or share in this birth the meek shall inherit the earth child of god don t let the wicked get you upset their time is temporary just like a sublet yeah they re acting out right now and they got jokes but soon enough they ll all vanish away like smoke they re on the path to regrets but for the one whom the master directs yes the lord will establish his steps i ve been around a while now a lot of lives have been taken but never have i seen the righteous forsaken but i saw a wicked man once come to my town running around stunting with a thunderous sound time passed and he wasn t to be found you wondering how it s quite simple he was under the ground but for those who make christ crucified their foundation they ll find out that from the lord is salvation trust in god he ll never leave you all alone oh no he won t","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i survive jah jah watch over i evil what you what you sonna do yeh jah jah

head welcomed the ground cursing in vain but my words offer no sound i am lost in the spiral my shame is stronger than desire for survival an angel pushed me when i was pulling away despite my best attempts she decided to stay trapped in the cracks of an empty shell on borrowed time that was spent in hell the sum of all my fears strung out over seven long long years drugs traverse my veins and leave me clutching the numb my voice flies away further from my useless tongue i sit quiet and still and hear worms eating the church maybe i believe them but i m drunk from drinking my words i am lost in the spiral my shame is stronger than desire for survival an angel pushed me when i was pulling away despite my best attempts she decided to stay trapped in the cracks of an empty shell on

me speak the words tonight span the void inside seven years without a voice seven months away from my side seven spirals into the void but it ends now it ends tonight  i won t drag you down anymore i am more than dead weight floating adrift but i could never feel it brush my lips you ask me to span the void inside but i believe my borrowed time s run dry i won t drag you down anymore speak i wear my past as the scars on my feet seven years without a voice seven months away from my side seven spirals into the void but it ends now it ends tonight seven years without a voice seven months away
