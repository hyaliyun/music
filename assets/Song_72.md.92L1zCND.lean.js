a small town you were from a small town we became the best of friends where our story begins is where our trouble begins i never had a dime to my name you liked playing games a local pizza place had a deal 10 coupons got a free 12inch well heres what we did you see the college kids they never cut the coupons out wed dig through the trash and find them a few nights work put pizza in our mouths we started to wonder where the coupons went after people turned them in so we looked in their dumpster and what did we find we found 140 of them sooner then later we started making our own when kinkos got the red copy machine one day they busted me the manager said we don t take photocopies so i jumped into the car told the driver to drive as we sped off into the night we yelled free pizza for life free pizza for life free pizza for life free pizza for life a few years later you dropped outta school we both spent a few months in our home town we ve both been down and out but we were doing our best to get back up now one night we were sleeping in my van it was fourteen degrees below i woke up because i heard something crack you said it was your foot frozen to the window our desperation drove us to dishonesty we were criminals distinctive and vile declared most of the world to be our enemy we stole checkbooks and credit cards signed signatures that were not ours slice after slice we ate pizza every night we always shared it with our friends gave the driver a mighty tip in our simple minds we had a slice of a paradise but i guess we took it a little too far cause you ended up doing some time when they slammed the door to your cell i swear i heard you yell free pizza for life free pizza for life free pizza for life free pizza for life on the night that we bailed you out of jail it was 2 weeks later you looked scared and pale to celebrate setting you free we ordered some pizza and paid with forgery cause when they knock you down you can t stay on the ground you gotta keep getting up you gotta keep putting your faith in luck and as we can clearly see that we made some mistakes for the most part i have no regrets at some parts i feel a little ashamed but it all worked out okay in the end and i think i would do it all over again sorry your the one they caught i wish it coulda been me my friend i m not saying we were wrong and i m not saying we were right all

feared the name of ringo i knew someday i d face the test which one of us would be the best and sure enough the word came down that he was holed up in the town i left the posse out in the street and i went in alone to meet ringo they said my speed was next to none but my lightning draw had just begun when i heard a blast that stunned my wrist the gun went flying from my fist and i was looking down the bore of the deadly 44 of ringo  they say that was the only time that anyone had seen him smile he slowly lowered his gun and then he said to me we re even friend and so at last i understood that there was still a spark of good in ringo i blocked the path of his retreat he turned and stepped into the street a dozen guns spit fire and lead a moment later he lay dead the town began to shout and cheer nowhere was there shed a tear for ringo the story spread throughout the land that i had beaten ringo s hand and it was just the years they say that made me put my guns away but on his grave they

found the words left a note i ll see you soon you re a star lost on me and there s no moon make you smile in denial you undo undo you heavenly in my dreams i just sleep sing it back i can t speak

hit single we can push they like to give advice girl the whole idea s too risky don t think about it twice girl the audience won t understand this kind of thing it s time to get to work i disagree why

easy i think we ought to talk seriously about this financing it is not why take chances a vision s just a vision if it s only in your head nobody respects your artistic integrity more than i do but if no one gets to hear it it s as good as dead you have to think about your career it has to come to life bit by bit putting it together piece by piece only way to make a work of art every moment makes a contribution every little detail plays a part having just a vision s no solution everything depends on execution putting it together that s what counts ounce by ounce putting it together small amounts adding up to make a work of art first of all you need a good foundation otherwise it s risky from the start takes a little cocktail conversation but without the proper preparation having just a vision s no solution everything depends on execution the art of making art is putting it together bit by bit do we really need all these musicians link by link making the connections yes we do drink by drink taking every comment as it comes learning how to play the politician like you play piano bass and drums otherwise you ll find your composition isn t gonna get much exhibition art isn t easy every minor detail is a major decision have to keep things in scale have to hold to your vision why don t we talk about this over dinner darling what s a little cocktail conversation if it gets the funds for your foundation every time i start to feel defensive i remember vinyl is expensive now would you agree to do an interview maybe one dot by dot building up the image shot by shot keeping at a distance doesn t pay still if you remember your objective not give all your privacy away a little bit of hype can be effective as long as you can keep it in perspective even when you get some recognition everything you do you still audition art isn t easy overnight you re a trend you re the right combination then the trend s at an end you re suddenly last year s sensation all they ever want is repetition all they really like is what they know gotta keep a link with your tradition gotta learn to trust your intuition while you re establish your position so that you can be on exhibit so that your work can be on exhibition be new girl they tell you till they re blue girl you re new or else you re through girl and even if it s true girl you do what you can do bit by bit putting it together piece by piece working on the vision night and day all it takes is time and perseverance with a little luck along the way putting in a personal appearance gathering supporters and adherents well she s an original was mapping out the songs but in addition harmonizing each negotiation balancing the part that s all musicians with the part that s strictly presentation balancing the money with the mission till you have the perfect orchestration even if you do have the suspicion that it s taking all your concentration the art of making art is putting it together bit by bit beat by beat

die why did you abandon me why did you walk away and leave me bitterly yearning her haunting contorted despair was etched into the wood s grain though fire rages within me no fire burns fiercer than

behind the control board and he was very different tonight cause he was not human he was not human the little boy s face lit up with such naked joy that the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns white lids white opals seeing everything just a little bit too clearly and he looked around and there was no black ship in sight no black funeral cars nothing except for him the

human you are not human but nobody heard the boy s cry of alarm nobody there except for the birds around the new england farm and they gathered in all directions like roses they scattered and they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet slit in his nose and all the others went shooting and he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of blake grabbing at his cheeks taking out his neck all his limbs everything was twisted and he said i won t give up won t give up don t let me give up i won t give up come here let me go up fast take me up quick take

the mid nightmare trampling of dreams but oh no tears please fear and pain may accompany death but it is desire that shepherds its certainty as we shall see she was divinity s creature that kissed in cold mirrors a queen of snow far beyond compare lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere dark liquored eyes an arabian nightmare she shone on watercolors of my pond life as pearl until those who couldn t have her cut her free of this world that fateful eve when the breeze stank of sunset and camphor their lanterns chased phantoms and threw an inquisitive glance like the shadows they cast on my love picking rue by the light of the moon putting reason to flight or to death is their way they crept through woods mesmerized by the taffeta ley of her hips that held sway over all they surveyed save a mist on the rise a deadly blessing to hide her ghost in the fog they raped and left five men of god her ghost in the fog dawn discovered her there beneath the cedar s stare silk dress torn her raven hair flown to gown her beauty bared was starred with frost i knew her lost i wept til tears crept back to prayer she d sworn me vows in fragrant blood never to part lest jealous heaven stole our hearts then this i screamed come back to me for i was born in love with thee so why should fate stand in between and as i drowned her gentle curves with dreams unsaid and final words i espied a gleam trodden to earth the church bell tower key the village mourned her by the by for she d been a witch their men had longed to try and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs my tortured soul on ice a queen of snow far beyond compare lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere trappistine eyes an arabian nightmare she was erzulie possessed of a milky white skin my porcelain yin a graceful angel of sin and so for her the breeze stank of sunset and camphor my lantern chased her phantom and blew their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain best reserved for judgement that their bible construed putting reason to flight or to flame unashamed i swept from cries mesmerized by the taffeta ley or her hips that held sway over all those at bay save a mist on the rise a final blessing to

chicago sometimes we d get it as early as late august it was the big book of wishes hopes and desires my three brothers and i were allotted twenty five bucks a piece including tax so i d make up a different christmas list every night from the first of september til the twenty forth of december matter of fact let me present you with my christmas credentials when i was three years old at least that s what my mother told me i ate an entire ornament i ate a big red one i thought it was an apple they kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital but they couldn t stop me from laughing so they just left me alone so i guess i still got that christmas in me all the time you know one year i got a wooden roly poly for christmas you know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up they made em out of wood back then that s how old i am nowadays they make em out of plastic my mom says they just don t make em like that anymore and i says no ma they don t then there was the year i came home only eave from the army from germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after christmas my little brother billy who was twelve at the time had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some christmas presents for his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket billy had a job selling subscriptions for the chicago tribune he told me this guy named rocky would pick him up in a station wagon him and some other boys and he d take em out to some strange neighborhood and drop em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential customers supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation s capital washington d c but he couldn t go on the trip if his older brother wouldn t accompany him so if you would please buy a subscription to the chicago tribune then my little brother will be happy wow what a shyster some people ll do anything to get to the whitehouse then there was the year that my mom and dad gave

ground in the hall by the closet door they creep into my bed without a sound on a cube in a plastic egg a hundred fabric figures in a pile see them march toward me in a line and dance across the floor in single file little faces keep no track of time little faces speaking out in rhyme little faces smiling in my mind tiny doors for walking through while sticky fingers clutch forbidden things and the phone for talking through they often pull the cable when it rings sinking ships in the foamy sea that roll and tumble slowly from the motion of their filthy little hands their little hands little faces keep no track of time little faces speaking out in rhyme little faces smiling in my mind in the dark when their eyes are wide they listen to the secrets that i tell in a ball on their tiny beds or beneath them where the shadow people dwell and the moon beams that split the night leave bars of yellow pasted on their faces as they drift into a dream in a dream little faces keep no track of time little faces speaking out in rhyme little faces smiling in my mind","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"billy came back from vietnam just a shadow of a man he was a shadow of a man when he came back

something grinning at me and i wanted to know was it funny was it so funny it followed me down the street greeting everybody like the good humor man and they got the taste of good humor but no ice cream it was like that me talking across people into the houses and not seeing the beings crowding around me with ice picks you could see them but they looked like important negroes on the way to your funeral looked like important jiggaboos on the way to your auction and let them chant the numbers and use an ivory pointer to count your teeth remember steppen fetchit remember steppen fetchit how we laughed and all your sunday school images giving flesh and jiggling with the ice pick high off his head made ya laugh anyway i can see something in the way of ourselves i can see something in the way

teeth flying against our necks you see something too but can t call its name ain t it too bad y all said ain t it too bad such a nice boy always kind to his mother always said good morning to everybody on his way to work but that last time before he got locked up and hurt real bad i seen him walkin toward his house and he wasn t smiling and he didn t even say hello but i knew he d seen something something in the way of things that it worked on him like it do in will and he kept marching faster and faster away from us and never even muttered a word then the next day he was gone you wanna know what you wanna know what i m talkin about sayin i seen something in the way of things and how the boy s face looked that day just before they took him away the is in that face and remember
