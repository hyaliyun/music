where we stay i was running around while mama was drinking everyday but it s okay i wouldn t have it any other way cause it developed me into the young man that you see today through dedication yeah yeah never follow traditions you see i had a different vision i would skip school and write compositions bout my home conditions you know the usual no money and family division in specific i remember this time in my kitchen with my sister s man back before he went to prison and got into religion he showed me how to cook crack at 12 and i ain t kiddin after releasing him with bahe no longer living and i m pretty sure his last breath was lord forgive him now my nephew ain t got a father that ll keep him safe all i can hope is he a good boy for his mama s sake cause she never did recover from his father s fate and if he grew into a man that made the same mistake well to be honest i don t know how much more she could take so to every baby mama that could truly relate it is you unto this song

that little railroad train began to chug along the little engine up in front was heard to sing this song choo choo choo choo choo choo choo choo i feel so good today oh hear the track oh clickety clack i ll go my merry way the little train went rousing on so fast it seemed to fly until it reached a mountain that went almost to the sky the little engine moaned and groaned and huffed and puffed away but halfway to the top it just gave up and seemed to say i can t go on i can t go on i m weary as can be i can t go on i can t go on this job is not for me the toys got out to push but all in vain alas alack and then a great big engine came a whistling down the track they asked if it would kindly pull them up the mountain side but with a high and mighty sneer it scornfully replied don t bother me don t bother me to pull the likes of you don t bother me don t bother me i ve better things to do the toys all started crying cause that engine was so mean and then there came another one the smallest ever seen but though it seemed that she could hardly pull herself along she hitched on to the train and as she pulled she sang this song i think i can i think i can i think i have a plan and i can do most anything if i only think i can then up that great big mountain with the cars all full of toys and soon they reached the waiting arms of happy girls and boys and though that ends the story it will do you lots of good to take a lesson from the little engine that could just think you can just think you can and have that understood and very soon you ll start to say i always knew i

like a peddler just op ning his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when laughed like a bowl full of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk and laying a finger to the side of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh and to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight merry christmas to all and to all goodnight

all mouth the words to save face it s 11 15 on sunday morning and i wish i was on a corner in memphis listening to the old man singing out his sorrows laying down his pride he s telling me his story or at least his side no need to pretend and nowhere to hide cause we are all broken here and we are all ashamed i couldnt fool you if i wanted to our stories are too much the same and what about this jesus they say he drank with the poor the blind and the lame do you think he d like the songs that we sing or would he feel the same as i do what if sunday school was on saturday night on a corner in memphis listening to the old man singing out his sorrows laying down his pride he s telling me his story or at least his side with no need to pretend and nowhere to hide on a corner in memphis what if their heart breaking cries of pain are the first hymns of tomorrow s saints  on a corner in memphis we re singing with the old man crying for his sorrows and laying down our pride he s telling us our story or at least his side with no need to pretend and nowhere to hide on a corner in memphis we re singing out our sorrows he s telling us our story with no need to pretend and nowhere to hide on a

straighten up she said she was gonna straighten up she got a little job to help him out with the bills too but that was just a sham because he found it again and again and seven times he left this woman and seven times he came back oh but you know the heart can take so much that s right you can kick a dog around for so long and he ll get tired he ll turn and he taken all that he could stand in the eighth time that this went down he said mama i ve got to go with tears in his eyes he said i m gonna leave you baby he said i ain t coming back he said i m leaving my heart right here but i ve got to go you see cause this man can t take no more she didn t believe it he packed his clothes he got in his 1965 ford he started out three times he started to turn back before he reached the outskirts of the city but he kept on going oh i don t wanna go but i ve got to leave you mama and he s going down the highway i guess it was around 3 30 in the morning he could not hardly see the road with tears in his eyes that s right he was crying there were meaning in his tears he cannot barely see the sign that read on the side of the road the next town is 125 miles away and these very words came into his mind he said by the time i get to phoenix she ll be rising oh and she ll find a note i left hanging on her door she ll laugh when she reads the part that says i m leavin yes she will why cause i ve left that girl so many times before oh by the time i make albuquerque she ll be workin and she ll probably stop at lunch just to give her her sweet good thing a call and oh she ll hear oh

could ever provide proof to quench my mind and now i wonder whose sky i m under is there a heaven waiting for me when i die no one right answer spirit seems broken still i can t help but wonder why seems like a tragic waste of time who cares what happens when you die life s too short to wonder why get on with your life so many questions i can t tell the difference too many abstract thoughts now wrestle in my mind through the darkness somewhere should be waiting a final truth to shower me with light their pearls of wisdom and tales of glory they fed me nicely until i found it was all a lie no
