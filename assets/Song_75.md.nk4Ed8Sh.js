running with us and she beat us to the finish as we ran through the fields you were born in the city and i didn t recognize you your beauty unexpected like a flower in the concrete some gods far below in worlds undiscovered set you up to ruin temples to find me on the streets yeah i m an alias of who i am a counterfeited fake in the picture i am kneeling like a dying saint jerome hurling rocks at the demons who tried to come too near till you came in and possessed me now i feel at home i remember the time i walked for seven hours and thought about the people i had known for so long all the castles i had built out of fine and precious sand till you came in like the tide now i don t care that they are gone as we floated up the river i translated the verses that were written on memorials to the ships that had sank and i thought about the people that traded sinking for uncertainty and drowned because of loneliness before they reached the banks on a beach near barcelona the young girls cry for mary and they bury earthen vessels in the rocks by the sea i am sending out a bottle with a prayer upon the waves that you ll find inside my picture and your memory will unfold me we were talking about a trip that i had taken to the canyons and you told me of a river that had cut through time leaving only the pictures of long dead sons and daughters and you told that the paintings looked a lot like mine i try and watch myself to see what i am saying but my heart is on my collar and i m asking you to take it i don t want to go back to the way things were before before the dawn turns into morning i want you there to break it and a thousand years from now when our names are just a memory and poets have recorded what happened in the past lovers loving in the night will find our forms in constellations seekers seeking for salvation will find our stories in the stained glass a boy in the city who has never seen the morning as he s running arm in arm with you through the fields will be caught unexpected by a flower in the concrete it will all return again just like a potter s

their lives together sure was gonna be rough they never did like mama s home made dress papa s bank book wasn t big enough he was standing at the side of the road rain falling on his shoes heading out for the old east coast radio blasting the news straight on through tangled up in blue she was married when they first met to a man four times her age he left her penniless in a state of regret it was time to bust out of the cage and they drove that car as far as they could abandoned it out west splitting up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best she turned around to look at him as he was walking away saying i wish i could tell you all the things that i never learned to say he said that s all right baby i love you too but we were tangled up in blue he had a steady job and a pretty face and everything seemed to fit one day he could just feel the waste he put it all down and split and he drifted down to new orleans where they treated him like a boy he nearly went mad in baton rouge he nearly drowned in delacroix but all the while he was alone the past was close behind he had one too many lovers and none of them were too refined all except for you but you were tangled up in blue  she was working in the blinding light and i stopped in for a drink i just kept looking at her face so white i didn t know what to think later on when the crowd thinned out i was getting ready to leave she was standing there right beside my chair saying what s that you got up your sleeve i said nothing baby and that s for sure she leaned down into my face i could feel the heat and the pulse of her as she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe tangled up in blue i lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs there was snow all winter and no heat revolution was in the air and one day all of his slaves ran free something inside of him died the only thing i could do was be me and get on that train and ride and when it all came crashing down i was already south i didn t know whether the world was flat or round i had the worst taste in my mouth that i ever knew tangled up in blue so now i m going on back again maybe tomorrow or maybe next year i gotta find someone among the women and men whose destiny is unclear some are masters of illusion some are ministers of the trade all of the strong delusion all of their beds are unmade me i m still heading towards the sun

beware of lightning that might strike i havent known peace and quiet for so long i cant remember what its like theres a lone soldier on the cross smoke pouring out of a boxcar door you didnt know it you didnt think it could be done in the final end he won the war after losing every battle  i woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars you hurt the ones that i love best and cover up the truth with lies one day youll be in the ditch flies buzzing around your eyes blood on your saddle idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb blowing through the curtains in your room idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth youre an idiot babe its a wonder that you still know how to

cant remember your face anymore your mouth has changed your eyes dont look into mine the priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone faced while the building burned i waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the springtime turned slowly into autumn idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull from the grand coulee dam to the capitol idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth youre an idiot babe its a wonder that you still know how to breathe i cant feel you anymore i cant even touch the books youve read every time i crawl past your door i been wishing i ve been somebody else instead down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy i followed you beneath the stars hounded by your memory and all your raging glory i been double crossed now for the very last time and now im finally free i kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me youll never know the hurt i suffered nor the pain i rise above and ill never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love and it makes me feel so sorry idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats blowing through the letters that we

willing to listen but the story and the reasons for writing this song were even more interesting to me than the song the old friend and fellow i m speaking of is tommy collins tommy told me about an experience he had when he was a minister where he was called to preach a funeral for a man with no identity tommy said he never forgot the way he felt like here is a human being who someone must have loved at sometime and yet there was no one present to pay respect just a couple of grave diggers a funeral man and tommy then the story switched to another thought about during his last visit to nashville he went down to listen to an old street singer that he always made a point to go hear each time he was in town and it was then that tommy discovered that jack dupree the old street singer had passed away and tommy said he wondered how many were present at jack s funeral and it was these two true to life incidents that inspired this song i only saw five people when they buried jack dupree two diggers and a preacher a funeral man and me the prayer was said and the hole was filled in less than half an hour and i said goodbye to the little man who picked the wildwood flower for twenty years i d seen him on the lower nashville streets they said he always earned enough to buy his clothes and eats he d stop awhile and check his watch with the big clock on the tower that s when i asked him once if he could pick the wildwood flower he always drew a crowd because he put on such a show he d dance and sing and play and smile just like a polished pro and every time he saw me standing in the crowd i knew the tune that he d play next would be the wildwood flower i told him once that he could be what people call a star and he said why boy i m happy how many of them folks are i d hate to have to force a smile and feel myself turn sour there ain t no put on in my face when i pick the wildwood flower then i saw a thousand people as they began to come business men and opry

the thought of my unaccomplished aims knowing all my best laid plans might leave me reeling and empty handed vicious circles are a false sense of progression every wrong turn one step further from my goal furthering the distance in my mind the path less travelled is one ive feared to walk but hesitation is a dead end road it seems ive always run away turned my back on uncertainty a life spent being led astray will never amount to anything until my reflection shows me that the hands that held me back are none but my own my heart will never be another unrequited dream ill travel the earth and seas to find a heart that beats for me and though the winds will change ill find new strength to fill my sails each growing breath one final push to carry me home searching for so long just to find what was right in front of me all this time it takes so much just to open up your eyes and when you feel like you re alone look for strength to find your way back home and carry on nothing comes

see him strike like thunder before lightning goes the tiger burning through the night tear into the empty world howl back at the sound of the void as tame as the wildest dream as soft as the loudest scream two eyes blink like stars in the dark a shudder of light that you drink and are marked the fear drips like blood from his teeth the fear drips like blood from his teeth beneath him just violent thoughts streaks of memories prey he forgot his castle of gristle and bone the king sits on his throne afraid and alone between the earth and the sky a struggle on both sides the tiger lives afraid as the tiger dies chasing shadows across the sun streaks of light he can t outrun cut through the darkness like the shot from the hunter s gun stalking a naked terrain at the top of his barren chain no one left to remember his name so he kills again lash out at the unknown rank that is grown on the bone a company of order and flesh his foul caress he rips the sun right out of the sky clawing tears in the haze as the dark fills his eyes blind to a merciless god smothered by the facade he ll take you before you can see him strike like thunder before lightning goes the tiger burning through the night the king of the shortest stick the beast above with one last trick sovereign of his defeat in the end it was bittersweet prostrate in a royal cower the cat is a mouse to the eyes in the tower his blood falls from the highest plateau above as it is below it takes him before he can see pulls his shadow away right from under his feet now the darkness is a part of the light as the tiger goes burning in the night between the earth and the sky a struggle on both sides the tiger lives afraid as the tiger dies chasing shadows across the sun streaks of light he can t outrun cut through the darkness like the shot from a hunter s gun who is the beast and who are the spoils who makes the trees grow up from the soil and charges the sky with imperious fire brutes in the dark afraid of the sire who is this beautiful beast a tear of light on his teeth a fearful smile on his face tokens of blood leave a trace whimper and bowed to the ground a scornful sun bearing down grimace and howl through the pain get up get shot down again light drips like paint from heaven a shining pall on the horizon life weeps away from his frame stretched to the bone by the flame corrupt the stripes on his back and burn the white into black iron imprisons his rage violent stains colour a cage so filled with sorrow so filled with hate otherwise empty a relic of grace shot like an arrow his fateful arc he ll charge until he s lost in the dark bring down the father who brought down the son a blinding madness he won t overcome strike out in anger eclipsed by fear his last breath wasted the end is near remember life as a king the coil of life in the spring the silver stare of the stars before the snare of the bars that deathly coddle of light cut through the space of the night so say goodbye
