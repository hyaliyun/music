street value than a bike is candy and if you re selling the right product you best believe james is buying word on the street was james had been living with some old guy named mr kane nobody knew much of anything about mr kane except that james was selling the stolen bikes right out of the old guy s shed anyways me and mike wanted our bikes back and we wanted them back now see james was moving bikes so quick that if you didn t get to him within a couple of weeks it s a good chance your bike had already been sold well it had been a year since me and mike had our bikes stolen but i had a good feeling that our bikes were locked up in mr kane s shed with the rest of with the dave i can t i can t read your stinking writing what does that even say it had been a whole year since our bikes got stole and i ran that go kart into a telephone pole we hated james but this just made us hate more cause for the last year we ve been riding skateboards friggin skateboards i would rather walk do i look like tony hawk that s what i thought do i look like rob dyrdek thank god do i look like brad pitt are you sure we knew exactly where james hid the bikes at they were stashed in the shed right out back we threw on our bulletproof vests and our snapbacks and we plotted our attack and ate snak paks i told mike grab the sling shot take this sock and fill it with about sixteen rocks meet me at the spot in about ten minutes and mike don t forget the spinach  hey you stop freeze hands in the air get down on your knees don t make us have to fight back cause you won t really like that we just want

the shed while visions of pedal bikes danced in our heads all through the town kids lined the streets they couldn t wait to see james get beat we got to the shed and we kicked down the door two guards came out and they both had swords but my homeboy mike was there to save the day he fired two rocks and he blew them away but hold up cause it wasn t over yet james snuck up and he punched me in the head grabbed mike s hair and he punched him in the eyebrow he said i m keeping all the bikes cause they re mine now we were losing bad and we were getting laughed at but then mike pulled something out his backpack of course that old can of spinach i looked at james and said you re finished hey you stop freeze hands in the air get down on your knees don t make us have to fight back cause you won t really like that we just want our bikes back hey you stop freeze hands in the air get down on your knees don t make us have to fight back cause you won t really like that we just want our bikes back

first base and i just can t escape i m in bad shape you making love to someone else is more than i can take and so i make all the movement i can to no avail scream and yell sinkin deeper into my personal hell i m getting heated i m sorry have another coffee i needed to release my sparrow chest from just a piece of this pressure unless an escape route is found i m going down underground into lifetimes of pain it s absurd the heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word so i m referred back to hell huh just as well i hate needles an get twinges at the thought of syringes j i m going insane with shame i dream and watch her makin love over and over again with what i call a farmer s swain unintelligent pea brained retard who s dick is always hard oh god of course i m jealous fellows oversexed flexing his pec s jesus what s he going make her do next i m mad vex the way she gently scratches his chest you used to do that to me back in 1253 pity me while you lie with your lover i stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair unaware of who else is there i move quick i want to try my trick one last time you know it s possible to vaguely define my outline when dust move in the sunshine so i m tryin to change vibrate myself to near human pitch which reminds me how i used to come unstitched and switch round the house in a blind rage it took years and an ocean of tears to find the key to this cage and write another stage into a new age it s difficult to gauge but i know that i ll see you again on that you may depend i just don t know how or when sleep on my

smiling bold as the dawn how did it shine despite this crumbling world i heard the timberwolves out there howling a lonely old song that rag upon the leaves those notes i will never forget the days begin to slide like mud from the cold winter slopes the nights played to the black birds in my beard and in the days played to the grey ones up in the canyons where we used to make love far from the city streets tear drops falling like blood from her eyes she said things will never blow our way again the wind blew slow through the aching pines and rolled around her beautiful hair and she said no man i ll never be your wife and i got a man who wants to kill you went east from the ocean into pepperwood layed in the orchard with the rotting fruit drinking cans of beer all afternoon sometimes late before the sun got too old i saw a dust cloud rising up across a field into the forest with the cold moss and mold from behind me i heard the pounding of earth and i went on into that black hole ran all night like a small town dog until the muddy slew met the tide and upon me i smelled the whisky and cold sweat and he began to kill me dead my legs were sinking in the silt and mud my chest to the rising tide with hi sboot on my shoulder and his pistol to my chest he took my life in a flash i recall how the dawn used to come goodbye love i may see you again but probably not for a long while all young men sleep easy in the mud beneath the midnight rain all love flows to the ocean without a trail or trace all young men sleep easy in the mud beneath the midnight rain all love flows to the

anywhere you can draw your own map  a yawn tells my mom that it s time for bed but with a touch of pixie dust i can fly instead i m bound to leave the ground so i open up the windows of my room and look towards space to face the moon that s becoming a balloon in an old cartoon it must be wacky wednesday cause i see my favorite sensei and there s the groovie goolies who are rockin with pippi longstocking and her papa as little hiawatha hit the stream for a swim i had my scuba gear near so i followed him in and grabbed a hold of the tail of a manta ray and we began to play but then he swam away so i boogied on my board using an oar to head back to the shore where i can boogie on a floor i did the penguin to the shuffle to the hustle to a back spin and then i heard my pet rock named schleprock who slept in a tube sock was going a couple rounds with a rock em sock em robot but i couldn t get a ticket so i had to sneak in then i jumped on my psycho stick and hopped the top of a suburb curb man i gotta move quick cause if i hurry up and get the magetti ready i ll return home a hero and be showered with confetti and climb aboard this cruise to the state of no limits and bring your sleep walkin shoes it s not an acquittal so we don t beat the rap on a journey to anywhere we can draw our own map on a journey to anywhere you can draw your own

swerved nearly ran me down i looked in the drivers seat i swear to god it was doc brown he said are you michael j fox i said no im johnny fox he said yeah that s close enough you best get inside cause im taking you with me to see another time a place you could only have dreamed of in your mind it s an alternative reality situated just outside of clapham so strap yourself in cause where were going you dont need roads to get to where punk never happened we landed in a concrete desert rubble as far as the eye could see i says to doc where we going doc says hes following me we found the only building in the city that was left standing it was my local venue i know cause i recognized the landing and theres a gig on tonight this town aint so bad i got everything i need right here in this pad so i pulled out a bottle and took a heroic swig made myself comfortable and got ready for the gig well an hour after doors and there was still no one there the sound man was on acid the fucking long hair and the bands never showed cause they didn t see the point when all the kids are at home still smoking a joint they wont go out and do nothing man not on your nelly theyre just watching the telly and then their feeding their belly their parents listen to the beatles while they listen to nirvana green day and the pistols well they never heard either they got long sleeve t shirts they never shower man they still believe in flower power yeah the hippy dreams faded but they got nothing new so they wear flares and slippers and burn incense sticks too the kids would rather skate than go out and smash the state while their parents sit still and meditate man actions at a low when people just dont care they zoned out to their surroundings the angers not there and im stuck in this hippy grunge reality where the buildings are crumbling down from apathy yeah they grab you at school when youve just turned 13 and show you your brand new life long routine you can sleep and work and work and sleep so you can save up the money to buy a new jeep so you can sleep and work and work and sleep then sleep then work then work then sleep i pulled a fanzine out my back pocket held it in my hands and watched the colors slowly fade away the words bled right off of the pages til it had nothing left to say i banged on the jukebox but it was useless it had no good records on not even something weak like the best punk album in the world ever volume 1 and outside the windows i saw the excavators coming to tear the place down no one stopped them for there is no community left in this town theres no one around to fight margaret thatcher the power of the flower just couldnt match her too strong was the will of parliament to cause damage that with no punk rock everything went unchallenged land got knocked down to build more land that got knocked down again for a couple more grand with no punk the protests were full of throwbacks calling each other comrade of course the young folks attendance started to fade so it was easy for the police to move in they were trusted and thats when the whole damn town got busted they moved cctv cameras in everywhere but the people were too apathetic to care they made them carry id cards to state where theyre from as if by being born they had done something wrong they shipped all the poor folk to live out in the edges so the rich folk could move in and peer over their hedges but before you leave youd better build our homes there weve done you a favor now youre on your own this aint your home no more go find somewhere new i know you aint got the money cause its me who employs you i know everything about you what you eat how you dress your hobbies your turn ons and your email address while i had you working in the dark you didnt realize that i completely stopped your ability to organize i didnt let you have a reason to communicate i banned punk rock knowing you hippies would seal your own fate i controlled everything you wrote everything you created i distracted you with advertisements so you forgot what you hated i fed your dark side kept you consuming and competing and like a dog that doesnt know when to stop eating you took it all oh and long was it my intention you could have beat me if punk rock was your invention instead the city will be sold to the highest bids if only sham 69 had of united the kids if only the 4 skins had told us acab if only the ramones had let us know we were a happy family if only the buzzcocks had shown us how to do it ourself if only crass had shown us there are things more important than wealth if only the vandals had shown us it was ok to smile if only the dead kennedys had helped us put our government on trial if only rancid had played live and brought

streets this turf is your turf dont let anyone tell you that youve got to give in cause you can make a difference you can change everything let your dreams be your pilot your imagination your fuel tear up the book and write your own damn rules use all that heart hope and soul that youve got and the love and the rage that you feel in your gut and realize that the other world that youre always

life all i knew was we was tight so i never thought twice that everything i wanted was everything he had he said life was to short so take everything you can forget the next man only think about yourself i ll give you all the power and i ll bring you all the wealth i wanted nothing more but to be a player in the game he filled me up with hate and shot rage up through my veins an overnight change it all happen so fast first i was outside playing catch now i m slanging twenty sacks watching my money stack this has got to be the life he said the world could be mine if i was down to pay the price i was like where do i sign it ll cost you your soul i got to gets mine so hommie lets roll chorus my best friend is now my worst enemy now i think he s after me i think he wants to kill me every step that you take every move that you make i can feel him moving closer my life he may take x2 best friends till the end you said you d be down with me living a life of sin that s how it should be all enemies shall perish cause you taught me how to fight you showed me how to kill if anyone crossed the line the first time i got high you put the joint to my lip you put the straw to my nose and took my head for a sip now every move that i take you tell me which way to go and every move that i make you tell me if i m moving too slow now everyone that i know considers you a friend they all took you in and we introduced them to sin i ve been getting second thoughts of this life i ve been leading he said there s no way out so don t think about leaving i m sitting here with my hommie who was hurting in pain he whispered in his ear suicides the way now i blame you for his death for you i just feel hate i gotta get away but i m locked in these chains like an animal in a cage i felt i was trapped i couldn t get away cause he was always on my back and like that a man appeared and his name was christ he said he d set me free if i d give him my life i said where do i sign cause i m ready to roll he said my life for your life and the price is your soul i felt so betrayed once he opened my eyes cause i saw my best friend was the devil in disguise chorus my best friend is now my worst enemy now i think he s after me i think he wants to kill me every step that you take every move that you make i can feel him moving closer my life he may take x2 he was my best friend but became my worst rival i learned to fight him from my bible cause its the art of survival i can t deny all the facts that i m the prey being hunted i feel i m under attack i m like a hundred miles and running i can hear him coming in my room in the middle of the night then he tries to go into my dreams and fill me with fright i try to fight for my life not to fall into sin but he knows what i like so he tries to lure me back in he s been hanging with my boys i try to tell them but they don t listen that there s a killer on the prowl and they can be the next victim i can t get him out my life he tries to pump me with fear i m shadow boxing in the air cause i can feel his presence near but there s a man before me who will fight my fights i m protected from my enemy when i call the name christ now he strikes with vengeance he s out to seek and destroy but i have a hedge of protection so as now i can deploy the joy of victory sometimes only last but a minuit and he s steadily hitting me so this war went right back to business to win it gotta get it the power of the blood triple six ain t got no love now my enemies on the run ain t gonna stop till the war is won this ones is personal for all the

tales and sweetest dreams she found jesus on her own and he told her that he loved her and that he would be her home and he danced and sang his songs over her as she slept at night and she felt his joy and she felt his peace his gentleness and his might and she believed that he bore a pain and that he bore it in his side but to believe that he loved her so was just so much that she would hide for his love was too dangerous and how could he dare to love her the unlovable it just didn t seem fair and i fell in love with her creativity and the paintings that flowed from her hands for a time she invited me in happily we danced in her lands and i saw in the forest her enemies the giants the ogres the evil trees but i never realized so sadly they were ordinary beings like me we made love atop saturn s rings but she never opened her eyes we rode through the galaxies on the backs of comets but all she did was cry and we landed in her bedroom off 32nd and west and i ran my fingers once

stage with some slides and a few comments but the main stage is going to be with brian when he comes up and talks about how he built the airbnb culture so you are here you have been following the presentations so you know how to get started you have built a team you know how to build your product its off the ground it s growing people love it you figured out how to do that you figured out to create a special one of a kind company with monopoly powers thats big and the market you are chasing after is slightly bigger than the paper airplane business so you are good right so now what so we are here to submit that actually culture is the thing that is actually going to be very very important to scale the business as well as your team and hopefully after this talk you will be able to know what is culture why does it matter how do you create your core values and think about elements that fit together for core values and culture that create a high performance team get some best practices for the culture what is culture anybody want to take a guess at how one should define this yeah thats good did you look that up because you had a computer and an internet connection these are some definitions that you will find in websters dictionary but we are stanford this is kind of a trick question its a cs class the questions are never straight forward the real question is what is the company culture going to be culture we can generally talk about society about groups about places or things here we re talking about company culture so how does one define company culture we can take the previous definition and modify it a little bit this is a hint of how we may want to define company culture every day blank and blank of each member of the team in pursuit of our company blank some people have filled these in with different things the first blank a could be assumptions beliefs values now my favorite is core values the second blank for the b blank people said behavior my favorite is action how do you act in pursuit of goals thats kind of weak in pursuit of big and hairy audacious goals is a little stronger but a better definition is in the pursuit of mission so now that we have that definition what do we do with that and why does it matter this is a quote from gandhi your beliefs become your thoughts your thoughts become your words your words become your actions your actions become the habits your habits become your values and your values become your destiny if you don t have a good culture in the company you cant pursue your destiny why it matters is that it becomes the first principles you sort of go back to when you make decisions it becomes a way to align people on values that matter to the company it provides a certain level of stability to fall back on and it provides level of trust people sort of trust each other with but it also gives us a list with which you should be able to figure out what to do and what not to do and what the more important thing about that is what not to do then finally the other thing that is important is it allows you to retain the right employees there are people in this world that are not going to be a fit for your company but if you have good strong culture and the strong core values you ll know who you want to retain and who you truly do not want to retain and if you take the first letter of those it happens to help you move faster another reason you re thinking that s like all mushy stuff this is actually more scientific stuff so here are indices from 1994 to 2013 stock market indices of companies in the s p500 and the russell 3000 and the fortune 100 best companies to work for all these companies out there and they picked out companies that they believed were the best companies to work for the stock market returns of those companies happen to be 11 8 which is almost twice that of the other two indices and so there is real power in companies that treat their employees well where there s a lot of trust there is a lot of strong culture so how do you create a set of values and define the culture etc get asked that a lot you have to start with the leader of the company and the founder and ask yourself what are the values that are the most important to you of those things that are most important in the business who are the types of people you like working with and what are their values and through that you distill together what a set of values are think about all the people that you ve never liked working with what values do they have think of the opposite of that maybe those should be considered values for your company finally remember the values have to support your mission and if they don t support your mission youre missing something then the last final checks are they have to be creditable they have to be uniquely tied to match your mission so at zappos in terms of uniquely applied to the mission we were focused on creating a culture that was going to provide great customer service so the first core value we had was to deliver wow through service we are very specific that we wanted to deliver great customer service and it was going to be a wow experience and then below that we wanted to serve i had a paragraph talking about what we mean by that we wanted to support them doing the wow through service and support people such as our employees our customers our brand partners and investors on terms of the opposite thing we generally didnt like working with arrogant people so one of our core values at zappos was to be humble so those are two examples where we create core values in a way that became credible and uniquely tied to our mission so you go through this process you come up with a few core values these might be some of them whether it s honesty integrity service teamwork it might be a list you might start with three might end up with a list of ten you might have a list of thirty its a good start when zappos went through this process we asked all the employees at the time what core values they can identify with and they came up with thirty seven we whittled that down to about ten and it took a year to do this that s a long time and you might want to ask why well if you just come up with the word honesty give me a break everybody wants the culture to be honest nobody is going to say i want to be lied to every day service what do you mean by service theres got to be a lot more depth in this than that and everybody talks about teamwork but there s a difference in level of teamwork that you see in an intramural sports team vs a baseball team how do you dive deeper into teamwork what are the things that don t work for a team a lot of it has to do with communication a lot has to do with things that people of study and you may one go deeper into that at zappos we thought about well there are a lot of smart people in this room when they re fighting with each other and trying to figure out who s right and who s not its probably not the best use of time we wanted everyone to build off each other and help each other make any idea better the result is that the company gets a better idea not that any individual person is right so we wanted to make and still this idea that it s company first then your department then your the team then yourself and how do you do that we are going to go a level deeper in that there s another great element of high performing teams that i really like which is this pyramid that was created by patrick lencioni and he wrote this book the five dysfunctions of a team and the reason this is interesting is he talks about the breakdowns of the team a lot of teams break down because they have no trust and even if you had trust why do you need trust if you have trust you can actually have debates and conflict and get to the right answer if you don t have conflicts and debate it s the blind leading the blind how do you actually know you got to the right answer before you commit to something so people are not actually wanting to commit they re afraid of committing lets say you get to the next level when you are actually able to commit what goes wrong then it s usually because people are not held accountable to things that they committed to and if people are not held accountable to the things that they committed to then they cant get results if you think about the company as a black box and results whether it s financial whether you produce a great product or anything like that as the output one of the major inputs is the culture of the company some other best practices we are actually going to talk though in the q and a because i think they are going to blend into the conversation is that you want to incorporate your mission into your values we talked about that performance you need to think a bit harder deeper longer about your values than you might initially think you need to one of the things i think a lot of companies don t actually do is they interview for technical fit or skill fit a competency in that realm but they dont actually interview for the culture fit whether someone will actually believe in and follow the mission i think that is a big big no no i think you can have the smartest engineer in the world but if they don t believe the mission they are not going to pour their heart and soul into it and that s one of the things where if you actually start thinking about culture from the interview process to performance reviews to making sure thats a daily habit you get a lot further with making a great culture one final point made here culture just like customer service or fitness is like motherhood and apple pie everybody wants to provide great customer service every company wants to have great culture what they fail to do is make it a daily habit you just can t be fit if you don t do it as a daily habit eventually you get out of shape then you get fat and then you say oh i have to go on a crash diet to get back into shape that doesn t quite work and the same is true with something like culture so i think we checked all of these off so we can go into q and a with brian brian chesky hello everybody its quiet in here i ll be honest now i feel a little less on edge nothing worse than a room full of people really really quiet staring at you but now i feel better alfred lin well i did it for five or ten minutes you can do it a little longer so brian could you talk about the process by which you came to understand that culture was important to airbnb and building a company brian chesky yeah so i think one of the things we realized is to just give you i wont tell the full story of how airbnb came to be some of you may know it so heres the very short version the story airbnb wasn t meant to be the company we were trying to start i quit my job i was living in la one day i drove to san francisco became roommates with my friend from college from the rhode island school of design joe gebbia and i had one thousand dollars in the bank and the rent was one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars so that weekend this international design convention was coming to san francisco all the hotels were sold out so we decided to turn the house into a bed and breakfast for the conference i didnt have a bed joe had three air beds we pulled them out of the closet and called it the air bed and breakfast that s how the company started i recall the story ten thousand times by the way some version of that story and i didn t think i d ever tell that a second time i remember growing up i also went to college my parents were social workers and never thought about me going to art school they had worried that maybe i would not get a job after college which im sure most parents worry about make sure you promise me you get a job with health insurance i end up starting airbnb i remember her telling me i guess you never got the job with health insurance the reason i say this though is airbnb was never meant to be the big idea it was meant to be the thing to pay the rent so we could think of the big idea along the way by solving our problem it became the big idea so alongside that we wont touch on how we built a product that s probably another conversation that s being talked about you have to build a team and a great company and in the early days we had three co founders joe nate and myself i think of one of the reasons we re successful was that i was really lucky i don t think it was really lucky to pick up the idea airbnb and i dont think we were lucky to be successful once we had a team i think we could have come up with a lot of other ideas and been just as successful i think i was lucky in that i found two great people that i wanted to start up a business with people i admired that almost intimidated me by how smart they were i think that s what the first thing is to build a team that is so talented that they kind of slightly make you uncomfortable to be with them because you know you are going to have to raise your game to be with them and then when we were working together in the early days this is 2008 the first thing is we were like a family you think about founders like parents and the company like a child that child will manifest in many ways behaviors that parents have in the relationship if the parents are functional but not working together then the child is frankly going to be pretty fucked up you dont want that you want your culture to be awesome and so joe nate and i were a total family the beginning we usually worked eighteen hours a day seven days a week i remember when we were at y combinator we worked together we ate food together or even went to the gym together we may as well have gotten jumpsuit we didnt go that far it was like we were a mission a special force we had this amazing shared way of doing things with amazing accountability and that was the dna of a company and then we were thinking at some point you build the product to phase two which is building the company that builds the product so a lot of the talk is about how to build a product how to get product market fit once people do that now you have to build a company it doesn t matter how great your original product idea is if you cannot build a great company then your product will not endure as we thought about this we realized we wanted to build a company for the long term we wanted a company that would endure to do that we started noticing companies have something in common companies around for a really long time had a clear mission a clear sense of values and they had a shared way of doing something that was unique to them and was really special and so joe nate and i when we were three people decided to look around at companies i noticed apple steve jobs core value was that he believed people with passion could change the world he said our products change but our value never has we learned about amazon we learned about nike we learned about companies in the early days you can even use this to talk about nations even a nation has core values and a declaration so that the nation may endure longer we started to realize that we needed to have intention culture needs to be designed and that is how we got connected because we were funded by sequoia alfred just joined them with zappos and i was told zappos had an amazing culture we went to las vegas and met up with tony and we learned about it alfred lin so what did you learn brian chesky well you guys are crazy the thing we learned and we were three people was if culture is a way of doing things there really are two arts one is behaviors and those can change maybe fifty years from now there will be rituals and behaviors that change be different but there have to be some things that never change some principles some ideas that endure that make you you and i think of core values integrity honesty those arent core values those are values that everyone should have but there have to be like three five six things that are unique to you and you can probably think about this in your life what is different about you that every single other person if you could only tell them three or four things you would want them to know about you and we realized that when zappos was one hundred employees they wrote down these ten core values the thing i learned from tony is i wish i didnt wait until i was one hundred employees to write down a core value i was talking to sam he thinks we are the only company to write our core values down before we hired anyone alfred lin how long did it take you to hire your first employee brian chesky so the first employee was our first engineer i think we looked for him for four or five months i probably looked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people alfred lin by then when you hired him when did you write it was it on day one or two or was it three brian chesky i think we started working on it around the time of y combinator which would ve been january 2009 it was probably a process that evolved over the course of six to seven months we finished y combinator in april 2009 hired our first engineer in july something like that probably six months some people ask why did you spend so much time on hiring your first engineer i think bringing in your first engineer is like bringing in a dna chip to the company this person if we re successful there were going to be a thousand people just like him or her in that company it still wasn t a matter of getting somebody to build the next three features we need the ship for users there was something much more long term and much more enduring which was do i want to work with one hundred thousand more people like this now you want diversity to play you want diversity of background age you don t want diversity of values you want very homogenous beliefs thats the one thing that shouldnt be diverse alfred lin so what were these values brian chesky six core values ill talk about maybe three of them so the first core value we talk about is champion in mission and what it really means is that we want to hire people that are here for a mission we dont want people here because they think we have a great valuation they like our office design they need a job or they think its hot we want people to be here for the one thing that will never change and thats our mission and just to tell you a quick story about our mission airbnb a lot of people describe it as a way to book a room or book a house and travel around the world and thats what we do but that is not why we do it to answer the question on what our mission is is to tell you a story i think it describes it in 2012 i met a host named sebastian we do these new jobs around the world where we do meet ups sebastian is probably late fifties in north london sebastian looks at me and says brian there is this word you never use on your website and i say what s that word and he says that word is friendship i would love to read a story about friendship i said okay read me a story about friendship he says six months ago the brunt of riots broke out in front of my home and i was very scared the next day my mom called me to make sure i was ok i said yeah mom im ok and she goes what about the house he says the house is ok as well he said here s the interesting thing from the time the riots broke out to the time my mom called me was a twenty four hour window of time in the periods between that time seven of my previous airbnb guests called me just to make sure i was okay he said think about that seven of my own guests called me before my own mother did i think that says more about his mother than his guests but in this summer on a typical night or a peak night we wouldhave four hundred twenty five thousand people staying in homes and living together and they were coming from a hundred and ninety different countries in the world which is every country except north korea iran syria cuba so just hearing that story at our core that is what we are about thats much more than just booking a room or traveling that what we are about is we want to help bring the world together we want to do that by giving a sense of belonging anywhere you go our mission is to belong anywhere so five years from now twenty years from now maybe we re still selling rooms and homes to meet in or not but i can guarantee you we re always going be about a sense of belonging and bringing people together and that s the more enduring idea so when we hire people the first thing to make sure it is that if that is your mission you need to champion your mission you champion the mission by living the mission do you believe in it do you have stories about it do you use the product do you believe in the product i used to ask crazy questions one of the crazy questions sam reminds me of i use to interview people so i interviewed the first three hundred employees at airbnb which people think im really neurotic and they may also be true i used to ask them a question if you had a year left to live would you take this job i amended it people who say yes probably don t like their families so i changed it to ten years i feel like you should use whatever time you have left to live whatever you want to do in those last ten years you should just do i really want you to think about that that was enough time for you to do something you really cared about and the answer doesn t have to be this company i say fine if what youre meant to do is travel or start a company just do that don t come here go do that so there is this old parable about two men laying bricks somebody comes up to the first man and says what are you doing im building a wall he asks the other guy he says im building a cathedral there s a job and there is a calling we want to hire people not only looking for jobs but a calling and that s the first value champion the mission i dont want to take all the time i will talk about just one more the second value relates to being frugal and i will tell you a story by the way all the founding stories of your company end up becoming the things that you keep talking about to thousands of people kind of like a child that these things keep coming back later in life so airbnb i think marc andreessen said in the last talk that it was the worst idea that ever worked i remember people thinking we were crazy i remember telling people about the idea i actually told paul graham i said we have this idea its called airbnb he asked people are actually doing this i said yeah question was what s wrong with them so i knew the interview wasn t going well and in the interview paul graham i think wasn t going to accept us and we told the story of how we funded the company and here s how it goes we re introduced michael seibel who is a partner of y combinator introduced me and joe to like fifteen investors in the valley including some of the ones that have been here and all of them said no to the company they could have bought ten percent of the company for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars they all said no they thought it was crazy no one would ever stay in someone s home so we ended up funding the company with credit cards and you know those binders kids in school put baseball cards in we had to put them in those we had to put them somewhere thats how many credit cards we had and we were completely in debt and in the fall of 2008 we provided housing for the democratic and republican national convention we had this crazy idea because we weren t selling a lot of homes in the year after we launched we had a hundred people a day visiting our website and two bookings which is generally bad its like releasing a song and a year later three people are listing to it a day its probably not going to be a very popular song but i believed in it joe and nate believed in it so we are completely in debt right and we get this idea we are an air bed and breakfast providing housing for the democratic republican national convention what if we made a breakfast cereal for like the democratic national convention and we came up with this obama themed cereal and we called it obama os the breakfast of change then we came up with a republican themed cereal for john mccain we found out he was a captain in the navy so we came up with captain mccains a maverick in every bite we had zero dollars and without any money we tried calling general mills they told us to stop calling them or they would get a restraining order so that didn t work we found a local though an alumni of risd who made a thousand boxes deal for us we ended up sending them to press and eventually within a week it got on national television national news we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal in 2008 we made five thousand dollars from our website and we made forty thousand dollars selling breakfast cereal i remember my mom asking so are a you cereal company now and that wasn t that bad part the bad part was the honest answer which was technically yes but the reason i tell that is our second core value is to be a cereal entrepreneur i m sorry for the cheesy pun but be a cereal entrepreneur we really mean is that we believe constraints bring out the creativity when you raise eight hundred million dollars suddenly all that scrappiness it s easy to lose that scrappiness its easier for people to tell you i just need this fifty thousand dollar contract i need this i need that when people are desperate and not being a little bit frugal not being creative or tell me they can t do something i ll just take a box of cereal and even the suggestion of obama os is you need to be scrappy and frugal so again a lot of the founding dna of your company becomes these values these principles everyone knows that if you don t give a crap you shouldn t be here and it doesn t mean you have to give a crap it just means you have to to be here you also have to be creative to be an entrepreneur and super scrappy and these are some of the values we learned alfred lin so you guys should start to think about questions when we open up to questions from the audience but i have a few more questions to ask so this all sounds nice stories are great the people here are a pretty skeptical group its a cs department class probably left brain focused this feels like a softie right brain focus how does having a strong culture help you make important tough decisions brian chesky well i think that having it so here s the thing about culture there are three things they never tell you about culture first thing is they never tell you anything about culture no one talks about culture and no one ever tells the need to have strong culture so there s tons of articles about building a great product there s tons of articles on growth and adaption and a few things about culture its a mystical thing that s soft and fuzzy that s the first problem the second problem is it is hard to measure things that are hard to measure often get discounted these are two very hard things the third thing the biggest problem it doesn t pay off in the short term if you wanted to start up a company and sell it in one year the one thing i would tell you to do is fuck up the culture just hire people quickly culture makes you hire really slowly makes you deliberate about your decisions that in the near term can slow progress putting an investment into the company short term first thing is the need to be very clear about what s unique to you that you stand for once you do that you need to hire people that believe in that you need to make sure you hire and fire based on these values one thing we do is constantly repeat over and over again when we interview we want to make sure they are world class and fit the culture the first thing i used to ask people at the end of the interview i would say if you can hire this is a functional question if you could hire anybody in the world would you hire the person sitting across from you if our vision is the best in the world why arent we hiring the best in the world every single person is meant to hire a person better than the previous people you are constantly raising the bar then we have separate people called core values interviewers who arent in the function so it you are an engineer the core values interviewers are never engineers because we don t want them to be biased and say well i know how good they are and they interview just for values to make sure that people care about the same thing and we said no to a lot of really great people because we just didn t feel right about them being with us long term so that s one of the things some other examples of when we have had to make hard decisions in mid 2011 we were mostly united states and we had this internet clone funded by these guys called the samwer brothers anyone ever hear of them they basically clone internet companies they recently went public they take american websites and clone them and then quickly try to sell them back to you its kind of like putting a gun to your head so they had done this to groupon groupon was the fastest growing site in the world ever they stopped doing groupon and started cloning us and this is back when we had forty employees we had raised seven million dollars they cloned us and in thirty days they hired four hundred people and they wanted to sell the company and if they couldnt they were going to destroy us around the world the problem with airbnb is if we are not everywhere around the world a travel site not being in europe is like your phone not having email it doesn t actually work so we were kind of in trouble we had this conversation it was a pragmatic decision of should we acquire them and then there was the values decision the pragmatic one probably said buy them because you can t risk losing international so just guarantee you are going to get international we ended up not buying them the reason we ended up not buying them was i just didn t like the culture i didnt want to bring in those four hundred people i felt like we were missionaries and they were mercenaries i didn t feel like they were doing it for the beliefs i thought they were doing it to make a lot of money very quickly i believed in a war missionaries would outlast and endure mercenaries i also felt like the best revenge against an internet clone was just to make them run the company long term you had the baby now you ve got to raise it so that s what we ended up doing and that was a very controversial decision a lot of people were telling me you should buy this company we didn t and i think it worked out alfred lin what percentage of revenue comes from europe brian chesky more than fifty percent alfred lin i think it worked out okay anybody have any questions i can keep going no one one statement we had at zappos is culture and brand were two sides of the same coin airbnb has a great culture and a great brand do you care to talk about branding its kind of a weak thing it s a value we don t tend to focus on brian chesky i actually just said that to sam i think silicon valley is not historically really strong or we don t talk about culture and brand very much they are two sides of the same coin so culture like the principles and the beliefs you have inside a company that you want people to be aligned with long term whatever happens inside the company eventually comes out you cant hold it in and brand is really the promise outside the company that everyone identifies with so i think having a clear mission and making sure that you know that mission and the mission comes through the company is probably the best thing you can do for both culture and values and then the second thing you know is that your brand the way people think about you and your company is often decided by your brand evangelists who are your employees if you have a weak culture we often think that companies that hire employees people that are deeply passionate create companies that customers are really passion about those are companies with strong brands and so zappos had a really strong brand a lot of companies google that cared deeply about culture they actually have a question is this person google which is meant to be like the catch all for the digital culture it was a very strong culture google has a unique there s no such thing as a good or bad culture its either a strong or weak culture and a good culture for someone else may not be a good culture for you so i think brand is incredibly important as well brand is really the connection of you with your customers and so if you have an incredibly strong culture the brand will come through the final thing to say about brand is a lot of people that talk about their brand talk about what they sell so if youre apple one way of doing the same we sell computers and the new screens are larger and faster and they talk about bits and bytes i remember steve jobs had this really important talk where he says the way to win this is 1997 isn t to talk about bits and bytes the way to win is talk about what we value what our core values are we believe passionate people can change the world and that was how they introduced a different campaign so apple before they had this huge renaissance became the most valuable company in the world they did the think different campaign which is basically saying this is what we believe in that if you buy an apple computer you re also saying i believe in this too and there has to be a deeper core belief and if that doesnt happen youre a utility and utilities get sold at commodity prices alfred lin the question is how do you know how to communicate this company culture or core value to the outside world brian chesky so the question is how do you communicate what airbnb does in the earlier days well we learned a lot because in the early days we communicated like a utility we actually said airbnb is a cheap affordable alternative to hotels our tag line was forget hotels save money with airbnb and over time we felt like that was this was way back in the day we felt like that was way too limiting that it undercut the idea we changed our tag line to travel like a human which we havent kept but it was basically meant to say that we believe in a certain kind of world and we really feel like travel is mass produced you feel isolated you feel like a stranger and we want to bring the world back to the place where it feels like a village again where the service is coming from other people where you have this feeling you belong and you are treated like a human no matter how successful you are in life often traveling will remind you that you are not that successful go through tsa stay in a typical hotel sometimes you ll have some problems we really wanted to make people feel special this is some of the stuff we did in the early days we did a lot of storytelling i mean i ve probably told the story of airbnb ten thousand times and this is a something that is kind of related to culture someone asked me the other day whats the job of the ceo there are lots of things a ceo does but what you mostly do is articulate the vision to articulate a vision you have to develop a strategy and hire people that fit the culture if you do those three things you basically have a company and that company will hopefully be successful if you have the right vision a good strategy and the people to get there and so what you end up doing is articulating the vision over and over whether its recruiting talking to investors getting funding doing pr interviews speaking in a class room you are always reinforcing the values youre doing it in an email to a customer you just do it a thousand times it changes and gets better and better every time so it kind of evolved very good question how do we make sure the hosts are reinforcing the culture of airbnb so the answer to that is we do a pretty good job but not yet an amazing job at that when we first founded airbnb i took the craig newmark school of thought craig is the founder of craigslist anyone should be able to use airbnb if you want to rent your place you should be able to it turns out many people believe in our values because we talked about them and believed them but there were people who rented on airbnb not because they believed in the values but instead because they realized they could make a lot of money renting their home and not everyone was a great culture fit these people actually did cause us a lot of problems so this was a lesson for me i didn t think it didnt occur to me in the early days that the hosts had to completely fit our values we met them we attract people like us we realized hosts are like partners and they need to believe in the same culture we do so now we have this program called the super host program where they have to demonstrate values to reach this kind of badge which gets the priority customer support and distribution we are having this important host convention where we bring all the hosts in and will be talking about reinforcing our values so the answer is we were really late but we now do it by reinforcing it every step of the way q brian airbnb has made some great contributions to the open source community do you have any thoughts on how that contributes to your culture and company values brian chesky yeah i think just in general it may be related to two things about airbnb we tend to be a pretty open culture just in general we believe in a shared world where people are giving back contributing to making communities and industries stronger its my philosophy to talk about everything internally except for things that relate to customer or client privacy if it doesnt relate to those two things then we will talk about it as far as open source culture and engineering we wanted to make sure that we had a really strong identification of the team and so we really felt like a lot of source code shouldn t be you know we felt like every company needs some kind of moat that protects you from your competition we thought some technology would be but we also felt like we wanted to give back from a technology standpoint we preferred our moat to be that we provide the very best experience in the world when you use airbnb that has the biggest network effects we thought that kind of took precedent over some of the technology that we use so we decided to try to share some of that out to people i think it does relate to the values i never recommended i never one day recommended we do any of that we hired engineers that we thought shared our values in culture and they felt that was the right thing to do q you talk about conventions what did you do when you had no money and you only got paid for those who used your site what did you do to scale that up how did you get users to the site brian chesky so this is not about culture but i will answer it anyway the best advice i ever got was probably from paul graham paul graham said i remember he had this line it s better to have a hundred people that love you than to have a million people that just sort of like you it s literally better to have a hundred people love you and the reason why if you have one million customers one million users and they just kind of don t care about you but they use your app and think you re okay to get them to care is a really hard thing i dont know how to get a million people to all of a sudden care but i do know if you get a hundred people who love you those people if they feel incredibly passionate they will go out and eacb tell a hundred people all movements that lead to companies or ideas start with just a hundred people so the reason this is so critical is he gave us another lesson which is that if all you need do is get a hundred people to love you is do things that dont scale so it s hard if you ve got a million people you can t you meet them all you can meet a hundred people you can spend time with them so that s exactly what we did joe nate and i would go door to door in new york city or in denver where the democratic national convention was literally staying and living with our users it s a joke that when you buy an iphone steve jobs does not come sleep on your couch but i will that was really critical living with our users all we had to do was get in with them and share a passion with our users you work backwards from a hundred people even one person but with our new technology imagine what would be an amazing experience for just this one person walk through the journey from that one person make it perfect for that one person once you make it perfect for one person it s actually really easy to make a service easy for one person its not that hard where everyone gets in trouble is they try to solve both at the same time so the first thing we did was went door to door that is one thing that set up memories i will give one more example before i stop talking about this right now with airbnb you can click a button and put in your home and a professional photographer comes to your home and photographs it for free we have five thousand photographers around the world and we have photographed hundreds of thousands of homes so it is the probably one of the largest on demand photography groups around i believe this started with joe and i we were staying with this one host in new york city and her house is amazing but her photos were terrible so we asked why you dont put up better photos this is before the life of the great cameras 2008 she couldnt figure out how to get photos from her phone onto her computer she wasnt a very technically savvy woman and i just said we will just take photos for you actually i said what if you could press a button and somebody would show up at your door to take professional photographs she said that would be magic so the next day i knock on her door going im here i photographed her home i sent a few emails to people saying we give this new magical photography service and if you want you can press the button for a professional photographer to show up at your home so they would hit this button and it would send me this alert we rented a camera in brooklyn and in january 2009 walking through the snow we photographed peoples homes we did this by hand without any technology we managed that with spreadsheets i wasnt going to bother nate to design something for photography then we started hiring contract photographers eventfully we got an intern to manage all the contract photographers then we made a full time position to manage the other interns of the contract employees and at some point this is before we built anything at some point there were too many people to manage there were like hundreds of photographers then we built all the tools to do all the photography but we did it only after we knew what the perfect service was q one more question the question is in this particular situation with airbnb a lot of people think it is not necessarily a technology company but more of a marketing company brian chesky good question i will answer the question with a story alfred lin let me preface that question with a series of questions do you today have propriety technology brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a moat brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have network effects brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have pricing power brian chesky yes alfred lin do you have a good brand brian chesky i think so alfred lin are you a monopoly brian chesky i am not going to answer that one alfred lin getting back to the question just forgetting about all of that companies that have network effects and sort of get off the ground the fly wheel is going people just think you are lucky brian chesky let me just answer that one its a totally fair question and people have said it so i want to answer it the guy who owns sequoia capital his name is doug leone one day i think it was a year year and half ago he says your job sucks and i was all what the hell does that mean he says you have the worst job of any ceo in my portfolio i said tell me why and this is what he said first of all you are a technology company and i would say that at our heart we are a technology company so you have all the challenges of all the other portfolio companies but beyond that you are in a hundred and ninety different countries so you have to figure out how to be international you have to hire in every country in the world we are literally in every country except north korea iran syria and cuba we are a payments company we handle billions of dollars of transactions a year we had to get a business license in the state of california we have serious fraud and risk it needs to be locked down like fort knox he said thats usually where companies end but you have to worry about all the other crap trust and safety we have four hundred and twenty five thousand people staying in other people s individual beds in their sheets think about a woman from texas staying in the middle east or vice versa think about the cultural conflicts that could happen and misunderstandings you have four hundred and twenty five thousand people a night its like being the mayor of oakland so imagine you are the mayor of oakland and all the things that happened in oakland tonight you have trust and safety now we have regulatory problems we are in thirty thousand different cities every city has different rules different laws and many were written in a different century they were written before you had all the technology then you have issues like search and discovery google has this thing about being really good at search google can give me all these results but its clear that there is only one or two right answers for everybody we have forty thousand homes in paris there is no best home in paris for anyone in this room so we have to be really really great at matching people and technology another example facebook is a digital product their product is their website our product is these experiences that you have in the real world we are not just an online product but also an offline product so basically the long and the short of it is we have to be world class at technology world class at design we have to be world class at branding we have to convince government we are good for their neighborhood because we have to convince people that we are not crazy this is a real thing we have to make sure trust and safety is world class we handle all these payments and handle risk and i didnt even mention culture this was not about culture i really do not see it as a marketing company
