and crowds dangle me from their thighs widening across where life is here cause my love is crying i ll share the way i ve lost cause i m a pretend me and i m real cause i can hit me softly and bleed

to ascertain how far by fitting to metrical arrangement a selection of the real language of men in a state of vivid sensation that sort of pleasure and that quantity of pleasure may be imparted which a poet may rationally endeavour to impart i had formed no very inaccurate estimate of the probable effect of those poems i flattered myself that they who should be pleased with them would read them with more than common pleasure and on the other hand i was well aware that by those who should dislike them they would be read with more than common dislike the result has differed from my expectation in this only that i have pleased a greater number than i ventured to hope i should please xxx for the sake of variety and from a consciousness of my own weakness i was induced to request the assistance of a friend who furnished me with the poems of the ancient mariner the foster mother s tale the nightingale and the poem entitled love i should not however have requested this assistance had i not believed that the poems of my friend would in a great measure have the same tendency as my own and that though there would be found a difference there would be found no discordance in the colours of our style as our opinions on the subject of poetry do almost entirely coincide several of my friends are anxious for the success of these poems from a belief that if the views with which they were composed were indeed realized a class of poetry would be produced well adapted to interest mankind permanently and not unimportant in the multiplicity and in the quality of its moral relations and on this account they have advised me to prefix a systematic defence of the theory upon which the poems were written but i was unwilling to undertake the task because i knew that on this occasion the reader would look coldly upon my arguments since i might be suspected of having been principally influenced by the selfish and foolish hope of reasoning him into an approbation of these particular poems and i was still more unwilling to undertake the task because adequately to display my opinions and fully to enforce my arguments would require a space wholly disproportionate to the nature of a preface for to treat the subject with the clearness and coherence of which i believe it susceptible it would be necessary to give a full account of the present state of the public taste in this country and to determine how far this taste is healthy or depraved which again could not be determined without pointing out in what manner language and the human mind act and re act on each other and without retracing the revolutions not of literature alone but likewise of society itself i have therefore altogether declined to enter regularly upon this defence yet i am sensible that there would be some impropriety in abruptly obtruding upon the public without a few words of introduction poems so materially different from those upon which general approbation is at present bestowed it is supposed that by the act of writing in verse an author makes a formal engagement that he will gratify certain known habits of association that he not only thus apprizes the reader that certain classes of ideas and expressions will be found in his book but that others will be carefully excluded this exponent or symbol held forth by metrical language must in different eras of literature have excited very different expectations for example in the age of catullus terence and lucretius and that of statius or claudian and in our own country in the age of shakespeare and beaumont and fletcher and that of donne and cowley or dryden or pope i will not take upon me to determine the exact import of the promise which by the act of writing in verse an author in the present day makes to his reader but i am certain it will appear to many persons that i have not fulfilled the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted they who have been accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modern writers if they persist in reading this book to its conclusion will no doubt frequently have to struggle with feelings of strangeness and aukwardness they will look round for poetry and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume that title i hope therefore the reader will not censure me if i attempt to state what i have proposed to myself to perform and also to explain some of the chief reasons which have determined me in the choice of my purpose that at least he may be spared any unpleasant feeling of disappointment and that i myself may be protected from the most dishonorable accusation which can be brought against an author namely that of an indolence which prevents him from endeavouring to ascertain what is his duty or when his duty is ascertained prevents him from performing it the principal object then which i proposed to myself in these poems was to chuse incidents and situations from common life and to relate or describe them throughout as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men and at the same time to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual way and further and above all to make these incidents and situations interesting by tracing in them truly though not ostentatiously the primary laws of our nature chiefly as far as regards the manner in which we associate ideas in a state of excitement low and rustic life was generally chosen because in that condition the essential passions of the heart find a better soil in which they can attain their maturity are less under restraint and speak a plainer and more emphatic language because in that condition of life our elementary feelings co exist in a state of greater simplicity and consequently may be more accurately contemplated and more forcibly communicated because the manners of rural life germinate from those elementary feelings and from the necessary character of rural occupations are more easily comprehended and are more durable and lastly because in that condition the passions of men are incorporated with the beautiful and permanent forms of nature the language too of these men is adopted because such men hourly communicate with the best objects from which the best part of language is originally derived and because from their rank in society and the sameness and narrow circle of their intercourse being less under the influence of social vanity they convey their feelings and notions in simple and unelaborated expressions accordingly such a language arising out of repeated experience and regular feelings is a more permanent and a far more philosophical language than that which is frequently substituted for it by poets who think that they are conferring honour upon themselves and their art in proportion as they separate themselves from the sympathies of men and indulge in arbitrary and capricious habits of expression in order to furnish food for fickle tastes and fickle appetites of their own creation i cannot however be insensible of the present outcry against the triviality and meanness both of thought and language which some of my contemporaries have occasionally introduced into their metrical compositions and i acknowledge that this defect where it exists is more dishonorable to the writer s own character than false refinement or arbitrary innovation though i should contend at the same time that it is far less pernicious in the sum of its consequences from such verses the poems in these volumes will be found distinguished at least by one mark of difference that each of them bas a worthy purpose not that i mean to say that i always began to write with a distinct purpose formally conceived but i believe that my habits of meditation have so formed my feelings as that my descriptions of such objects as strongly excite those feelings will be found to carry along with them a purpose if in this opinion i am mistaken i can have little right to the name of a poet for all good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings but though this be true poems to which any value can be attached were never produced on any variety of subjects but by a man who being possessed of more than usual organic sensibility had also thought long and deeply for our continued influxes of feeling are modified and directed by our thoughts which are indeed the representatives of all our past feelings and as by contemplating the relation of these general representatives to each other we discover what is really important to men so by the repetition and continuance of this act our feelings will be connected with important subjects till at length if we be originally possessed of much sensibility such habits of mind will be produced that by obeying blindly and mechanically the impulses of those habits we shall describe objects and utter sentiments of such a nature and in such connection with each other that the understanding of the being to whom we address ourselves if he be in a healthful state of association must necessarily be in some degree enlightened and his affections ameliorated i have said that each of these poems has a purpose i have also informed my reader what this purpose will be found principally to be namely to illustrate the manner in which our feelings and ideas are associated in a state of excitement but speaking in language somewhat more appropriate it is to follow the fluxes and refluxes of the mind when agitated by the great and simple affections of our nature this object i have endeavoured in these short essays to attain by various means by tracing the maternal passion through many of its more subtle windings as in the poems of the idiot boy and the mad mother by accompanying the last struggles of a human being at the approach of death cleaving in solitude to life and society as in the poem of the forsaken indian by shewing as in the stanzas entitled we are seven the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death or rather our utter inability to admit that notion or by displaying the strength of fraternal or to speak more philosophically of moral attachment when early associated with the great and beautiful objects of nature as in the brothers or as in the incident of simon lee by placing my reader in the way of receiving from ordinary moral sensations another and more salutary impression than we are accustomed to receive from them it has also been part of my general purpose to attempt to sketch characters under the influence of less impassioned feelings as in the two april mornings the fountain the old man travelling the two thieves c characters of which the elements are simple belonging rather to nature than to manners such as exist now and will probably always exist and which from their constitution may be distinctly and profitably contemplated i will not abuse the indulgence of my reader by dwelling longer upon this subject but it is proper that i should mention one other circumstance which distinguishes these poems from the popular poetry of the day it is this that the feeling therein developed gives importance to the action and situation and not the action and situation to the feeling my meaning will be rendered perfectly intelligible by referring my reader to the poems entitled poor susan and the childless father particularly to the last stanza of the latter poem i will not suffer a sense of false modesty to prevent me from asserting that i point my reader s attention to this mark of distinction far less for the sake of these particular poems than from the general importance of the subject the subject is indeed important for the human mind is capable of being excited without the application of gross and violent stimulants and he must have a very faint perception of its beauty and dignity who does not know this and who does not further know that one being is elevated above another in proportion as he possesses this capability it has therefore appeared to me that to endeavour to produce or enlarge this capability is one of the best services in which at any period a writer can be engaged but this service excellent at all times is especially so at the present day for a multitude of causes unknown to former times are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor the most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daily taking place and the encreasing accumulation of men in cities where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident which the rapid communication of intelligence hourly gratifies to this tendency of life and manners the literature and theatrical exhibitions of the country have conformed themselves the invaluable works of our elder writers i had almost said the works of shakespeare and milton are driven into neglect by frantic novels sickly and stupid german tragedies and deluges of idle and extravagant stories in verse when i think upon this degrading thirst after outrageous stimulation i am almost ashamed to have spoken of the feeble effort with which i have endeavoured to counteract it and reflecting upon the magnitude of the general evil i should be oppressed with no dishonorable melancholy had i not a deep impression of certain inherent and indestructible qualities of the human mind and likewise of certain powers in the great and permanent objects that act upon it which are equally inherent and indestructible and did i not further add to this impression a belief that the time is approaching when the evil will be systematically opposed by men of greater powers and with far more distinguished success having dwelt thus long on the subjects and aim of these poems i shall request the reader s permission to apprize him of a few circumstances relating to their style in order among other reasons that i may not be censured for not having performed what i never attempted the reader will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur in these volumes and i hope are utterly rejected as an ordinary device to elevate the style and raise it above prose i have proposed to myself to imitate and as far as is possible to adopt the very language of men and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular part of that language they are indeed a figure of speech occasionally prompted by passion and i have made use of them as such but i have endeavoured utterly to reject them as a mechanical device of style or as a family language which writers in metre seem to lay claim to by prescription i have wished to keep my reader in the company of flesh and blood persuaded that by so doing i shall interest him i am however well aware that others who pursue a different track may interest him likewise i do not interfere with their claim i only wish to prefer a different claim of my own there will also be found in these volumes little of what is usually called poetic diction i have taken as much pains to avoid it as others ordinarily take to produce it this i have done for the reason already alleged to bring my language near to the language of men and further because the pleasure which i have proposed to myself to impart is of a kind very different from that which is supposed by many persons to be the proper object of poetry i do not know how without being culpably particular i can give my reader a more exact notion of the style in which i wished these poems to be written than by informing him that i have at all times endeavoured to look steadily at my subject consequently i hope that there is in these poems little falsehood of description and that my ideas are expressed in language fitted to their respective importance something i must have gained by this practice as it is friendly to one property of all good poetry namely good sense but it has necessarily cut me off from a large portion of phrases and figures of speech which from father to son have long been regarded as the common inheritance of poets i have also thought it expedient to restrict myself still further having abstained from the use of many expressions in themselves proper and beautiful but which have been foolishly repeated by bad poets till such feelings of disgust are connected with them as it is scarcely possible by any art of association to overpower if in a poem there should be found a series of lines or even a single line in which the language though naturally arranged and according to the strict laws of metre does not differ from that of prose there is a numerous class of critics who when they stumble upon these prosaisms as they call them imagine that they have made a notable discovery and exult over the poet as over a man ignorant of his own profession now these men would establish a canon of criticism which the reader will conclude he must utterly reject if he wishes to be pleased with these volumes and it would be a most easy task to prove to him that not only the language of a large portion of every good poem even of the most elevated character must necessarily except with reference to the metre in no respect differ from that of good prose but likewise that some of the most interesting parts of the best poems will be found to be strictly the language of prose when prose is well written the truth of this assertion might be demonstrated by innumerable passages from almost all the poetical writings even of milton himself i have not space for much quotation but to illustrate the subject in a general manner i will here adduce a short composition of gray who was at the head of those who by their reasonings have attempted to widen the space of separation betwixt prose and metrical composition and was more than any other man curiously elaborate in the structure of his own poetic diction in vain to me the smiling mornings shine and reddening phoebus lifts his golden fire the birds in vain their amorous descant join these ears alas for other notes repine a different object do these eyes require my lonely anguish melts no heart but mine and in my breast the imperfect joys expire yet morning smiles the busy race to cheer and new born pleasure brings to happier men the fields to all their wonted tribute bear to warm their little loves the birds complain i fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear and weep the more because i weep in vain it will easily be perceived that the only part of this sonnet which is of any value is the lines printed in italics it is equally obvious that except in the rhyme and in the use of the single word fruitless for fruitlessly which is so far a defect the language of these lines does in no respect differ from that of prose by the foregoing quotation i have shewn that the language of prose may yet be well adapted to poetry and i have previously asserted that a large portion of the language of every good poem can in no respect differ from that of good prose i will go further i do not doubt that it may be safely affirmed that there neither is nor can be any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition we are fond of tracing the resemblance between poetry and painting and accordingly we call them sisters but where shall we find bonds of connection sufficiently strict to typify the affinity betwixt metrical and prose composition they both speak by and to the same organs the bodies in which both of them are clothed may be said to be of the same substance their affections are kindred and almost identical not necessarily differing even in degree poetry sheds no tears such as angels weep but natural and human tears she can boast of no celestial ichor that distinguishes her vital juices from those of prose the same human blood circulates through the veins of them both if it be affirmed that rhyme and metrical arrangement of themselves constitute a distinction which overturns what i have been saying on the strict affinity of metrical language with that of prose and paves the way for other artificial distinctions which the mind voluntarily admits i answer that the language of such poetry as i am recommending is as far as is possible a selection of the language really spoken by men that this selection wherever it is made with true taste and feeling will of itself form a distinction far greater than would at first be imagined and will entirely separate the composition from the vulgarity and meanness of ordinary life and if metre be superadded thereto i believe that a dissimilitude will be produced altogether sufficient for the gratification of a rational mind what other distinction would we have whence is it to come and where is it to exist not surely where the poet speaks through the mouths of his characters it cannot be necessary here either for elevation of style or any of its supposed ornaments for if the poet s subject be judiciously chosen it will naturally and upon fit occasion lead him to passions the language of which if selected truly and judiciously must necessarily be dignified and variegated and alive with metaphors and figures i forbear to speak of an incongruity which would shock the intelligent reader should the poet interweave any foreign splendour of his own with that which the passion naturally suggests it is sufficient to say that such addition is unnecessary and surely it is more probable that those passages which with propriety abound with metaphors and figures will have their due effect if upon other occasions where the passions are of a milder character the style also be subdued and temperate but as the pleasure which i hope to give by the poems i now present to the reader must depend entirely on just notions upon this subject and as it is in itself of the highest importance to our taste and moral feelings i cannot content myself with these detached remarks and if in what i am about to say it shall appear to some that my labour is unnecessary and that i am like a man fighting a battle without enemies i would remind such persons that whatever may be the language outwardly holden by men a practical faith in the opinions which i am wishing to establish is almost unknown if my conclusions are admitted and carried as far as they must be carried if admitted at all our judgments concerning the works of the greatest poets both ancient and modern will be far different from what they are at present both when we praise and when we censure and our moral feelings influencing and influenced by these judgments will i believe be corrected and purified taking up the subject then upon general grounds i ask what is meant by the word poet what is a poet to whom does he address himself and what language is to be expected from him he is a man speaking to men a man it is true endued with more lively sensibility more enthusiasm and tenderness who has a greater knowledge of human nature and a more comprehensive soul than are supposed to be common among mankind a man pleased with his own passions and volitions and who rejoices more than other men in the spirit of life that is in him delighting to contemplate similar volitions and passions as manifested in the goings on of the universe and habitually impelled to create them where he does not find them to these qualities he has added a disposition to be affected more than other men by absent things as if they were present an ability of conjuring up in himself passions which are indeed far from being the same as those produced by real events yet do more nearly resemble the passions produced by real events than any thing which from the motions of their own minds merely other men are accustomed to feel in themselves whence and from practice he has acquired a greater readiness and power in expressing what he thinks and feels and especially those thoughts and feelings which by his own choice or from the structure of his own mind arise in him without immediate external excitement but whatever portion of this faculty we may suppose even the greatest poet to possess there cannot be a doubt but that the language which it will suggest to him must in liveliness and truth fall far short of that which is uttered by men in real life under the actual pressure of those passions certain shadows of which the poet thus produces or feels to be produced in himself however exalted a notion we would wish to cherish of the character of a poet it is obvious that while he describes and imitates passions his situation is altogether slavish and mechanical compared with the freedom and power of real and substantial action and suffering so that it will be the wish of the poet to bring his feelings near to those of the persons whose feelings he describes nay for short spaces of time perhaps to let himself slip into an entire delusion and even confound and identify his own feelings with theirs modifying only the language which is thus suggested to him by a consideration that he describes for a particular purpose that of giving pleasure here then he will apply the principle on which i have so much insisted namely that of selection on this he will depend for removing what would otherwise be painful or disgusting in the passion he will feel that there is no necessity to trick out or to elevate nature and the more industriously he applies this principle the deeper will be his faith that no words which his fancy or imagination can suggest will be to be compared with those which are the emanations of reality and truth but it may be said by those who do not object to the general spirit of these remarks that as it is impossible for the poet to produce upon all occasions language as exquisitely fitted for the passion as that which the real passion itself suggests it is proper that he should consider himself as in the situation of a translator who deems himself justified when he substitutes excellences of another kind for those which are unattainable by him and endeavours occasionally to surpass his original in order to make some amends for the general inferiority to which he feels that he must submit but this would be to encourage idleness and unmanly despair further it is the language of men who speak of what they do not understand who talk of poetry as of a matter of amusement and idle pleasure who will converse with us as gravely about a taste for poetry as they express it as if it were a thing as indifferent as a taste for rope dancing or frontiniac or sherry aristotle i have been told hath said that poetry is the most philosophic of all writing it is so its object is truth not individual and local but general and operative not standing upon external testimony but carried alive into the heart by passion truth which is its own testimony which gives strength and divinity to the tribunal to which it appeals and receives them from the same tribunal poetry is the image of man and nature the obstacles which stand in the way of the fidelity of the biographer and historian and of their consequent utility are incalculably greater than those which are to be encountered by the poet who has an adequate notion of the dignity of his art the poet writes under one restriction only namely that of the necessity of giving immediate pleasure to a human being possessed of that information which may be expected from him not as a lawyer a physician a mariner an astronomer or a natural philosopher but as a man except this one restriction there is no object standing between the poet and the image of things between this and the biographer and historian there are a thousand nor let this necessity of producing immediate pleasure be considered as a degradation of the poet s art it is far otherwise it is an acknowledgment of the beauty of the universe an acknowledgment the more sincere because it is not formal but indirect it is a task light and easy to him who looks at the world in the spirit of love further it is a homage paid to the native and naked dignity of man to the grand elementary principle of pleasure by which he knows and feels and lives and moves we have no sympathy but what is propagated by pleasure i would not be misunderstood but wherever we sympathize with pain it will be found that the sympathy is produced and carried on by subtle combinations with pleasure we have no knowledge that is no general principles drawn from the contemplation of particular facts but what has been built up by pleasure and exist in us by pleasure alone the man of science the chemist and mathematician whatever difficulties and disgusts they may have had to struggle with know and feel this however painful may be the objects with which the anatomist s knowledge is connected he feels that his knowledge is pleasure and where he has no pleasure he has no knowledge what then does the poet he considers man and the objects that surround him as acting and re acting upon each other so as to produce an infinite complexity of pain and pleasure he considers man in his own nature and in his ordinary life as contemplating this with a certain quantity of immediate knowledge with certain convictions intuitions and deductions which by habit become of the nature of intuitions he considers him as looking upon this complex scene of ideas and sensations and finding every where objects that immediately excite in him sympathies which from the necessities of his nature are accompanied by an overbalance of enjoyment to this knowledge which all men carry about with them and to these sympathies in which without any other discipline than that of our daily life we are fitted to take delight the poet principally directs his attention he considers man and nature as essentially adapted to each other and the mind of man as naturally the mirror of the fairest and most interesting qualities of nature and thus the poet prompted by this feeling of pleasure which accompanies him through the whole course of his studies converses with general nature with affections akin to those which through labour and length of time the man of science has raised up in himself by conversing with those particular parts of nature which are the objects of his studies the knowledge both of the poet and the man of science is pleasure but the knowledge of the one cleaves to us as a necessary part of our existence our natural and unalienable inheritance the other is a personal and individual acquisition slow to come to us and by no habitual and direct sympathy connecting us with our fellow beings the man of science seeks truth as a remote and unknown benefactor he cherishes and loves it in his solitude the poet singing a song in which all human beings join with him rejoices in the presence of truth as our visible friend and hourly companion poetry is the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge it is the impassioned expression which is in the countenance of all science emphatically may it be said of the poet as shakespeare hath said of man that he looks before and after he is the rock of defence of human nature an upholder and preserver carrying every where with him relationship and love in spite of difference of soil and climate of language and manners of laws and customs in spite of things silently gone out of mind and things violently destroyed the poet binds together by passion and knowledge the vast empire of human society as it is spread over the whole earth and over all time the objects of the poet s thoughts are every where though the eyes and senses of man are it is true his favorite guides yet he will follow wheresoever he can find an atmosphere of sensation in which to move his wings poetry is the first and last of all knowledge it is as immortal as the heart of man if the labours of men of science should ever create any material revolution direct or indirect in our condition and in the impressions which we habitually receive the poet will sleep then no more than at present but he will be ready to follow the steps of the man of science not only in those general indirect effects but he will be at his side carrying sensation into the midst of the objects of the science itself the remotest discoveries of the chemist the botanist or mineralogist will be as proper objects of the poet s art as any upon which it can be employed if the time should ever come when these things shall be familiar to us and the relations under which they are contemplated by the followers of these respective sciences shall be manifestly and palpably material to us as enjoying and suffering beings if the time should ever come when what is now called science thus familiarized to men shall be ready to put on as it were a form of flesh and blood the poet will lend his divine spirit to aid the transfiguration and will welcome the being thus produced as a dear and genuine inmate of the household of man it is not then to be supposed that any one who holds that sublime notion of poetry which i have attempted to convey will break in upon the sanctity and truth of his pictures by transitory and accidental ornaments and endeavour to excite admiration of himself by arts the necessity of which must manifestly depend upon the assumed meanness of his subject what i have thus far said applies to poetry in general but especially to those parts of composition where the poet speaks through the mouths of his characters and upon this point it appears to have such weight that i will conclude there are few persons of good sense who would not allow that the dramatic parts of composition are defective in proportion as they deviate from the real language of nature and are coloured by a diction of the poet s own either peculiar to him as an individual poet or belonging simply to poets in general to a body of men who from the circumstance of their compositions being in metre it is expected will employ a particular language it is not then in the dramatic parts of composition that we look for this distinction of language but still it may be proper and necessary where the poet speaks to us in his own person and character to this i answer by referring my reader to the description which i have before given of a poet among the qualities which i have enumerated as principally conducting to form a poet is implied nothing differing in kind from other men but only in degree the sum of what i have there said is that the poet is chiefly distinguished from other men by a greater promptness to think and feel without immediate external excitement and a greater power in expressing such thoughts and feelings as are produced in him in that manner but these passions and thoughts and feelings are the general passions and thoughts and feelings of men and with what are they connected undoubtedly with our moral sentiments and animal sensations and with the causes which excite these with the operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible universe with storm and sun shine with the revolutions of the seasons with cold and heat with loss of friends and kindred with injuries and resentments gratitude and hope with fear and sorrow these and the like are the sensations and objects which the poet describes as they are the sensations of other men and the objects which interest them the poet thinks and feels in the spirit of the passions of men how then can his language differ in any material degree from that of all other men who feel vividly and see clearly it might be proved that it is impossible but supposing that this were not the case the poet might then be allowed to use a peculiar language when expressing his feelings for his own gratification or that of men like himself but poets do not write for poets alone but for men unless therefore we are advocates for that admiration which depends upon ignorance and that pleasure which arises from hearing what we do not understand the poet must descend from this supposed height and in order to excite rational sympathy he must express himself as other men express themselves to this it may be added that while he is only selecting from the real language of men or which amounts to the same thing composing accurately in the spirit of such selection he is treading upon safe ground and we know what we are to expect from him our feelings are the same with respect to metre for as it may be proper to remind the reader the distinction of metre is regular and uniform and not like that which is produced by what is usually called poetic diction arbitrary and subject to infinite caprices upon which no calculation whatever can be made in the one case the reader is utterly at the mercy of the poet respecting what imagery or diction he may choose to connect with the passion whereas in the other the metre obeys certain laws to which the poet and reader both willingly submit because they are certain and because no interference is made by them with the passion but such as the concurring testimony of ages has shewn to heighten and improve the pleasure which coexists with it it will now be proper to answer an obvious question namely why professing these opinions have i written in verse to this in addition to such answer as is included in what i have already said i reply in the first place because however i may have restricted myself there is still left open to me what confessedly constitutes the most valuable object of all writing whether in prose or verse the great and universal passions of men the most general and interesting of their occupations and the entire world of nature from which i am at liberty to supply myself with endless combinations of forms and imagery now supposing for a moment that whatever is interesting in these objects may be as vividly described in prose why am i to be condemned if to such description i have endeavoured to superadd the charm which by the consent of all nations is acknowledged to exist in metrical language to this by such as are unconvinced by what i have already said it may be answered that a very small part of the pleasure given by poetry depends upon the metre and that it is injudicious to write in metre unless it be accompanied with the other artificial distinctions of style with which metre is usually accompanied and that by such deviation more will be lost from the shock which will be thereby given to the reader s associations than will be counterbalanced by any pleasure which he can derive from the general power of numbers in answer to those who still contend for the necessity of accompanying metre with certain appropriate colours of style in order to the accomplishment of its appropriate end and who also in my opinion greatly under rate the power of metre in itself it might perhaps as far as relates to these poems have been almost sufficient to observe that poems are extant written upon more humble subjects and in a more naked and simple style than i have aimed at which poems have continued to give pleasure from generation to generation now if nakedness and simplicity be a defect the fact here mentioned affords a strong presumption that poems somewhat less naked and simple are capable of affording pleasure at the present day and what i wished chiefly to attempt at present was to justify myself for having written under the impression of this belief but i might point out various causes why when the style is manly and the subject of some importance words metrically arranged will long continue to impart such a pleasure to mankind as he who is sensible of the extent of that pleasure will be desirous to impart the end of poetry is to produce excitement in co existence with an overbalance of pleasure now by the supposition excitement is an unusual and irregular state of the mind ideas and feelings do not in that state succeed each other in accustomed order but if the words by which this excitement is produced are in themselves powerful or the images and feelings have an undue proportion of pain connected with them there is some danger that the excitement may be carried beyond its proper bounds now the co presence of something regular something to which the mind has been accustomed in various moods and in a less excited state cannot but have great efficacy in tempering and restraining the passion by an intertexture of ordinary feeling and of feeling not strictly and necessarily connected with the passion this is unquestionably true and hence though the opinion will at first appear paradoxical from the tendency of metre to divest language in a certain degree of its reality and thus to throw a sort of half consciousness of unsubstantial existence over the whole composition there can be little doubt but that more pathetic situations and sentiments that is those which have a greater proportion of pain connected with them may be endured in metrical composition especially in rhyme than in prose the metre of the old ballads is very artless yet they contain many passages which would illustrate this opinion and i hope if the following poems be attentively perused similar instances will be found in them this opinion may be further illustrated by appealing to the reader s own experience of the reluctance with which he comes to the re perusal of the distressful parts of clarissa harlowe or the gamester while shakespeare s writings in the most pathetic scenes never act upon us as pathetic beyond the bounds of pleasure an effect which in a much greater degree than might at first be imagined is to be ascribed to small but continual and regular impulses of pleasurable surprise from the metrical arrangement on the other hand if the poet s words should be incommensurate with the passion and inadequate to raise the reader to a height of desirable excitement then in the feelings of pleasure which the reader bas been accustomed to connect with metre in general and in the feeling whether chearful or melancholy which he has been accustomed to connect with that particular movement of metre there will be found something which will greatly contribute to impart passion to the words and to effect the complex end which the poet proposes to himself if i had undertaken a systematic defence of the theory upon which these poems are written it would have been my duty to develope the various causes upon which the pleasure received from metrical language depends among the chief of these causes is to be reckoned a principle which must be well known to those who have made any of the arts the object of accurate reflection i mean the pleasure which the mind derives from the perception of similitude in dissimilitude this principle is the great spring of the activity of our minds and their chief feeder from this principle the direction of the sexual appetite and all the passions connected with it take their origin it is the life of our ordinary conversation and upon the accuracy with which similitude in dissimilitude and dissimilitude in similitude are perceived depend our taste and our moral feelings it would not have been a useless employment to have applied this principle to the consideration of metre and to have shewn that metre is hence enabled to afford much pleasure and to have pointed out in what manner that pleasure is produced but my limits will not permit me to enter upon this subject and i must content myself with a general summary i have said that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity the emotion is contemplated till by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears and an emotion kindred to that which was before the subject of contemplation is gradually produced and does itself actually exist in the mind in this mood successful composition generally begins and in a mood similar to this it is carried on but the emotion of whatever kind and in whatever degree from various causes is qualified by various pleasures so that in describing any passions whatsoever which are voluntarily described the mind will upon the whole be in a state of enjoyment now if nature be thus cautious in preserving in a state of enjoyment a being thus employed the poet ought to profit by the lesson thus held forth to him and ought especially to take care that whatever passions he communicates to his reader those passions if his reader s mind be sound and vigorous should always be accompanied with an overbalance of pleasure now the music of harmonious metrical language the sense of difficulty overcome and the blind association of pleasure which has been previously received from works of rhyme or metre of the same or similar construction an indistinct perception perpetually renewed of language closely resembling that of real life and yet in the circumstance of metre differing from it so widely all these imperceptibly make up a complex feeling of delight which is of the most important use in tempering the painful feeling which will always be found intermingled with powerful descriptions of the deeper passions this effect is always produced in pathetic and impassioned poetry while in lighter compositions the ease and gracefulness with which the poet manages his numbers are themselves confessedly a principal source of the gratification of the reader i might perhaps include all which it is necessary to say upon this subject by affirming what few persons will deny that of two descriptions either of passions manners or characters each of them equally well executed the one in prose and the other in verse the verse will be read a hundred times where the prose is read once we see that pope by the power of verse alone has contrived to render the plainest common sense interesting and even frequently to invest it with the appearance of passion in consequence of these convictions i related in metre the tale of goody blake and harry gill which is one of the rudest of this collection i wished to draw attention to the truth that the power of the human imagination is sufficient to produce such changes even in our physical nature as might almost appear miraculous the truth is an important one the fact is a valuable illustration of it and i have the satisfaction of knowing that it has been communicated to many hundreds of people who would never have heard of it had it not been narrated as a ballad and in a more impressive metre than is usual in ballads having thus explained a few of the reasons why i have written in verse and why i have chosen subjects from common life and endeavoured to bring my language near to the real language of men if i have been too minute in pleading my own cause i have at the same time been treating a subject of general interest and it is for this reason that i request the reader s permission to add a few words with reference solely to these particular poems and to some defects which will probably be found in them i am sensible that my associations must have sometimes been particular instead of general and that consequently giving to things a false importance sometimes from diseased impulses i may have written upon unworthy subjects but i am less apprehensive on this account than that my language may frequently have suffered from those arbitrary connections of feelings and ideas with particular words and phrases from which no man can altogether protect himself hence i have no doubt that in some instances feelings even of the ludicrous may be given to my readers by expressions which appeared to me tender and pathetic such faulty expressions were i convinced they were faulty at present and that they must necessarily continue to be so i would willingly take all reasonable pains to correct but it is dangerous to make these alterations on the simple authority of a few individuals or even of certain classes of men for where the understanding of an author is not convinced or his feelings altered this cannot be done without great injury to himself for his own feelings are his stay and support and if he sets them aside in one instance he may be induced to repeat this act till his mind loses all confidence in itself and becomes utterly debilitated to this it may be added that the reader ought never to forget that he is himself exposed to the same errors as the poet and perhaps in a much greater degree for there can be no presumption in saying that it is not probable he will be so well acquainted with the various stages of meaning through which words have passed or with the fickleness or stability of the relations of particular ideas to each other and above all since he is so much less interested in the subject he may decide lightly and carelessly long as i have detained my reader i hope he will permit me to caution him against a mode of false criticism which has been applied to poetry in which the language closely resembles that of life and nature such verses have been triumphed over in parodies of which dr johnson s stanza is a fair specimen i put my hat upon my bead and walk d into the strand and there i met another man whose hat was in his hand immediately under these lines i will place one of the most justly admired stanzas of the babes in the wood these pretty babes with hand in hand went wandering up and down but never more they saw the man approaching from the town in both these stanzas the words and the order of the words in no respect differ from the most unimpassioned conversation there are words in both for example the strand and the town connected with none but the most familiar ideas yet the one stanza we admit as admirable and the other as a fair example of the superlatively contemptible whence arises this difference not from the metre not from the language not from the order of the words but the matter expressed in dr johnson s stanza is contemptible the proper method of treating trivial and simple verses to which dr johnson s stanza would be a fair parallelism is not to say this is a bad kind of poetry or this is not poetry but this wants sense it is neither interesting in itself nor can lead to any thing interesting the images neither originate in that same state of feeling which arises out of thought nor can excite thought or feeling in the reader this is the only sensible manner of dealing with such verses why trouble yourself about the species till you have previously decided upon the genus why take pains to prove that an ape is not a newton when it is self evident that he is not a man i have one request to make of my reader which is that in judging these poems he would decide by his own feelings genuinely and not by reflection upon what will probably be the judgment of others how common is it to hear a person say i myself do not object to this style of composition or this or that expression but to such and such classes of people it will appear mean or ludicrous this mode of criticism so destructive of all sound unadulterated judgment is almost universal i have therefore to request that the reader would abide independently by his own feelings and that if he finds himself affected he would not suffer such conjectures to interfere with his pleasure if an author by any single composition has impressed us with respect for his talents it is useful to consider this as affording a presumption that on other occasions where we have been displeased he nevertheless may not have written ill or absurdly and further to give him so much credit for this one composition as may induce us to review what has displeased us with more care than we should otherwise have bestowed upon it this is not only an act of justice but in our decisions upon poetry especially may conduce in a high degree to the improvement of our own taste for an accurate taste in poetry and in all the other arts as sir joshua reynolds has observed is an acquired talent which can only be produced by thought and a long continued intercourse with the best models of composition this is mentioned not with so ridiculous a purpose as to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself but merely to temper the rashness of decision and to suggest that if poetry be a subject on which much time has not been bestowed the judgment may be erroneous and that in many cases it necessarily will be so i know that nothing would have so effectually contributed to further the end which i have in view as to have shewn of what kind the pleasure is and how that pleasure is produced which is confessedly produced by metrical composition essentially different from that which i have here endeavoured to recommend for the reader will say that he has been pleased by such composition and what can i do more for him the power of any art is limited and he will suspect that if i propose to furnish him with new friends it is only upon condition of his abandoning his old friends besides as i have said the reader is himself conscious of the pleasure which he has received from such composition composition to which he has peculiarly attached the endearing name of poetry and all men feel an habitual gratitude and something of an honorable bigotry for the objects which have long continued to please them we not only wish to be pleased but to be pleased in that particular way in which we have been accustomed to be pleased there is a host of arguments in these feelings and i should be the less able to combat them successfully as i am willing to allow that in order entirely to enjoy the poetry which i am recommending it would be necessary to give up much of what is ordinarily enjoyed but would my limits have permitted me to point out how this pleasure is produced i might have removed many obstacles and assisted my reader in perceiving that the powers of language are not so limited as he may suppose and that it is possible that poetry may give other enjoyments of a purer more lasting and more exquisite nature this part of my subject i have not altogether neglected but it has been less my present aim to prove that the interest excited by some other kinds of poetry is less vivid and less worthy of the nobler powers of the mind than to offer reasons for presuming that if the object which i have proposed to myself were adequately attained a species of poetry would be produced which is genuine poetry in its nature well adapted to interest mankind permanently and likewise important in the multiplicity and quality of its moral relations from what has been said and from a perusal of the poems the reader will be able clearly to perceive the object which i have proposed to myself he will determine how far i have attained this object and what is a much more important question whether it be worth attaining and upon the decision of these two questions will rest my claim to the approbation of the public wws note i here use the word poetry as opposed to the word prose and synonymous with metrical composition but much confusion has been introduced into criticism by this contradistinction of poetry and prose instead of the more philosophical one of poetry and matter of fact or science the only strict antithesis to prose is metre nor is this in truth a strict antithesis because lines and passages of metre so naturally occur in writing prose that it would be scarcely possible to avoid them even were it desirable14","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:
