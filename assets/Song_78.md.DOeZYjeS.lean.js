to bring love and he always filled the room with spirit the miles they traveled were long and heavy they lived in paris when she was twenty and then they moved to san francisco went back and forth to orange county the miles they traveled were long and far and there in the passenger seat of her car he took his last breath and she kissed him and she wept and she wept in the driver s seat there in the summer heat he always wanted to go to the ocean and he always kept her in constant motion and he filled her heart with happiness at the end of her walk she still hears his call from her bay window on broadway some nights she thinks she still hears his feet squeak on her apartment floor on broadway there s the woman with the neighbors who used to kindly stop and greet her until they sensed her emptiness and now they stop her less and less now she walks beside a shadow like she s led off to the gallows for he s the loveliest thing she s ever known but in time her dampened flame will grow and

the collective soul i was somewhere out on riverside by the el royale hotel when a stranger appeared in a cloud of smoke i thought i knew him all too well he said now that i have your attention i got somethin i wanna say you may not wanna hear it i m gonna tell it to ya anyway you know i ve always liked you boy cause you were not afraid of me but things are gonna get mighty rough here in gomorrah by the sea he said it s just like home it s so damned hot i can t stand it my fine seersucker suit is all soakin wet and the hills are burning the wind is raging and the clock strikes midnight in the garden of allah nice car i love those bavarians so meticulous y know i remember a time when things were a lot more fun around here when good was good and evil was evil before things got so fuzzy yeah i was once a golden boy like you i was summoned to the halls of power in the heavenly court and i dined with the deities who looked upon me with favor for my talents my creativity we sat beneath the palms in the warm afternoon and drank the wine with fitzgerald and huxley they pawned a biting phrase from tongues hot with blood and drained their pens of bitter ink vainly reaching for the bottle of empty edens branded specially for the ones who had come with great expectations to the perfumed halls of allah for their time in the sun we were stokin the fires and oilin up the machinery until the gods found out we had ideas of our own and the war was coming and the earth was shaking and there was no more room in the garden of allah today i made and appearance downtown i am an expert witness because i say i am and i said gentleman and i use that word loosely i will testify for you i m a gun for hire i m a saint i m a liar because there are no facts there is no truth just data to be manipulated i can get you any result you like what s it worth to ya because there is no wrong there is no right and i sleep very well at night no shame no solution no remorse no retribution just people selling t shirts just opportunity to participate in this pathetic little circus and winning winning winning it was a pretty big year for predators the marketplace was on a roll and the land of opportunity spawned a whole new breed of men without souls this year notoriety got all confused with fame and the devil is downhearted because there s nothing left for him to claim he said it s just like home it s so low down i can t stand it i guess my work around here has all been done and the fruit is rotten the serpent s eyes shine as he wraps around the vine in the garden of

this series of ascending and repeated intervals and this these nimble then elongated arpeggios uhmm and he actually found inspiration in a work by the english poet george meredith who died in 1909 and the composer included a portion of meredith s poem on the flyleaf andy wait uh david of the published work andy hold on wait david uhmm andy why do you keep mentioning david and it andy the year they died david well it went and it went like this it says uh spoken he rises and begins to round he drops the silver chain of sound of many links without a break in chirrup whistle slur and shake for
