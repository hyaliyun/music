dream that you apologised and you became honesty personified i hadn t seen you in the longest time so i just woke up and started writing what was on my mind i wrote five different versions of my verses trying to make the shit all perfect and it got less and less acerbic started trying to reword it i got nervous you d be hurt when you heard it till i scrapped it cause i wondered if it s worth it then i thought well fuck you yeah and fuck you from each one of yours sons too remember when i tried to visit and you just told me you were busy like you don t really ever miss me after ten years well sincerely fuck you i m tired of feeling terrible tired of tiptoeing over sugar coated eggshells i m tired of holding this grudge like a family heirloom i m tired of feeling unloved and i just want to rest now why can t it be more simple we live and learn the way it works so how can it be more simple i live and learn to let it work i ve never talked about you much before cause i avoid it it always feels uncomfortable that s why i try to keep you as a passing thought cause if i hold on i get dragged into the past with all the memories i have of getting slapped around in that apartment after you and mum divorced you ve got a lot to answer for what did you tell nana afterwards while you were stealing money out the birthday cards she passed on for us you could at least passed the cards on i mean would have been nice to hear from someone from your side of the family for once but nothing ever came i m tryna get you out my head again and all this stuff that i was scared to say i made an album that you never played you told me that so when my friends told me i should let this wait i told em fuck it he ain t gonna listen to this anyway why can t it be more simple we live and learn the way it works so how can it be more simple i live and learn to let it work  we used to watch you and your friends in a band every second weekend we d hang out when you would jam you told me i should say thanks for the genetics i have cause it lead me to rap like you wanna take the credit for that well fine but why end it at rap like how about thanks for that depression i had or what about the head full of anger the temper i have could burn bridges to ashes so i burnt weed cause it kept me from snapping ketamine xanax x or the acid whatever those tablets are in your medicine cabinet gimme the packet anything that could stop me acting edgy and anxious everything back then feels like a bunch of memory fragments so take the credit for that shit if you want it s all yours you ignored me all my life but i don t blame you anymore besides the other night i had a dream that you apologised how can it be more simple i live and learn to let it

enough not to follow in their footsteps said i should dream bigger cause they wished they coulda and that teachers never seem to get the thanks they should get well i m sorry mum and dad but i think i messed the plan up cause i m starting to think maybe i am one i stand up in front of these people class is in session pay attention requesting they put their hands up i ask the questions but you have the answers yours is the voice that makes the anthem i know it seems like nothing s going to plan but do you really think that this is random there i am looking up at the night getting lost in the

in at a time when people might not take too kindly to the likes of him now they spent their days herding cattle on the station tough times depression era rural isolation a simple life they d gather by the piano at night with poems by banjo for entertainment but that all changed in 39 with his slouch hat he shipped off for the front line fought in trenches and saw men slain from the jungles of borneo to the desert of el alamein on his way home he met a lovely nurse decided he would make her the offer that she deserved got down on one knee and asked her to take his hand and it wasn t too long before they were making plans gave me my voice to sing refrain you ve felt it all hunger to a war of pain you gave me fire to build my path each stepping stone a lesson from your winding past and as i stand my outstretched hand reaches for you to show my gratitude a presence from before my time traces that i m bound to carry down the line fast forward now the boy s a man with children of his own colts roaming on the farmstead that they call home days turned to years as the steam rose from the puffing billy and weathered hands worked the shears through flood and drought he kept food in the family s mouths his four kids getting taller now each climbed to the top of that old pine tree just to make believe they could see all the way to sydney the second son watched the setting sun through his window with dreams of making his home in the big smoke so he finished school and headed to university determined he would be the one to get the family s first degree one of the lucky ones his birthday missed the draft as his friends headed off to vietnam horror on the evening news on the tv set made him join the march in the streets in protest between studying and going to home to work every summer he met a pretty girl and fell in love put a ring on the finger of his beauty they had two sons the youngest was none other than yours truly  so here i stand the grandson of a drover a strong man who sang songs watching over his land so i know where i get the damn nerve from to step up on the stage and make the people throw their hands flipping through these old photographs all the poems he d recite and the notes he sang flashed before my eyes as he lay with the family gathered round his bed on that anzac day and the last post played on the tv in the hallway as he passed away and i said to myself that i wasn t gonna cry as the tears rolled down my face i stood by and watched it unwind following the bloodline as the life flowed out his veins but he remains every time that i speak my rhyme he lives on in what i leave behind another down the line it s that beautiful but tragic fate that awaits us all sure as the seed grows to the tree its leaves will fall we free fall into

knew that you couldn t so you put on a brave face and waited till you could make your escape and when you finally got away from the people and the gossip and the judgement in their gaze you let your guard down and somethin just gave all of a sudden tears fallin till they re runnin down your face whatever it was you fought with your friend or your boss or maybe you got a heart that won t mend or you strugglin with the rent or missin someone you lost or maybe you just tired of pretendin you feel the weight like a pain in your chest till you strain and you ache and you break and you sob and it s grey till it stops till it fades till it s gone like the tears sorta washed it all away sometimes i like to think it s the same with drops of rain that each one s just a tear fallin off of god s face sittin all alone in the clouds lookin down on us all watchin every mistake that was ever made every bit of pain every murder every rape every person who s havin a shitty day takin it all in till he breaks down and cries till his eyes dry up and he gets on with it again and i had this very faith tested on an ordinary day i was walkin down a busy street around my way i saw a face in the crowd that made my heart skip a beat a man who looked exactly like an older version of me so l moved through the hustle and the bustle of the day to day until me and this man stood face to face we locked eyes and for a moment time moved in slow motion as the crowd around continued on their paper chase i stood frozen in disbelief and opened my mouth to speak but to my surprise the words wouldn t come and then he looks into a clear blue sky up above and says it s gonna rain and then it does and as the rain came down like missiles from the sky set on a collision course from the heavens to the ground he s just standin in the middle of it all unconcerned by the panic and the people runnin round so i stepped to this man with my hand outstretched just to offer him some help to get the storm up off his head he took my hand down and we stood gettin drenched he looked me in the eyes and with a smile this is what he said hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain so play this song on the days when the rain keeps on and you wait and you pray it ll stop and if you stuck in a storm then spare a second for the thought that we all at the mercy of the gods so instead of lookin for somewhere to place the blame accept it as a part of that big lazy eight go outside and stand under the clouds and embrace it as the rain keeps plummetin down and say hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain from the million dollar brands to the tags on the train it ll all wash away in the rain from the birth to the dirt man the cradle to the grave it ll all wash away in the rain what s been and gone will come again it ll all wash away in the rain so hush child from the joy to the pain it ll all wash away in the rain  ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba

when i was five or six we were camping in the islands in july the tall yellow grass and the rose hips fragrant after sunset island beyond island undulating and familiar not far from home with my fragrant whittled cedar driftwood dagger in the mildew canvas tent i saw fireworks many miles away but didn t hear them and i felt a longing a childish melancholy and then i went to sleep and the aching was buried dreaming aging reaching for an idea of somewhere other than this place that could fold me in clouded yearning for nowhere actually reachable the distance was the point and then when i was twenty four i followed this ache to an arctic norwegian cabin where i said fuck the world in a finally satisfying way i stayed through the winter and emerged as an adult holding a letter from you an invitation so i flew back and drove back and when we met in person it was instant it didn t matter where we lived as long as we were together and that was really true for thirteen years and the whole time still slow pulsing red tower lights across a distance refuge in the dust in january you were alive still but chemo had ravaged and transformed your porcelain into some other thing something jaundiced and fucked they put you in the hospital in everett so i gave the baby away and drove up and down i 5 every night like a satellite bringing you food that you wanted returning at night to sleep in our bed cold i went back to feel alone there all past selves and future possibilities on hold while i tore through the dark on the freeway the old yearning burning in me i knew exactly where the road bent around where the trees opened up and i could see way above the horizon beyond innumerable islands the towers on top of the mountain lit up slowly silently beaconing as if to say just keep going there is a place where a wind could erase this for you and the branches could white noise you back awake so i went back to feel alone there but cradled you in me in the national gallery in oslo there s a painting called soria moria a kid looks across a deep canyon of fog at a lit up inhuman castle or something i have not stopped looking across the water from the few difficult spots where you can see that the distance from this haunted house where i live to soria moria is a real traversable space i m an arrow now midair slow pulsing red tower lights across a distance refuge in
