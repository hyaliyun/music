too much but then i think about the lives i ve touched back when i wasn t thirsty for mainstream attention when i was geeked on a retweet or a single mention when i wasn t too concerned about keeping my platform when it was ten in the crowd i was happy to rap for em i wasn t too busy to pick up the phone back when i was geeked just to get a beep from tony stone now they like happy you back it was

this way dad well even from the beginning men hated jesus even thought he did nothing but love them and teach them and heal them they nailed him to a cross they thought they had killed him but they only set him free to live in the hearts of people like you and me who believe in him then came the apostles and most of them were killed for telling other people about jesus so they tortured them and killed them and even left their bodies to rot as an example to other people but the church kept right on growing watered by the blood of these precious saints son but dad did they want to die dad no they didn t want to die i mean many of them had children just like you they had to leave behind but they were forced to make a choice they could choose to live this one life here on earth and reject jesus and be damned or they could to believe in the words of jesus and live forever son i think i understand dad here maybe this will help you understand ray boltz i have heard how christians long ago were brought before a tyrants throne and they were told that he would spare their lives if they would renounce the name of christ but one by one they chose to die the son of god they would not deny like a great angelic choir sings i can almost hear their voices ring chorus i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb ray boltz now the years have come and the years have gone but the cause of jesus still goes on and now our time has come to count the cost to reject this world to embrace the cross and one by one let us live our lives for the one who died to give us life till the trumpet sounds on the final day let us proudly stand and boldly say repeat chorus i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb to the lamb of god who bore my pain who took my place who wore my shame i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb you ve got to remember the it wasn t always this way i mean my dad could even pray in school of course they took that away from him then it became incorrect for us to believe in the bible and after that they just stripped our right to worship away from us and we quietly stood by but son i hope that you re never in the position that you have to choose between your faith and your life but if you are i know which choice you re going to make because i know that jesus lives inside of you in the meantime just pray like i taught you to and take care of your mom and remember that god is the father of the fatherless repeat chorus i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i will seek to honor his commands i pledge allegiance to the lamb i pledge allegiance to the lamb with all my strength with all i am i

piece of shit yup if your reason for doing it is you couldnt get a babysitter well then you dont get to go to the movies thats how that works it happened to me in back to back movies which statistically i did not think was possible first movie im in there five minutes im watching the movie and i hear waaah what i turn and in the row behind me theres a mother a father and a baby not a child which i think is an important distinction its a baby im like all right these people are insane um ill just ignore this turn back 30 seconds later waah im like well now i have to say something now im polite so i turn and i go excuse me are you stabbing your baby right now cause it sounds like it and the dad goes no i love the baby you picture him okay i love him pero no its my baby and i said well could you cause im trying to watch this movie and your babys ruining it and he was like no no puedo so i get up i go to the lobby i see the manager of the theater and i go hey theres a fucking baby in there being a baby right now and the manager goes some people suck and he walked away that is the best customer service line ive ever heard in my life hands down you cant even get mad if youre in a restaurant been waiting on your food like where the fuck is my food ive been here half an hour and the managers like some people suck you d be like oh yeah some people suck i didnt think about it my bad sorry about that i left i left the next day i go back to the movies i should point out i saw a different movie it was also a different baby its not the same family standing out front and then they see me and theyre like oh there he is lets go inside and ruin this for him again this time i am way further into the movie im emotionally invested in this movie i like the movie and then out of nowhere i hear waah this time i swear to you i audibly go nuh uh and now other people get involved you know when you can hear somebodys age in their voice like i cant see shit its a dark theater i just hear a guy go either make it quiet or get it out that guys 140 years old like i could hear that hed never hugged his children i could hear it in his voice this time the mother of the baby goes shut up and i was like oh shit like we have a situation and then a third person goes shh what are you doing shush is passive aggressive she said shut up just go straight to fuck you what are you doing but now i wanted to be the hero and like save the movie i felt a tremendous sense of injustice like all these movies are being ruined by babies but i didnt realize i was too angry in that moment to um what is it speak english words in a sentence you know when you get real rage like like just dude like like you feel it your throat dries out and aah so i stood up in the theater with the best intentions and i went why is everybody not in the adult movie like none of it made sense everybodys like whos that fucking guy whats his problem i was i was trying to say lets be civilized adults but instead i went adult movie porns on now cover your babys eyes the next thing i see a white t shirt pop up and im like well theres the dad some of you got it and he looked around like whos talking shit and i was like im talking shit bitch i didnt say it but he knew what was up but then i went out the exit immediately cause im not getting my ass kicked over the lego movie so i
