found this one s mine just then the lord himself appeared in a blinding flash of light and shouted at the devil get thee hence to endless night but the devil just grinned and said i may have sinned but there s no need to push me around i got here first so you can do your worst he s going underground but i think i ll give you one more chance said the devil with a smile so throw away that stupid lance it s really not your style joker is the name poker is the game we ll play right here on this bed and then we ll bet for the biggest stakes yet the souls of the dead and i said look out lord he s going to win the sun is down and the night is riding in that train is dead on time many souls are on the line oh lord he s going to win well the railwayman he cut the cards and he dealt them each a hand of five and for the lord he was praying hard for that train he d have to drive well the devil he had three aces and a king and the lord he was running for a straight he had the queen and the knave and nine and ten of spades all he needed was the eight and then the lord he called for one more card but he drew the diamond eight and the devil said to the son of god i believe you ve got it straight so deal me one for the time has come to see who ll be the king of this place but as he spoke from beneath his cloak he slipped another ace ten thousand souls was the opening bid and it soon went up to fifty nine but the lord didn t see what the devil did and he said that suits me fine i ll raise you high to a hundred and five and forever put an end to your sins but the devil let out a mighty shout my hand wins  and i said lord oh lord you let him win the sun is down and the night is riding in that train is dead on time many souls are on the line oh lord don t let him win well that spanish train still runs between guadalquivir and old seville and at dead of night the whistle blows and people fear she s running still and far away in some recess the lord and the devil are now playing chess the devil still cheats and wins more souls and as for the lord well he s just doing his best and i said lord oh lord you ve got to win the sun is down and the night is riding in that

you ll work all damn day but you will never see a check in the field cotton you yield your skin peels off your back from the crack of the whip it won t heal ya wish you had a shield cause he wields iron so when you act up he smokes ya and keeps firing and it s tiring forget about recreation one wrong move and it s death you re facing white motha fuckaz got the ball and chain on your leg and in the form of religion on your brain they say you the devil you say who the devil some of us was house niggers some of us was rebels some tried to get along the best they could and didn t nobody use the phrase it s all good would you they got you living like a shrew they throw you pig lips and chicken gizzards then you make a stew they give us a white jesus to appease us we talk among ourselves and hope that nobody sees us they had our brothers beating us called us cretins plus monkeys they just funkies mistreating us the master said if you don t whip em you re dead it was fucking with his head but he beat us instead and we bled red blood flowing like a flood then he d rape your mother stick her face in the mud they were ruthless if you tried to front you d be toothless some tried to run even though it seemed useless virginity was torn soon babies was born that was half white and now his skin is kind of light you think you re special because they let you oversee the carnage but i bet you will get hung even if you stick out your tongue cause they pull out the shank and stick it right through your lung now it s 96 and white people say forget it it s all in the past and some even regret it cause they think we ll set it now my missions to get federal so i can raise a black family without you devils and you know how that goes the slave master watching over you always trying to tell you what the fuck to do the slave master watching over you but ain t nothing gonna stop me and my crew this is for you kids trying to get signed just a little something you should keep in mind the labels are slave masters artists are slaves don t get too raunchy they want you to behave you get signed you re thinking this is great but wait you never knew what was at stake creative control they withhold you sell your soul when you sign on the dotted line hoping to go gold but you ll never see that not without promotion the label ll just throw your shit out and got it floatin you think your shit is potent but ain t nobody buying it if they ain t never heard of it ain t nobody trying it if they ain t never heard of it your record they murder it you can complain but they are not concerned a bit cause when they signed you they thought you d make a hit cause of who you was affiliated with and all that bullshit frustrations all these rules and regulations just so you can have your shit heard by the nation and be patient cause by the time they find a lead release your shit is ancient you think they re working your album you re mistaken and if you flop you get dropped cause you ain t the star you didn t go pop just straight up hip hop time to get a mop cause without no promotion of course sales drop peep the break down if tapes cost 10 you ll probably only get to see a dollar in the end that you cannot spend cause your budget gets recouped so you never get cash unless your record is shoop you better hope you get shows which will not happen if you don t have a record that s the main attraction even if you sell a million you ll get burned cause they keep half your cash just in case of returns for a while you wonder why rappers don t smile cause to them you re not an artist you re just another file another nigga used to make another buck they don t give a fuck and if your shit don t blow up tough but the star gets both promotion and devotion from the whole fucking staff at you they laugh the star probably don t know that he the house nigga thinking he bigger cause he the pick of the litter these labels think backwards they push the acts that need it the least so they can get all the money they can when it s released they take you to a restaurant for a feast and then expect you to pick up the check that s why i give props to niggas who is independent cause they make they own money plus decide how to spend it splendid and let s end it and don t get offended

unless you go to chinatown they bite your nose off hey you need something for pain and then the colored girls they walk over guess what they said doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo wait baby i was gone tell you how i came to write a song called walk on the wild side i did not think of it myself right that s how i got on this one i had walked out just when i made an album called loaded for loaded yeah that s right because i saw it coming and said oh oh get lost so i walked right because we were gonna be very successful and there could be money there and these are my rounds so i became a typist for my old man forty dollars a week he says stupid i said yeah but i never said i was smart i don t want the company man you know i have had two jobs one s with a guy in jones beach you know the stick with the pin lasted one day a guy threw an orange peel down here in the trash i say you gotta be kiddin man i got a stick with a pin in it so he put me in the pool area the guy who walks around when you put your stuff like in the fucking chair and they say if you leave and don t take your stuff with you we throw it in the water that was an afternoon i said what do you say can t you read the sign i was one of them wow that was i was shocked i was appalled i was taken aback and then he saw so the guys who did the threepenny opera this is all true call me up of all things they say we think you are a very literate rock n roll person and after ray davies we think that you are the person that could take nelson algren s book walk on the wild side and do like a musical thing for all of broadway i said i said you gotta be kiddin it s about cripples in the ghetto man what are you out of your mind they said oh but you know very serious intense forty ish hippies like gray hair park avenue apartments i m a fucking typist at this point you gotta understand man people saying oh lou you re so these assholes wanna treat me for a book that s about cripples i m the best qualified person to write a book about cripples in music kill yourself man that s better than being a garage mechanic i think as long as i keep thinking that you know and why what s the truth i keep saying the genie will appear and say hey schmuck it was really groovy all the time being that garage mechanic out in icelight and i would say oh wow why didn t you tap me on the shoulder because you wouldn t listen fair enough so they give they they say go buy a paperback version and they didn t even give me a version i said is it abridged oh the movie with jane fonda they said then now you got it i like to look at jane fonda don t wanna hear her now i don t even want to look at her you know i don t like the sensitive lesbian pictures look i i don t relate you know backward i don t relate and facing front is hopeless so i read this fucking book and i they said will you make an x where you think the song should go haha the cripple goes to the bathroom oh oh yeah cripple cripple i i got jammed for a few times i had nothing to say to them so then it became a challenge so i figured why don t i write the theme song for walk on the wild side i call it walk on the wild side that s smart so i had a great time with nothing to write about this stupid fucking book man everybody says the guy is brilliant i said he s from chicago saul bellow oh so anyway then they got mahogony that that play that flopped diana ross getting diana ross by the way is great as a person she hasn t any good record at the time love hangover is not she says that s more than you do so anyway i had a great title and nothing else and then they fired me i mean they did it really gently they let me down easily and they said lou man we ve got a chance to produce mahogany on broadway i said oh wow am i crushed ha break a leg i read that book go get them man look advance the theatre haha bruce you got to believe me man these these people exist till the play bombed because assholes like robert christgau said it was terrible and in this case it was and i wouldn t go in the first place but there i was writing the song for these assholes anyway so then i had a great time writing i figured i will save this title

was a beautiful place with fantastic weather and the payses and the extranjeros they were here they were most of them were americans canadians swedish and um painters artists fantastic people there were no classes the houses they were open nobody closed the doors it was a great great uh life i came in 1972 and um i came i arrived to an island which was virgin nature and sunny there s flowers and everything was green and uh it was just so overwhelming that i couldn t believe it it just uh it just hit me so strongly that i uh felt like being in paradise in spanish it s anna maria noche y da it s mean ana maria day and night because i was everywhere i don t want to lose one minute of this party or in the beach or in the discotheques everywhere i was i tried to be all around the island always twenty four hours i was sleeping nothing just few hours sometimes when my body was going to die when i start to work in pacha they tell me you can be go go dancer and i said yes but please with one clause at five o clock in the morning i want to go away and then the boss of the dancer in this time she say the okay you can do it but straight up don t say this to anyone and when it s five o clock you just take the door and go where you want and so five o clock every night when i finished work i ran to dance in another discotheque and i ran to ku to make more friends here around like this uh it was okay  the minute i came here just getting out of the plane landing in ibiza i knew this was my place forever i don t know even the smell i adored i felt this is my home my name is rossetta montenegro i was born in venezuela but i live many part of the planet so i got to meet so many people everyone came to see me in ibiza during those days and now still i work in um pacha i work in ku i

really freak you know i mean we were freak we used to get whatever a bottle of coke we d cut it and we d make uh two things for a bra you know it was really funny the fantasy that all the people used to have that time at least at that time we used to have two or three pareo you can you wear it on the head over the the shoulders as a child and we only carry a basket this incan basket with all our stuff there so we didn t have to go to our house to get things you know no it was easy going you know we used to go to the disco without barefoot in bathing suits with a pareo and sometimes people naked full of colors and things you know but uh flowers all over going close to paradise but we took the wrong way i don t know maybe this is the right way we don t know but it didn t go the way we were expecting when i say we i m talking about all these freaks then we had dreams somebody asked me about her and then what do you think about that and i say that would ve been that s what i really believed it was a paradise absolute paradise somehow it took a way then became what it is now and i m sure people that arrive now are still thinking that that s a paradise definitely it s not the
