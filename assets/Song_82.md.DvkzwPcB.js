folks people hurried by gray shadows on a distant wall it was getting late and no money to score he turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife cab stop just ahead under a streetlight boy got out with a suitcase thin kid in prep school clothes familiar face the priest told himself watching from the doorway reminds me of something a long time ago the boy there with his overcoat unbuttoned reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare the cab drove away and turned the corner the boy went inside a building hmm yes maybe the suitcase was there in the doorway the boy nowhere in sight gone to get the keys most likely have to move fast he picked up the suitcase and started for the corner made it glanced down at the case it didn t look like the case the boy had or any boy would have the priest couldn t put his finger on what was so old about the case old and dirty poor quality leather and heavy better see what s inside he turned into lincoln park found an empty place and opened the case two severed human legs that belonged to a young man with dark skin shiny black leg hairs glittered in the dim streetlight the legs had been forced into the case and he had to use his knee on the back of the case to shove them out legs yet he said and walked quickly away with the case might bring a few dollars to score the buyer sniffed suspiciously kind of a funny smell about it it s just mexican leather well some joker didn t cure it the buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor not even right sure he killed it whatever it is three is the best i can do and it hurts but since this is christmas and you re the priest he slipped three notes under the table into the priest s dirty hand the priest faded into the street shadows seedy and furtive three cents didn t buy a bag nothing less than a nickel say remember that old addie croaker told me not to come back unless i paid him the three cents i owe him yeah isn t that a fruit for ya blow your stack about three lousy cents the doctor was not pleased to see him now what do you want i told you the priest laid three bills on the table the doctor put the money in his pocket and started to scream i ve had trouble people have been around i may lose my license the priest just sat there eyes old and heavy with years of junk on the doctor s face i can t write you a prescription the doctor jerked open a drawer and slid an ampule across the table that s all i have in the office the doctor stood up take it and get out he screamed hysterical the priest s expression did not change the doctor added in quieter tones after all i m a professional man and i shouldn t be bothered by people like you is that all you have for me one lousy quarter g couldn t you lend me a nickel get out get out i ll call the police i tell you all right doctor i m going of course it was cold and far walk to rooming house a shabby street room on the top floor these stairs coughed the priest there pulling himself up along the bannister he went into the bathroom yellow wall panels toilet dripping and got his works from under the washbasin wrapped in brown paper back to his room get every drop in the dropper he rolled up his sleeve then he heard a groan from next door room 18 the mexican kid lived there the priest had passed him on the stairs and saw the kid was hooked but he never spoke because he didn t want any juvenile connections bad news in any language the priest had had enough bad news in his life he heard the groan again a groan he could feel no mistaking that groan and what it meant maybe he had an accident or something in any case i can t enjoy my priestly medications with that sound coming through the wall thin walls you understand the priest put down his dropper cold hall and knocked on the door of room 18 quien es it s the priest kid i live next door he could hear someone hobbling across the floor a bolt slid the boy stood there in his underwear shorts eyes black with pain he started to fall the priest helped him over to the bed what s wrong son it s my legs seor cramps and now i am without medicine the priest could see the cramps like knots of wood there in the young legs dark shiny black leg hairs a few years ago i damaged myself in a bicycle race it was then that the cramps started and now he has the leg cramps back with compound junk interest the old priest stood there feeling the boy groan he inclined his head as if in prayer went back and got his dropper it s just a quarter g kid i do not require much seor the boy was sleeping when the priest left room 18 he went back to his room and sat down on the bed then it hit him like heavy silent snow all the gray junk yesterdays he sat there received the immaculate fix and since he was himself a priest there was

it s in the way we fuck it s in the way you make me need it s in the way you cry to get just what you fucking need it s in the way you cut so you can see me bleed it s in the way you see that i am just another face these walls come crashing down and now it all decays we take the life we once embraced it slips away the curse of emptiness and time will have its way the loneliness enables us to medicate a beating heart that s bleeding atrophy a broken spirits animosity the wound inside is that which cannot heal destroying dreams that we will never feel i m just your dead excuse and it s a broken future now it s not a happy ending it s just a faded picture of what we could never be i can t erase the pain the final hope has become one we perceive to be dead these walls come crashing down and now it all decays we take the life we once embraced it slips away the curse of emptiness and time will have its way the loneliness enables us to medicate you kill a gentle soul for personal gain and by doing so you re a fucking murderer this blood is on your hands there is no light at the end of this tunnel when i close my eyes all i see is the dark cloud that i protected you from it took 90 pounds of flesh to get me here the illusion of love given by all the shit surrounding me love is just a fucking dream and now turned to death once righteous i am now a burnt and broken man brought on to me by the pathetic excuse of a life i ll take comfort in the dark with all of my sins there is no return back to light from this hell i m in it s fucking done this is never coming back divided accepted the fact that it all adds up to nothing the anger denial acceptance it s clear the way you re always your own victim another bad decision to trust with my life on the line and now i m dead

read the prayer the text was taken up next those of the boys who had a prayer book took them out but this one boy only had a deck of cards and so he spread them out the sergeant saw the cards and said soldier put away those cards after the services were over the soldier was taken prisoner and brought before the provost marshall the marshall said sergeant why have you brought this man here for playing cards in church sir and what have you to say for yourself son much sir replied the soldier the marshall said i hope so for if not i shall punish you more than any man was ever punished the soldier said sir i have been on a march for about six days and i had neither bible nor prayer book but i hope to satisfy you sir with the purity of my intentions with that the boy started his story you see sir when i look at the ace it reminds me that there is but one god the deuce reminds me that the bible is divided into two parts the old and new testaments and when i see the trey i think of the father son and holy ghost when i see the four i think of the four evangelist who preached the gospel there was matthew mark luke and john and when i see the five it reminds me of the five wise virgins who trimmed their lamps ten of em five who were wise and were saved five were foolish and were shut out and when i see the six it reminds me that in six days god made this great heaven and earth and when i see the seven it reminds me that on the seventh day god rested from his great work when i see the eight i think of the eight righteous persons god saved when he destroyed this earth there was noah his wife their three sons and their wives and when i see the nine i think of the lepers our savior cleansed and nine of the ten didn t even thank him when i see the ten i think of the

words i m right you don t have to be so scared to share what s inside cause you re daddy s little superstar and you re mama s little butterfly fly high but of course the fight ends with no resolution merely a vow for retribution substitution execution electrocution ruthless toothless and truthless mumbling through page after page of excuses abuses of the gift of the gab gabriel the trumpeter bestowed upon us a voice with a choice and a tongue kept moist by years of salivating for oysters pearls and aphrodisiacs locked in an ugly shell always too chewy and gooey so they get swallowed whole but a tongue is so much more than a vehicle for greed a tongue is for washing fur or for licking wounds or for welcoming newcomers into a room or cleansing those fresh from the womb without a tongue there would be no croons swoons junes under the moon no bees pollinating no flowers in bloom no recitation of words at the foot of a tomb or wills read aloud of the family heirlooms you probably couldn t even blow up a balloon and that would be a shame because to exhales the name of the game exhale from the heart not from the lungs exhale from the heart not from the tongue  listening is understanding and finding compassion love is the action of soul satisfaction a tongue can make wishes and also fine kisses taste a sweet cake and also cast disses but nothing compares to the voice from within without it we might just be mannequins up to no darn good shenanigans learn to be skilful movers of the stones that block the heart and turn humans to clones learn to forgive set free the

the business of begging forgiveness while frantically running around putting out fires but then what kind of scale compares the weight of two beauties the gravity of duties or the ground speed of joy tell me what kind of gauge can quantify elation what kind of equation could i possibly employ and you ll never know dear just how much i loved you you probably think this was just my big excuse but i stand committed to a love that came before you and the fact that i adore you is just one of my truths so i i m goin home to please the one i so love pleasing and i don t expect he ll have much
