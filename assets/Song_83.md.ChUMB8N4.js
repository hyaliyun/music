blasting you dorks every songs about fashion of sorts glasses and shorts and spending cash on a massive resort and that s fine go ahead and flash your cadillac and a porsche but if you get asked about the cultures past give an accurate source and that s the ignorance that these industry bastards endorse and the masses support now the rations of real passion are short go back to the start of the

dark i could not see clearly such its long stretched highway the other road was golden and glowing and shined as bright as day and i did remember stories of pearly gates golden streets or howhowever those stories were told i knew id reach heaven on this highway if not id have the gold i took one footstep feeling safe and acting bold suddenly i realized my mistake my chosen road turned black bitterly and white cold no longer was it golden glory nor heaven that it s in white hot flames were blazing i saw the devil with his grin i had taken but one footstep so i turned to hurry back but
