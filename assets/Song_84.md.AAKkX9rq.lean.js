will also die and therefore their being at last will have been but a lie if no one is left to remember their sorrowful story when nobody tells the sad tale no one s there to be sorry imagine a night stygian black while you re cosy and warm imagine the howling of some ineluctable storm so if you are ready and i ve got your outright attention i m ready to unveil the story of old foremar mansion where a family lived long ago but what makes it so weird is not that they lived there but rather that they disappeared there wasn t a soul from the great hall to the smallest pantry the great foremar manor henceforward forever stood empty they lived in a house built on dreams and built of burnt bricks tarted up impressed by themselves as they swaggered gave a home to many good friends and to some rascal tricks sirens lured could it be that they followed and staggered did they care for anyone else except for themselves so why should anyone care for them now empty rooms not very much left on the old rotten shelves they ended in smoke but you cannot say how but they all are long since gone it s a riddle what went wrong scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here nor do we know why they disappeared why they all have long since gone maybe there lived too many monsters under their stairs we don t know if they all were led or were banished did they see strange eyes in the night that gave them a stare did they flee just head over heals as they vanished no one knows if they were driven or if they were led dusty rooms no more servants to clear away plates did they cry or did they move on without any regrets no farewells no more talks and no boring debates but they all are long since gone it s a riddle what went wrong scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here nor do we know why they disappeared why they all have long since gone the only things found were remains of the poor chained unwanted cousin he had been slightly insane from below stairs there was babbling and buzzing he just didn t suit couldn t fit so he was locked up in the cellar displeasing he sat in the pit until he passed poor little fella but they all are long since gone it s a riddle what went wrong scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here nor do we know why they disappeared why they all have long since gone glooming stars or did they run off for a shimmer of gold no regrets they re all gone without any trace far away or are they still prowling around in the cold pictures fade can t remember a name or a face but they all are long since gone it s a riddle what went wrong but they all are long since gone it s a riddle what went wrong scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here nor do we know why they disappeared why they all have long since gone but they all have long since

s your life as soon as i wake up i m gonna change my ways cause the music s my savior and no one can take my pain except for this paper the page it flows like rain as soon as i wake up i m gonna

outloud and complain to them i figure i m made to live and haven t gone that far but i made it here so if there is a god i give thanks to him then i take the pen and make amends again the only way i know to repent i know somebody s listenin dear god i m so thankful for you keeping my plate full the struggles heartache pain the progress and the breakthrough every single track has made who i am to this day through this page is the only way to paint you but lately it s like my soul feels counterfeit scared to pick up the pen to see what the hell might come out of it so god grant me the serenity without giving me the christening because all i ever needed was a beat and people listening step cousins as soon as i wake up i m gonna change my ways cause the music s my savior and no one can take

lid and ive had enough of it emotions are dangerous like giving a drug to kids so many people are dependent on love like a vampire needs blood to live and they wonder why i show no emotion you can wanna cry for so low youre roasting i can feel the high with no roller coasting part of me has died let go shows devotion i did away with all the feelings that reside within me and there were plenty now inside theres nothing the type of void thatll make you wanna kill and the only time i feel is when im fucking i think ive lost my mind again its idling i maybe need a vitamin some niacin i never need to cry again i feel like the sad sound of a violin cause ive decided in letting all my feelings go now im no longer feeling low but sometimes i feel like a sociopath and i think i might be going into killing mode i walk around with a blank stare hoes looking for love i cant give it it aint there thats attention i cant spare and i cant care if you think that it aint fair im completely jaded and that shit swallows innocent lives but i do not waddle sit and then cry im emotionally hollow on the inside you see i used to have nothing but love inside of me but too many people stabbed me in the back and lied to me i used to think that my loved ones would all be there for me but now i choose who i let in my circle way more carefully and now im jaded its a miracle i made it every time i ve tried to show love all they show me back is hatred this life does not treat me gently ive given it all i can and now im completely empty call me the hollow man if everything happens for a reason was i meant to be this way i dont really see another option turning cold is the only way i live to see this day i await to higher rates of lying snakes who try and hate so many people that i used to have

behind your back and debating and hating on you and plotting on making another move guess satan awakened within em giving them a minimum of hesitation they leave me aching but the signs is vacant

contemplatin where did i go wrong try to hold on be strong hard to feel that home when there s no place for me to belong i guess it s back to packin down these back roads with a black hole inside my chest that used to hold a soul maybe when it s all done i can finally realize why i felt alone through this journey of my life and everything will finally make sense to me one day but until then i

they are like knives and if you think he s ugly wait till you see his insides oh don t you sail and don t you row and certainly don t you swim cause if you aren t careful you ll end up inside of him he ll eat you up and spit you out you better stay away heed the sign that says beware the beast of pirate s bay some say he s a serpent that came straight from hell to eat the souls of pirates and other ne er do wells some they don t believe it as for me i ve got a hunch cause they used to have some pirates here but he ate them all for lunch don t you sail and don t you row and certainly don t you swim cause if you aren t careful you ll end up inside of him he ll eat you up and spit you out you better stay away heed the sign that says beware the beast of pirate s bay well captain hook you

hooks on both his hands  oh don t you sail and don t you row and certainly don t you swim cause if you aren t careful you ll end up inside of him he ll eat you up and spit you out you better stay away heed the sign that says beware the beast of pirate s bay well blackbeard the pirate you know for what he s feared it s mostly for that dark imposing color of his beard he saw the beast and now nobody

of him he ll eat you up and spit you out you better stay away heed the sign that says beware the beast of pirate s bay well now the tavern s empty and there s only you and me and if you care i d like to share how this song came to be so come a little closer if you really want to know this very sad and woeful tale that happened so long ago well i was just a little boy when i went to pirate s bay and there i saw a creature that was very much dismayed with a harpoon in his dorsal fin and a hook stuck in his side this mighty whale was in such pain we both began to cry i pushed and i shoved but he would not give way into the deeper waters of our shallow pirate s bay all i could do to help him was to keep people away so i wrote a sign that said beware the beast of pirate s bay what did it say don t you sail and don t you row and certainly don t you swim cause if you aren t careful you ll end up inside of him he ll eat you up and spit you out so you better stay away heed the sign that says
