boy doing what a little boy do til somebody stole his bike swearing up and down they would pay the price a police officer overheard laughed at the child and gave advice told him to take that rage to fight come to my gym and train to fight little did he know that would change his life make him a star put his name in lights as an amateur he would bandage up anyone he faced due to his tutelage even then you knew the kid was destined to be great golden child 8 golden gloves on the road to olympic gold in rome everything he dreamed got his ticket then his feet got cold praying in the aisles on the way to the fight he made it and in that 1960 olympics victory he declared himself the greatest critics watched and frowned at his boxing style said he couldn t keep his guard up he wasn t pro and they still couldn t knock him down uh hands low damn he can dance though made em look too stiff to box a punch too quick to clock you get hit before you get from tick to tock uh and by 64 he was giving knockout predictions what round they would hit the floor ridiculing his opposition dismissed as the louisville lip outspoken but never out boxed liston finally gave in and clay got his first title shot he even put out an album threw a few sonny poems together and called it i am the greatest some say the first battle raps ever he said he d knock him out in eight but nobody believed nobody listened til the headlines came cassius clay beats sonny liston and after that huge upset he upset the world when he announced he was a member of the nation of islam he lashed back like what was it i did wrong huh and in the fashion of malcolm x for whom he had profound respect from his slave name he said i m free and he became young muhammad ali then the love for him got outweighed by outrage and fear of his new devout faith to an organization perceived as only being about hate years later he refused the draft denounced the war on the grounds of religious beliefs then they hated him more they told him go to jail or go to vietnam then they took his title and his boxing license so he took it to court and fought three years long now somewhere in that time america realized the war was wrong and he went from traitor to hero and in a year or so he was coming back strong uh moving with such grace and ease float like a butterfly sting like a bee hand can t hit what your eyes can t see then came the fight of the century ali joe frasier as far as match ups there were no greater first professional loss but he would beat him in a rematch later but by then frasier lost the belt to a man by the name of george foreman much stronger and younger than ali still he said i m in if you re in then came the rumble in the jungle promoted by don king in 74 they went to zaire he got out the plane like what do i hear they were saying it was much more than some ego stroke he knew he gave the poor people hope against the odds toe to toe swarming crowds overflow but no matter how hard he fought they said foreman would never be stopped but instead of going blow for blow he let him go for broke punched himself out later they would call it the rope a dope and in the eighth round everything turned around ali springs from the ropes swinging fearlessly and foreman goes down and the whole crowd erupts in amazement when he can t beat the count and a new king is crowned fighting for the poor and oppressed his victory made history but it was more than just being the best it was character it was charisma being someone that cares for us you see he redefined the word champion to a category that the rest can t be in the unauthorized biography of muhammad ali epilogue the next seven years of his legendary boxing career were not without its price and in the early 80s he would go on to develop parkinsons disease presumably due to all of the punishment he had endured but that didn t stop ali from what he called his true life calling in humanitarian endeavours travelling around the world as the goodwill ambassador to us all the end next chapter martin luther king jr and barack

my heart is drawn to the small out of the way things that i can t help but to give my focus and attention and care cause they shut off what hijacks my brain and help to tune out what can cause me pain and i care for the animals around my yard and my sister s children and i care for my garden swarmed upon by bumblebees and yellow jackets and wasps and hornets that can dart out and sting i see the big orange tabby cat getting warm on the cover of the hot tub he turns over on his back looking for a belly rub i see the deer tracks in the snow on the animal path that leads into my backyard i hear the sound of my girlfriend s car coming up the driveway and it fills my heart with joy though i know it will all end someday and someone else will be sleeping in my mountain house wondering who lived here before just like i sometimes do though i never really cared to explore i see the chocolate and peanut butter cat i look at him and he looks back i snap my fingers and blow him a kiss he rubs his head against my hand and we reminisce i walk downtown and see the christmas lights along the highway and how they shine and i m reminded of when i was a child and how happy i felt when i opened the box and saw a guitar inside was on a flight to somewhere i can t remember i feel like i ve lived so many lives i can t put it all together dordrecht holland yeah that was it i had a nice dinner with a

polish restaurant down the street i played the next night at shepherd s bush empire neil halstead and his band were opening and their soundcheck sounded great and as i watched i remembered playing with mojave 3 in the mid 90s one of the shows being at cmj in new york and i remembered seeing them open for gomez in madrid in 1998 i was with my girlfriend marina but i somehow managed to sneak in an unforgettable kiss with rachel backstage it was one of those kisses that you ll take to your grave gomez knew i was there and they played grace cathedral park that night and i got pretty choked up listening to them so anyhow i played my show at shepherd s bush that night and a fan heckled me asking if i really hated nels cline i explained that i didn t that his name just rhymed with one word or the other after the show i left with my agent ed and his wife and alessia and we talked for a bit then i walked back to the k west with my guitar and got into my bed called my girlfriend and fell

got one breath then you could still see the light i m pulling over on the bridge i see a kid the look in his eyes says i don t wanna live then i hop out of the whip and i walk through the traffic he says i can t do it and then i looked right at him i told him  now s not too late to start fresh today so i could stop living a lie and i could start living alive now s not too late to start fresh today so i could stop living a lie and i could start living alive look back at the path are there puddles of blood and lakes of tears in the tracks is there darkened perspiration in the nook of your arm if not i expect to see a look of alarm because you haven t been tryin you ve been maxin n slackin you ve been roastin n coastin you ve been chillin buildin sandcastles next to the ocean man the seas are risin i see a diseased horizon you re gonna be ghost up in that moat if we don t see you flyin everything is swell up in your cerebellum you make so many excuses that it s too bad you can t sell em you roll out like a dice game when the fight came opportunities missed like a light rain you worry bout the future while you live in the past i know it s lonely at the top plus the middle is packed so what i like to do is trudge from the morning till the night is through in my hikin boots and they grip and grind and they slip and slide but every day my height is new i m telling you now s not too late to start fresh today so i could stop living a lie and i could start living alive now s not too late to start fresh today so i could stop living a lie and i could start living

i m climbing up every inch on a ladder reaching my prime i m finding inspiration in dimes that i ve been chasing not the ones with titties i m talking coins with silver faces i might go inside the matrix dodge your bullets fighting angels and it s all because of a pill and i wasn t afraid to take it i m skilled beyond the basics my meal ticket is real if you feel it then play it my rhyme scheme is one in a mill i m building a dynasty and making diamonds in my hands like jigga fans so ain t no denying me i ve been eyeballing the pioneers trying to hear what they re saying in my ear while i m still looking forward to where i steer i bet a deal would try to veer me off my path but i laugh at my adversaries while riding over the grass my past wasn t extravagant from traveling to different homes wishing that i had a family to call my own i m holding in all my thoughts while i got my mother on hold scared to ask her about the things that she dodged and never told she s getting a little older and moving a little slower but the future s looking bright and i promised her i would show her the diamond though on my shoulder is bigger than any chips so just know that i hold you down much tighter than any grip there ain t a bitch that could ever come between us i give em penis like a pendulum i swing at the sun and then right back to venus the meanest on any beat but i m always looking the cleanest even at 4 feet i m nothing short of a genius seeing all of the possibilities i conclude that the option of being obsolete is what i refuse i make music til i m decrepit and use it like an infection i m lupus with any weapon my fuse will blow any second and boom there goes my head again someone pass me a sediment fuck it i m all out so i m using you as my medicine cause therapy is scared of me gave them my information now they cause they never met a patient to compare to me my father is a criminal my mother s on crack but god got me he never let it take me off track my family s been separated we barely talk on the phone and i became an only child i never felt so alone but i smile cause through all of this i mma make something out of my situation and i ain t afraid of nothing no bluffing to fake you and no discussion of limitations debating i m fucking tired of waiting i ruined my best relationship messing with other girls all i gave her was heartbreak when i shoulda gave her the world and now my heart aches when i see us with other people my girl could tell me she love me i know we ll never be equal the people i surround myself with are my heart and i would pour it out for them if they were thirsty or parched i almost tore it out when i heard she was living with ace so in the back of my mind i m steady counting the days i m amazed how i ve been keeping my composure when i m sober opening up my life when i should be looking for closure i wish that i could open up a knife to cut my soul out to give it to y all to walk in my shoes without the game is closing i ll be a heater for when it s cold out just waiting on the day i ll be praying that i can hold out the book of my life the worst chapter s bout to close out my brain throw out finally got to open up thank you for the permission you don t like it i ain t mad i m just glad you gave it a listen to a nigga who raps for the lack of better descriptions just tryna play a position like that i was born with a porn mustache and an order to fuck the world up more than a mormon orgy with ornaments made to make a third wife horny i m in my third life my father swung his third strike and it landed him in the pen without a high five or a handshake i pray his brain escapes to be found on a landscape where his ground is worshipped his cape and his crown is purchased with love digesting every sentiment like m m s out of peanuts it s evident that he s nuts brain spilling but who they gon call for the cleanup i m just waiting on my beam up like the enterprise is a metaphor for heaven and scotty was a reverend from the old testament testing the men asking em questions about lazarus passing the answers back on to the master i m like zero but more nappy i m more happy than i ve ever been my hesitance was the reason i settled into this residence of evil but ain t no zombie killing my hobby it s catching i m probably in your lobby up on the cypher catching a body or doing an ollie a flip trick my whole squad is full of misfits i hope god is feeling this shit cause the devil got his foot on the pedal right hand on the stick shift wood grain like gipetto tryna meddle like fred no limp bizkit or scooby doo you couldn t shag me if i was austin my power s awesome put my against yours it ll dent yours i m flossing such a young man with an old soul i made a couple fans off of a
