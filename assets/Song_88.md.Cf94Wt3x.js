she was fifteen and she had a quick nervous giggling habit of craning her neck to glance into mirrors or checking other people s faces to make sure her own was all right her mother who noticed everything and knew everything and who hadn t much reason any longer to look at her own face always scolded connie about it stop gawking at yourself who are you you think you re so pretty she would say connie would raise her eyebrows at these familiar old complaints and look right through her mother into a shadowy vision of herself as she was right at that moment she knew she was pretty and that was everything her mother had been pretty once too if you could believe those old snapshots in the album but now her looks were gone and that was why she was always after connie why don t you keep your room clean like your sister how ve you got your hair fixedwhat the hell stinks hair spray you don t see your sister using that junk her sister june was twenty four and still lived at home she was a secretary in the high school connie attended and if that wasn t bad enoughwith her in the same buildingshe was so plain and chunky and steady that connie had to hear her praised all the time by her mother and her mother s sisters june did this june did that she saved money and helped clean the house and cookedand connie couldn t do a thing her mind was all filled with trashy daydreams their father was away at work most of the time and when he came home he wanted supper and he read the newspaper at supper and after supper he went to bed he didn t bother talking much to them but around his bent head connie s mother kept picking at her until connie wished her mother was dead and she herself was dead and it was all over she makes me want to throw up sometimes she complained to her friends she had a high breathless amused voice that made everything she said sound a little forced whether it was sincere or not there was one good thing june went places with girl friends of hers girls who were just as plain and steady as she and so when connie wanted to do that her mother had no objections the father of connie s best girl friend drove the girls the three miles to town and left them at a shopping plaza so they could walk through the stores or go to a movie and when he came to pick them up again at eleven he never bothered to ask what they had done they must have been familiar sights walking around the shopping plaza in their shorts and flat ballerina slippers that always scuffed the sidewalk with charm bracelets jingling on their thin wrists they would lean together to whisper and laugh secretly if someone passed who amused or interested them connie had long dark blond hair that drew anyone s eye to it and she wore part of it pulled up on her head and puffed out and the rest of it she let fall down her back she wore a pull over jersey blouse that looked one way when she was at home and another way when she was away from home everything about her had two sides to it one for home and one for anywhere that was not home her walk which could be childlike and bobbing or languid enough to make anyone think she was hearing music in her head her mouth which was pale and smirking most of the time but bright and pink on these evenings out her laugh which was cynical and drawling at home ha ha very funny but highpitched and nervous anywhere else like the jingling of the charms on her bracelet sometimes they did go shopping or to a movie but sometimes they went across the highway ducking fast across the busy road to a drive in restaurant where older kids hung out the restaurant was shaped like a big bottle though squatter than a real bottle and on its cap was a revolving figure of a grinning boy holding a hamburger aloft one night in midsummer they ran across breathless with daring and right away someone leaned out a car window and invited them over but it was just a boy from high school they didn t like it made them feel good to be able to ignore him they went up through the maze of parked and cruising cars to the bright lit fly infested restaurant their faces pleased and expectant as if they were entering a sacred building that loomed up out of the night to give them what haven and blessing they yearned for they sat at the counter and crossed their legs at the ankles their thin shoulders rigid with excitement and listened to the music that made everything so good the music was always in the background like music at a church service it was something to depend upon a boy named eddie came in to talk with them he sat backwards on his stool turning himself jerkily around in semicircles and then stopping and turning back again and after a while he asked connie if she would like something to eat she said she would and so she tapped her friend s arm on her way outher friend pulled her face up into a brave droll lookand connie said she would meet her at eleven across the way i just hate to leave her like that connie said earnestly but the boy said that she wouldn t be alone for long so they went out to his car and on the way connie couldn t help but let her eyes wander over the windshields and faces all around her her face gleaming with a joy that had nothing to do with eddie or even this place it might have been the music she drew her shoulders up and sucked in her breath with the pure pleasure of being alive and just at that moment she happened to glance at a face just a few feet from hers it was a boy with shaggy black hair in a convertible jalopy painted gold he stared at her and then his lips widened into a grin connie slit her eyes at him and turned away but she couldn t help glancing back and there he was still watching her he wagged a finger and laughed and said gonna get you baby and connie turned away again without eddie noticing anything she spent three hours with him at the restaurant where they ate hamburgers and drank cokes in wax cups that were always sweating and then down an alley a mile or so away and when he left her off at five to eleven only the movie house was still open at the plaza her girl friend was there talking with a boy when connie came up the two girls smiled at each other and connie said how was the movie and the girl said you should know they rode off with the girl s father sleepy and pleased and connie couldn t help but look back at the darkened shopping plaza with its big empty parking lot and its signs that were faded and ghostly now and over at the drive in restaurant where cars were still circling tirelessly she couldn t hear the music at this distance next morning june asked her how the movie was and connie said so so she and that girl and occasionally another girl went out several times a week and the rest of the time connie spent around the houseit was summer vacationgetting in her mother s way and thinking dreaming about the boys she met but all the boys fell back and dissolved into a single face that was not even a face but an idea a feeling mixed up with the urgent insistent pounding of the music and the humid night air of july connie s mother kept dragging her back to the daylight by finding things for her to do or saying suddenly what s this about the pettinger girl and connie would say nervously oh her that dope she always drew thick clear lines between herself and such girls and her mother was simple and kind enough to believe it her mother was so simple connie thought that it was maybe cruel to fool her so much her mother went scuffling around the house in old bedroom slippers and complained over the telephone to one sister about the other then the other called up and the two of them complained about the third one if june s name was mentioned her mother s tone was approving and if connie s name was mentioned it was disapproving this did not really mean she disliked connie and actually connie thought that her mother preferred her to june just because she was prettier but the two of them kept up a pretense of exasperation a sense that they were tugging and struggling over something of little value to either of them sometimes over coffee they were almost friends but something would come upsome vexation that was like a fly buzzing suddenly around their headsand their faces went hard with contempt one sunday connie got up at elevennone of them bothered with churchand washed her hair so that it could dry all day long in the sun her parents and sister were going to a barbecue at an aunt s house and connie said no she wasn t interested rolling her eyes to let her mother know just what she thought of it stay home alone then her mother said sharply connie sat out back in a lawn chair and watched them drive away her father quiet and bald hunched around so that he could back the car out her mother with a look that was still angry and not at all softened through the windshield and in the back seat poor old june all dressed up as if she didn t know what a barbecue was with all the running yelling kids and the flies connie sat with her eyes closed in the sun dreaming and dazed with the warmth about her as if this were a kind of love the caresses of love and her mind slipped over onto thoughts of the boy she had been with the night before and how nice he had been how sweet it always was not the way someone like june would suppose but sweet gentle the way it was in movies and promised in songs and when she opened her eyes she hardly knew where she was the back yard ran off into weeds and a fence like line of trees and behind it the sky was perfectly blue and still the asbestos ranch house that was now three years old startled herit looked small she shook her head as if to get awake it was too hot she went inside the house and turned on the radio to drown out the quiet she sat on the edge of her bed barefoot and listened for an hour and a half to a program called xyz sunday jamboree record after record of hard fast shrieking songs she sang along with interspersed by exclamations from bobby king an look here you girls at napoleon sson and charley want you to pay real close attention to this song coming up and connie paid close attention herself bathed in a glow of slow pulsed joy that seemed to rise mysteriously out of the music itself and lay languidly about the airless little room breathed in and breathed out with each gentle rise and fall of her chest after a while she heard a car coming up the drive she sat up at once startled because it couldn t be her father so soon the gravel kept crunching all the way in from the roadthe driveway was longand connie ran to the window it was a car she didn t know it was an open jalopy painted a bright gold that caught the sunlight opaquely her heart began to pound and her fingers snatched at her hair checking it and she whispered christ christ wondering how bad she looked the car came to a stop at the side door and the horn sounded four short taps as if this were a signal connie knew she went into the kitchen and approached the door slowly then hung out the screen door her bare toes curling down off the step there were two boys in the car and now she recognized the driver he had shaggy shabby black hair that looked crazy as a wig and he was grinning at her i ain t late am i he said who the hell do you think you are connie said toldja i d be out didn t i i don t even know who you are she spoke sullenly careful to show no interest or pleasure and he spoke in a fast bright monotone connie looked past him to the other boy taking her time he had fair brown hair with a lock that fell onto his forehead his sideburns gave him a fierce embarrassed look but so far he hadn t even bothered to glance at her both boys wore sunglasses the driver s glasses were metallic and mirrored everything in miniature you wanta come for a ride he said connie smirked and let her hair fall loose over one shoulder don tcha like my car new paint job he said hey what you re cute she pretended to fidget chasing flies away from the door don tcha believe me or what he said look i don t even know who you are connie said in disgust hey ellie s got a radio see mine broke down he lifted his friend s arm and showed her the little transistor radio the boy was holding and now connie began to hear the music it was the same program that was playing inside the house bobby king she said i listen to him all the time i think he s great he s kind of great connie said reluctantly listen that guy s great he knows where the action is connie blushed a little because the glasses made it impossible for her to see just what this boy was looking at she couldn t decide if she liked him or if he was just a jerk and so she dawdled in the doorway and wouldn t come down or go back inside she said what s all that stuff painted on your car can tcha read it he opened the door very carefully as if he were afraid it might fall off he slid out just as carefully planting his feet firmly on the ground the tiny metallic world in his glasses slowing down like gelatine hardening and in the midst of it connie s bright green blouse this here is my name to begin with he said arnold friend was written in tarlike black letters on the side with a drawing of a round grinning face that reminded connie of a pumpkin except it wore sunglasses i wanta introduce myself i m arnold friend and that s my real name and i m gonna be your friend honey and inside the car s ellie oscar he s kinda shy ellie brought his transistor radio up to his shoulder and balanced it there now these numbers are a secret code honey arnold friend explained he read off the numbers 33 19 17 and raised his eyebrows at her to see what she thought of that but she didn t think much of it the left rear fender had been smashed and around it was written on the gleaming gold background done by crazy woman driver connie had to laugh at that arnold friend was pleased at her laughter and looked up at her around the other side s a lot more you wanta come and see them no why not why should i don tcha wanta see what s on the car don tcha wanta go for a ride i don t know why not i got things to do like what things he laughed as if she had said something funny he slapped his thighs he was standing in a strange way leaning back against the car as if he were balancing himself he wasn t tall only an inch or so taller than she would be if she came down to him connie liked the way he was dressed which was the way all of them dressed tight faded jeans stuffed into black scuffed boots a belt that pulled his waist in and showed how lean he was and a white pull over shirt that was a little soiled and showed the hard small muscles of his arms and shoulders he looked as if he probably did hard work lifting and carrying things even his neck looked muscular and his face was a familiar face somehow the jaw and chin and cheeks slightly darkened because he hadn t shaved for a day or two and the nose long and hawklike sniffing as if she were a treat he was going to gobble up and it was all a joke connie you ain t telling the truth this is your day set aside for a ride with me and you know it he said still laughing the way he straightened and recovered from his fit of laughing showed that it had been all fake how do you know what my name is she said suspiciously it s connie maybe and maybe not i know my connie he said wagging his finger now she remembered him even better back at the restaurant and her cheeks warmed at the thought of how she had sucked in her breath just at the moment she passed himhow she must have looked to him and he had remembered her ellie and i come out here especially for you he said ellie can sit in back how about it where where what where re we going he looked at her he took off the sunglasses and she saw how pale the skin around his eyes was like holes that were not in shadow but instead in light his eyes were like chips of broken glass that catch the light in an amiable way he smiled it was as if the idea of going for a ride somewhere to someplace was a new idea to him just for a ride connie sweetheart i never said my name was connie she said but i know what it is i know your name and all about you lots of things arnold friend said he had not moved yet but stood still leaning back against the side of his jalopy i took a special interest in you such a pretty girl and found out all about youlike i know your parents and sister are gone somewheres and i know where and how long they re going to be gone and i know who you were with last night and your best girl friend s name is betty right he spoke in a simple lilting voice exactly as if he were reciting the words to a song his smile assured her that everything was fine in the car ellie turned up the volume on his radio and did not bother to look around at them ellie can sit in the back seat arnold friend said he indicated his friend with a casual jerk of his chin as if ellie did not count and she should not bother with him how d you find out all that stuff connie said listen betty schultz and tony fitch and jimmy pettinger and nancy pettinger he said in a chant raymond stanley and bob hutter do you know all those kids i know everybody look you re kidding you re not from around here sure buthow come we never saw you before sure you saw me before he said he looked down at his boots as if he were a little offended you just don t remember i guess i d remember you connie said yeah he looked up at this beaming he was pleased he began to mark time with the music from ellie s radio tapping his fists lightly together connie looked away from his smile to the car which was painted so bright it almost hurt her eyes to look at it she looked at that name arnold friend and up at the front fender was an expression that was familiarman the flying saucers it was an expression kids had used the year before but didn t use this year she looked at it for a while as if the words meant something to her that she did not yet know what re you thinking about huh arnold friend demanded not worried about your hair blowing around in the car are you no think i maybe can t drive good how do i know you re a hard girl to handle how come he said don t you know i m your friend didn t you see me put my sign in the air when you walked by what sign my sign and he drew an x in the air leaning out toward her they were maybe ten feet apart after his hand fell back to his side the x was still in the air almost visible connie let the screen door close and stood perfectly still inside it listening to the music from her radio and the boy s blend together she stared at arnold friend he stood there so stiffly relaxed pretending to be relaxed with one hand idly on the door handle as if he were keeping himself up that way and had no intention of ever moving again she recognized most things about him the tight jeans that showed his thighs and buttocks and the greasy leather boots and the tight shirt and even that slippery friendly smile of his that sleepy dreamy smile that all the boys used to get across ideas they didn t want to put into words she recognized all this and also the singsong way he talked slightly mocking kidding but serious and a little melancholy and she recognized the way he tapped one fist against the other in homage to the perpetual music behind him but all these things did not come together she said suddenly hey how old are you his smiled faded she could see then that he wasn t a kid he was much olderthirty maybe more at this knowledge her heart began to pound faster that s a crazy thing to ask can tcha see i m your own age like hell you are or maybe a couple years older i m eighteen eighteen she said doubtfully he grinned to reassure her and lines appeared at the corners of his mouth his teeth were big and white he grinned so broadly his eyes became slits and she saw how thick the lashes were thick and black as if painted with a black tarlike material then abruptly he seemed to become embarrassed and looked over his shoulder at ellie him he s crazy he said ain t he a riot he s a nut a real character ellie was still listening to the music his sunglasses told nothing about what he was thinking he wore a bright orange shirt unbuttoned halfway to show his chest which was a pale bluish chest and not muscular like arnold friend s his shirt collar was turned up all around and the very tips of the collar pointed out past his chin as if they were protecting him he was pressing the transistor radio up against his ear and sat there in a kind of daze right in the sun he s kinda strange connie said hey she says you re kinda strange kinda strange arnold friend cried he pounded on the car to get ellie s attention ellie turned for the first time and connie saw with shock that he wasn t a kid eitherhe had a fair hairless face cheeks reddened slightly as if the veins grew too close to the surface of his skin the face of a forty year old baby connie felt a wave of dizziness rise in her at this sight and she stared at him as if waiting for something to change the shock of the moment make it all right again ellie s lips kept shaping words mumbling along with the words blasting in his ear maybe you two better go away connie said faintly what how come arnold friend cried we come out here to take you for a ride it s sunday he had the voice of the man on the radio now it was the same voice connie thought don tcha know it s sunday all day and honey no matter who you were with last night today you re with arnold friend and don t you forget it maybe you better step out here he said and this last was in a different voice it was a little flatter as if the heat was finally getting to him no i got things to do hey you two better leave we ain t leaving until you come with us like hell i am connie don t fool around with me i meani mean don t fool around he said shaking his head he laughed incredulously he placed his sunglasses on top of his head carefully as if he were indeed wearing a wig and brought the stems down behind his ears connie stared at him another wave of dizziness and fear rising in her so that for a moment he wasn t even in focus but was just a blur standing there against his gold car and she had the idea that he had driven up the driveway all right but had come from nowhere before that and belonged nowhere and that everything about him and even about the music that was so familiar to her was only half real if my father comes and sees you he ain t coming he s at a barbecue how do you know that aunt tillie s right now they re uhthey re drinking sitting around he said vaguely squinting as if he were staring all the way to town and over to aunt tillie s back yard then the vision seemed to get clear and he nodded energetically yeah sitting around there s your sister in a blue dress huh and high heels the poor sad bitchnothing like you sweetheart and your mother s helping some fat woman with the corn they re cleaning the cornhusking the corn what fat woman connie cried how do i know what fat woman i don t know every goddamn fat woman in the world arnold friend laughed oh that s mrs hornsby who invited her connie said she felt a little lightheaded her breath was coming quickly she s too fat i don t like them fat i like them the way you are honey he said smiling sleepily at her they stared at each other for a while through the screen door he said softly now what you re going to do is this you re going to come out that door you re going to sit up front with me and ellie s going to sit in the back the hell with ellie right this isn t ellie s date you re my date i m your lover honey what you re crazy yes i m your lover you don t know what that is but you will he said i know that too i know all about you but look it s real nice and you couldn t ask for nobody better than me or more polite i always keep my word i ll tell you how it is i m always nice at first the first time i ll hold you so tight you won t think you have to try to get away or pretend anything because you ll know you can t and i ll come inside you where it s all secret and you ll give in to me and you ll love me shut up you re crazy connie said she backed away from the door she put her hands up against her ears as if she d heard something terrible something not meant for her people don t talk like that you re crazy she muttered her heart was almost too big now for her chest and its pumping made sweat break out all over her she looked out to see arnold friend pause and then take a step toward the porch lurching he almost fell but like a clever drunken man he managed to catch his balance he wobbled in his high boots and grabbed hold of one of the porch posts honey he said you still listening get the hell out of here be nice honey listen i m going to call the police he wobbled again and out of the side of his mouth came a fast spat curse an aside not meant for her to hear but even this christ sounded forced then he began to smile again she watched this smile come awkward as if he were smiling from inside a mask his whole face was a mask she thought wildly tanned down to his throat but then running out as if he had plastered make up on his face but had forgotten about his throat honey listen here s how it is i always tell the truth and i promise you this i ain t coming in that house after you you better not i m going to call the police if youif you don t honey he said talking right through her voice honey i m not coming in there but you are coming out here you know why she was panting the kitchen looked like a place she had never seen before some room she had run inside but that wasn t good enough wasn t going to help her the kitchen window had never had a curtain after three years and there were dishes in the sink for her to doprobablyand if you ran your hand across the table you d probably feel something sticky there you listening honey hey going to call the police soon as you touch the phone i don t need to keep my promise and can come inside you won t want that she rushed forward and tried to lock the door her fingers were shaking but why lock it arnold friend said gently talking right into her face it s just a screen door it s just nothing one of his boots was at a strange angle as if his foot wasn t in it it pointed out to the left bent at the ankle i mean anybody can break through a screen door and glass and wood and iron or anything else if he needs to anybody at all and specially arnold friend if the place got lit up with a fire honey you d come runnin out into my arms right into my arms an safe at homelike you knew i was your lover and d stopped fooling around i don t mind a nice shy girl but i don t like no fooling around part of those words were spoken with a slight rhythmic lilt and connie somehow recognized themthe echo of a song from last year about a girl rushing into her boy friend s arms and coming home again connie stood barefoot on the linoleum floor staring at him what do you want she whispered i want you he said what seen you that night and thought that s the one yes sir i never needed to look anymore but my father s coming back he s coming to get me i had to wash my hair first she spoke in a dry rapid voice hardly raising it for him to hear no your daddy is not coming and yes you had to wash your hair and you washed it for me it s nice and shining and all for me i thank you sweetheart he said with a mock bow but again he almost lost his balance he had to bend and adjust his boots evidently his feet did not go all the way down the boots must have been stuffed with something so that he would seem taller connie stared out at him and behind him at ellie in the car who seemed to be looking off toward connie s right into nothing this ellie said pulling the words out of the air one after another as if he were just discovering them you want me to pull out the phone shut your mouth and keep it shut arnold friend said his face red from bending over or maybe from embarrassment because connie had seen his boots this ain t none of your business whatwhat are you doing what do you want connie said if i call the police they ll get you they ll arrest you promise was not to come in unless you touch that phone and i ll keep that promise he said he resumed his erect position and tried to force his shoulders back he sounded like a hero in a movie declaring something important but he spoke too loudly and it was as if he were speaking to someone behind connie i ain t made plans for coming in that house where i don t belong but just for you to come out to me the way you should don t you know who i am you re crazy she whispered she backed away from the door but did not want to go into another part of the house as if this would give him permission to come through the door what do you you re crazy you huh what re you saying honey her eyes darted everywhere in the kitchen she could not remember what it was this room this is how it is honey you come out and we ll drive away have a nice ride but if you don t come out we re gonna wait till your people come home and then they re all going to get it you want that telephone pulled out ellie said he held the radio away from his ear and grimaced as if without the radio the air was too much for him i toldja shut up ellie arnold friend said you re deaf get a hearing aid right fix yourself up this little girl s no trouble and s gonna be nice to me so ellie keep to yourself this ain t your date right don t hem in on me don t hog don t crush don t bird dog don t trail me he said in a rapid meaningless voice as if he were running through all the expressions he d learned but was no longer sure which of them was in style then rushing on to new ones making them up with his eyes closed don t crawl under my fence don t squeeze in my chipmonk hole don t sniff my glue suck my popsicle keep your own greasy fingers on yourself he shaded his eyes and peered in at connie who was backed against the kitchen table don t mind him honey he s just a creep he s a dope right i m the boy for you and like i said you come out here nice like a lady and give me your hand and nobody else gets hurt i mean your nice old bald headed daddy and your mummy and your sister in her high heels because listen why bring them in this leave me alone connie whispered hey you know that old woman down the road the one with the chickens and stuffyou know her she s dead dead what you know her arnold friend said she s dead don t you like her she s deadshe sshe isn t here any more but don t you like her i mean you got something against her some grudge or something then his voice dipped as if he were conscious of a rudeness he touched the sunglasses perched up on top of his head as if to make sure they were still there now you be a good girl what are you going to do just two things or maybe three arnold friend said but i promise it won t last long and you ll like me the way you get to like people you re close to you will it s all over for you here so come on out you don t want your people in any trouble do you she turned and bumped against a chair or something hurting her leg but she ran into the back room and picked up the telephone something roared in her ear a tiny roaring and she was so sick with fear that she could do nothing but listen to itthe telephone was clammy and very heavy and her fingers groped down to the dial but were too weak to touch it she began to scream into the phone into the roaring she cried out she cried for her mother she felt her breath start jerking back and forth in her lungs as if it were something arnold friend was stabbing her with again and again with no tenderness a noisy sorrowful wailing rose all about her and she was locked inside it the way she was locked inside this house after a while she could hear again she was sitting on the floor with her wet back against the wall arnold friend was saying from the door that s a good girl put the phone back she kicked the phone away from her no honey pick it up put it back right she picked it up and put it back the dial tone stopped that s a good girl now you come outside she was hollow with what had been fear but what was now just an emptiness all that screaming had blasted it out of her she sat one leg cramped under her and deep inside her brain was something like a pinpoint of light that kept going and would not let her relax she thought i m not going to see my mother again she thought i m not going to sleep in my bed again her bright green blouse was all wet arnold friend said in a gentle loud voice that was like a stage voice the place where you came from ain t there any more and where you had in mind to go is cancelled out this place you are nowinside your daddy s houseis nothing but a cardboard box i can knock down any time you know that and always did know it you hear me she thought i have got to think i have got to know what to do we ll go out to a nice field out in the country here where it smells so nice and it s sunny arnold friend said i ll have my arms tight around you so you won t need to try to get away and i ll show you what love is like what it does the hell with this house it looks solid all right he said he ran a fingernail down the screen and the noise did not make connie shiver as it would have the day before now put your hand on your heart honey feel that that feels solid too but we know better be nice to me be sweet like you can because what else is there for a girl like you but to be sweet and pretty and give in and get away before her people come back she felt her pounding heart her hand seemed to enclose it she thought for the first time in her life that it was nothing that was hers that belonged to her but just a pounding living thing inside this body that wasn t really hers either you don t want them to get hurt arnold friend went on now get up honey get up all by yourself she stood now turn this way that s right come over here to me ellie put that away didn t i tell you you dope you miserable creepy dope arnold friend said his words were not angry but only part of an incantation the incantation was kindly now come out through the kitchen to me honey and let s see a smile try it you re a brave sweet little girl and now they re eating corn and hot dogs cooked to bursting over an outdoor fire and they don t know one thing about you and never did and honey you re better than them because not a one of them would have done this for you connie felt the linoleum under her feet it was cool she brushed her hair back out of her eyes arnold friend let go of the post tentatively and opened his arms for her his elbows pointing in toward each other and his wrists limp to show that this was an embarrassed embrace and a little mocking he didn t want to make her self conscious she put out her hand against the screen she watched herself push the door slowly open as if she were back safe somewhere in the other doorway watching this body and this head of long hair moving out into the sunlight where arnold friend waited my sweet little blue eyed girl he said in a half sung sigh that had nothing to do with her brown eyes but was taken up just the same by the vast sunlit reaches of the land behind him and on all sides of himso much land that connie had never seen before and did not recognize except to know that she was going to it","is_english":"True","genres_list":"['Unknown

noon i am glad you asked imaginary other half of this conversation i have no idea some characteristics of bipolar disorder include dissociation hallucinations and fugue states so sometimes i wake up in places i didn t go to sleep so there i am nude splayed out on a car like a slutty chicken and i m screaming about the government conspiracy to take away my feet not my real feet just my brain feet i m about six inches away from the concrete when i realize in slow motion like the exact opposite of a rhinoceros attack this is not how i imagined my life would turn out when i was young i broke both my ankles jumping off a roof because i was sure a cape would enable me to fly my parents attributed this to my strong imagination last year my therapist called it a delusion i fail to see the difference also i really can fly and see the future and make stupid people leave coffee shops with my mind forty three percent of the time sometimes i see people as colors for instance this guy right here is purple which means he just got a promotion or a blowjob a blowmotion if you will the point is here is a list of things my brain has told me to do join a cult start a cult become a cabinet maker kill myself so in essence become a cabinet maker break into and then paint other people s houses have sex with literally everyone who reminds me of my mother fight people who are much fightier than me like the cops so in essence kill myself i think a lot about killing myself not like a point on a map but rather like a glowing exit sign at a show that s never been quite bad enough to make me want to leave see when i m up i don t kill myself because holy shit there s so much left to do when i m down i don t kill myself because then the sadness would be over and the sadness is my old paint under the new the sadness is the house fire or the broken shoulder i d still be me without it but i d be so boring they keep telling me seeing things that aren t technically there is called disturbed cognitive functioning i call it having a superpower once i pulled over on the 110 freeway and jumped out of my old jeep because i saw it burst into flames twenty seconds before it actually burst into flames i knew my girlfriend and i would be together because she turned bright pink the first time she saw me i know tomorrow is going to come because i ve seen it sunrise is going to come all you have to do is wake up the future has been at war but it s coming home so soon the future looks like a child in a cape the future is the map and the treasure the future looks just like gravity everyone is slowly drifting toward everyone else we are all going to be part of each other one day the future is a blue sky and a full tank of gas i saw the future i did and in it i was alive

and scatter my poor home soon came the harsh day that forced me to roam well i reached bold philadelphia in the brave land of the free where i met with my two brothers there was pat james then me we were destined for the rich land fate owes us all from birth we were bound for butte montana the richest hill on earth where their pockets they bulge heavy when copper s running high where the hill rewards her brave sons it s fortune or die where they tread on silver dollars on the crowded barroom floor while they strip the granite mountain of her precious copper ore well we leaped down off that steam train and stepped out into the yellow mist with holes still in our hearts then and a fight in either fist no kind face to lead us up to where the dirty smelter spat and it s there i took to hard labor as a butte mining rat where we trade the hours of daylight for the smell of copper ore where it s whiskey and the cow pats to cure our copper sores where half the town it labors while the other half it sleeps where upon the granite mountain a mile high and deep oh they know me down in dogtown bare knuckle i would go for there s not a man could best me while standing toe to toe but i defied the crooked sheriff for i wouldn t throw his fight away he should have laid it on at 5 to 2 and backed the bold conway i was lifted in con peoples with the beer and music flowing free where my brothers had just left me oh bad fortune for me dragged out by crooked cowards their batons knocked me off my feet and they left me to die there like a dog in the street far from the anaconda the mine with seven stacks far from the ashen faces of young men with crooked backs far from the granite mountain and the dusty grave in which i lie my spirit chases starlings round a clear mayo

you cannot hide yes and as the oars of the sleek fierce viking ship cut thru the water like knives thru the fog shrouded nordic sea transporting the wild marauding band of viking heathens stealthily towards their unsuspecting slumbering victims there he stood on the foredeck erik the awful the wildest bloodthirstiest viking of them all he had a hairy head a hairy face hairy chest hairy legs hairy boots and a hairy hat shaped like a big bullet with horns comin out the sides and once he started after ya he d never stop he d turn to his oarsmen in his 37 oared fj ord and he d say morden borden

and goodness gracious his appetite for slaughter was simply voracious you gotta sleep with your sneakers by your side yes and when the villagers heard that awful battle cry ya hooooooooooo that s the one they would run for their lives fleeing over hills and thru valleys to the river whereupon they would walk mid stream for 37 and 1 2 miles climbing out on the low lying branch shinnying down a young sapling onto rocky ground and leaping from stone to stone until they arrived one week later at a secret cave 97 miles away and as they sat down for the first time to catch their breath outside they heard  ya hoooo morden borden fjorden gorden chorus yes it was erik the awful the brutal and tenacious erik the awful turned up in the darndest places subtle as a chainsaw lacking all the social

mediterranian sea to mon golia hooked up with a camel caravan into the heart of the gobi desert and as they paused at an oasis to lift one handful of cool water to their parched lips over their shoulder they heard ya hoooo morden borden fjorden gorden they fled to calcutta ya hoooooooo they fled to the himalayas ya hoooooooo tokyo ya hoooooooo toronto ya hoooooooo toledo and heyhailea georgia ya hoooooooo but it was no use they finally succumbed to a savage plundering and pillaging followed by a big hickey party on the outskirts of what is now washington dc where the decendants of erik can still be found today working as special agents for the irs erik later amassed a small fortune posing for molly hatchet album covers and did stuntwork for arnold schwartzenegger in conan the barbarian he also won an academy award for his dual role as a train wreck and his tender portrayal of king kong s daddy oh you might remember the end of that one there wasn t a dry eye in the house

this note to you to tell you of me plight for at the time of writing i am not a pretty sight me body is all black and blue me face a deathly grey and i write this note to tell you why i m not at work today while working on the fourteenth floor some bricks i had to clear but to toss them down from such a height was not a good idea the foreman wasn t very pleased he is an awkward sod he said i d have to cart them down the ladders in me hod now shifting all those bricks by hand it was so very slow so i hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below but in me haste to do the job i was too blind to see that a barrel full of building bricks is heavier than me and so when i untied the rope the barrel fell like lead and clinging tightly to the rope i started up instead i shot up like a rocket til to my dismay i found that halfway up i met the bloody barrel coming down now the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped and when i reached the top i banged the pulley with me head i clung on tightly numb with shock from this almighty blow and the barrel spilled out half the bricks fourteen floors below now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor i then outweighed the barrel and so started down once more still clinging tightly to the rope me body wracked with pain halfway down i met the bloody barrel once again now the force of this collision halfway down the office block caused multiple contusions and a nasty state of shock still clinging tightly to the rope i fell toward the ground and landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round well i lay there groaning on the ground i thought i d passed the worst but the barrel hit the pulley wheel and then the bottom burst a shower of bricks rained down on me i didn t have a hope for as i lay there bleeding i let go the bloody rope the barrel being unsecured then started down once more and it landed right across me as i lay there on the floor it broke three ribs and my left arm and i

will never cease yeah life s a glutton for its own self inflicted misery press the right button and see a million clones rendition of bigotry is it because i hit the dot on the bottom of my question

rarity in a world where we can see in three dimensions but so many fucking people are just one sided while some blinded by their faith in a system which has more cracks than a wiseguy the rest just shook viewing the coming attractions with wide eyes  while some view life in a luxury box suite i m stuck with nose bleed seats trying to see my future through binoculars not sure if it s success i see or just a recipe for self destruction with something sucking me towards the latter and as my dreams begin to shatter i mask my face focus on my task and question if it matters but this inner sadness is harder to contain than piss in bladders swimming against the current mainstream but damn this fish done missed his ladder so they slaughter me to sustain an energy efficient status

s become clear nope we were right the eastern conference as a whole is awful it appears to be a foregone conclusion that at least two of the playoff teams will be under 500 and it could be by as many as six games but conference alignment in the playoffs isn t going anywhere this year so this is where we re at and while the overall records might be bad the race for the 6th through 8th seeds has actually become pretty compelling even if few have any real hope of getting out of the first round making the playoffs even in the east is a mark of success in this league with 35 days to go before the start of the playoffs here s a look at the teams that are reasonably in and out of the playoff race in the east in barring a federal disaster milwaukee bucks milwaukee was cruising to the sixth seed with an outside chance at the fifth seed earlier this year but after losing jabari parker and then larry sanders the bucks made a long term goals over short term gain move and traded brandon knight who they didn t want to re sign in restricted free agency since the trade deadline they re 4 8 and are 29th in offensive efficiency so not great bob milwaukee s still got a tough defense but with michael carter williams at the forefront and with their lack of depth things are a lot tougher offensively the schedule is extremely unkind until april with games against the grizzlies pelicans spurs cavaliers warriors and hawks before the calendar flips but the april schedule is much softer with games against the celtics magic cavaliers knicks nets sixers and celtics again and given their competition even with a magic number of 14 as of saturday they likely only need another five to seven wins but with that march schedule stretch and given the way that the pacers are playing the bucks are looking more and more likely to wind up in the seventh seed facing the cavaliers that s a much less ideal matchup than the third seed and a possible raptors matchup and the raptors are getting the third seed their schedule for the remainder of the season is yogurt pushed through a cheese grader as for a playoff spot they re five up on the heat and celtics in the loss column boston s hot but there are enough easy wins to avoid a total collapse most likely finish 7th seed matchup with cleveland first round indiana pacers the hottest team in the land since the all star break 9 1 they ve been unstoppable and there s still the looming return of paul george they are extremely well coached they have a lot of hidden talent and their schedule is soft enough despite 10 of 17 remaining games against playoff teams indiana can play with anyone right now with milwaukee s brutal schedule through the end of march and with five of the pacers eight games left in march at home don t be surprised if indiana slides up to the sixth seed and holds on the pacers aren t necessarily scared of any of the seeds they have played lebron james before and while they haven t beaten him they have to feel confident in their chances to compete but a third seed matchup with toronto is something that should probably send shivers down the raptors spine a tough defensive team with slashing guards that can get to the rim that s bad news for wethenorth but the schedule is filled with tough teams for indiana as well and if milwaukee can find some footing their 3 5 game lead on indiana could hold on the other side the pacers magic number remains a sky high 17 but given momentum and schedule we re going to pencil in indiana for a move up the standings most likely finish 6th seed and a first round matchup with toronto on the bubble everyone else charlotte hornets the hornets have done enough and battled past a lot of adversity to get their stake on the 8th seed they got off to a terrible start have dealt with injuries to kemba walker and al jefferson and haven t ever really gotten lance stephenson acclimated nothing has really gone right for the hornets yet here they are in the 8th seed and on the surface their remaining schedule doesn t look too bad only 10 of their final 18 opponents are against playoff teams and only two against western conference playoff teams with so many lottery teams in their sights you should feel more confident in their ability to hold on but the problem is with who and where the other games are eleven of the hornets final 18 are on the road charlotte hasn t been much worse on the road than they ve been at home but that s still not favorable and their non playoff games are against the suddenly frisky jazz and timberwolves the red hot celtics and the heat who they re fighting with for the 8th they realistically have five games against basement teams charlotte has been inconsistent with their winning patterns but it s still not a favorable look given their resume and identity the bigger problem is boston but we ll get to that in a minute some good news charlotte has tiebreaker over every team in contention currently except indiana most likely finish uncertain but you can t pencil them in they re one of two teams with the best shot at the 8th and a first round matchup with atlanta miami heat miami the oklahoma city of the east in that every time something starts to break its way it gets a stroke of bad luck injuries weird losses the freak chris bosh condition and the fact that the heat simply haven t been able to field a consistent rotation michael beasley is playing center for crying out loud tyler johnson is helping them carry games who is tyler johnson and beyond all that i would have a lot more faith in them if it wasn t for the schedule and oh man the schedule good news the heat have nine of their final 17 games at home where they are 14 18 worse than on the road ok that s not good news but at least they only play 12 teams that are either in the playoffs or fighting for the eighth seed again not ideal but at least they don t have to play the cavaliers twice the bulls the raptors the thunder the hawks and the spurs oh wait yes they do starting monday miami plays cleveland portland okc milwaukee atlanta san antonio and cleveland again before april 2nd the only redeeming news for miami is that they finish with the magic and sixers but even then most of their competitors for the playoff spot will be facing either lottery teams or teams that will be resting starters having secured a spot no matter how well dwyane wade has played or the improvement goran dragic can bring with more time with his new team it s just hard to have any faith in a team needing big contributions from hassan whiteside and michael beasley to carry through that schedule did i mention they don t have a tiebreaker over any team except the celtics right now i believe in dwyane wade i believe in erik spoelstra but you just can t have faith in miami surviving a year that s been this tough likely to finish 10th if the heat manage to make the playoffs it s going to take either a collapse from their competitors or a phenomenal run by miami boston celtics what s a guy got to do to tank around here danny ainge traded rajon rondo has moved nearly every veteran except brandon bass lost jared sullinger to injury has more future second round picks than millions in salary tied up and yet i have a really strong feeling they re going to make the 8th on the surface boston s schedule isn t that much better than charlotte s they have 13 of their final 18 vs teams that are in the playoffs or in contention ten of boston s final 18 are on the road but look closer and it looks very doable first off they have games against the 76ers pistons nets knicks and a double set vs the cavaliers when cleveland will likely have secured their seed they only have two back to backs remaining with one on the final night of the season and beyond that they have a world of momentum with evan turner having stepped up his play with isaiah thomas on a team that gives him free reign to go nuts and with a revamped interior featuring tyler zeller brandon bass in a bigger role and jonas jerebko boston s playing the best basketball of their 8th seed competitors that s not saying much but they are 8 5 since the all star break the issue they ve ridden this wave of momentum to get here and now have to sustain it if they hit a lull as teams often do it could come at a very bad time they have to stay hot through april 15th to catch but bear in mind they re a game back right now likely finish most likely candidate to grab the 8th seed as it stands right now so long and thanks for all the fish brooklyn nets the nets were in it they looked like they d really turned a corner after losing a close one to the rockets and knocking off the mavericks and warriors and then five straight losses four at home including a dagger loss wednesday to the miami heat brooklyn is 3 5 back they have lost tiebreakers to boston and miami with games left vs the pacers milwaukee and charlotte fourteen of their final 19 games are against either playoff teams or teams in contention they have four easy games left orlando new york the lakers and the 76ers and more than all that they are a fountain of sadness they ve had injuries and bad luck as well but they ve also simply lost their fight they have no answers for what s happened to them and very little in the way of leadership to carry them brooklyn s tragic number is still 16 because the eastern conference is trash most likely finish thanks for playing please collect your draft pick on the way out the doo oh wait no that goes to the hawks detroit pistons if only brandon jennings hadn t got hurt they might have been in this thing but reggie jackson has been a disaster and the team s defense has fallen off a cliff detroit is 1 9 in their last ten 4 11 in their last 15 seven back in the loss column thirteen of the pistons 17 remaining games are against playoff teams or teams in contention for the 8th the bottom has dropped out they re done most likely finish their tragic number is still 12 but it s a formality detroit s toast","is_english":"True","genres_list":"['Unknown

waiting for someone or something to show you the way tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run you missed the starting gun and you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it s sinking racing around to come up behind you again the sun is the same in a relative way but you re older shorter of breath and one day closer to death every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time plans that either come to naught or half

christmas shit from last year they want more from life if it exists i guess were all looking forward to us shining a couple holidays from now well all be fine when we finally get a chance to walk along horizons or were bored of trying organized and 45 and tired we were shopping mall pilgrims outlaws at yard sales we wrote our names in ash and cigarettes on guardrails so if they do report me missing and my car bails i was 21 the day the engine in my heart failed someday i wanna leave the state move away and gone every wrinkle in my face says im aging wrong wake up in a diner playing 80s graduation songs and start to wonder if my generations days are lost orchestrate the horns tires hit the rain im driving singing prayers that i compiled on the way cause heavens just a car crash away from real life until then ill never know what paradise feels like yeah well everything gets old everything gets dusty everything gets cold until we do it all again without the interruptions and no longer can recognize the houses we grew up in yeah well everything gets old everything gets vintage everything lets go until tomorrow when we find a better way to end the century and suddenly we recognize the people that were meant to be as im driving down the interstate its 4 am im infinite wondering if i can make this last before it finishes is this great stillness all were really out to find is there a pot of gold at the end of the power lines we hopped fences over garage centers and hopelessly lost tenants of the parking lot perspective tired of broken hondas tires that blow up on us someday well grow up and be local rock legends who stopped pretending i dont wanna be that lost convinced my ticket out isn t a scratch off we found hope in a melody it was just a riff the song says theres more to life but its just a myth speeding past the gallery of lights lead me off into the blanket of the night because i would rather crash my car on purpose than grow up to be a person whos unhappy with an accidental life when everything gets old everything gets dusty everything gets cold well finally do it all again without the interruptions and well no longer recognize the houses

the tide love patience and time and it won t take long till it s gonna be alright love patience and time that power is strong in your heart and mine i knew a girl a pretty girl but her daddy never loved her she wondered why every guy left her out in the cold what daddy did she must forgive before her heart grows colder and all the love she s dreaming of maybe then she will know yeah we ve got stories and people to blame for our lives no don t get lost in that circle don t you know that s a lie the only way is to leave the past behind there s so much more inside you and me that the world needs to still believe nothing s too great for this god and me keep in mind love and life everything is gonna be alright  grab a gun everyone said the leader of many we ve got to kill to change the will of the other side some people swear that blood and fear will bring the world together i believe that all we need love patience and

life goes by so quickly take your mistakes for what they are it s the art of being human and learning to fall you re born to think for yourself but that s not good for them that s not what they want they want you to hate yourself and everyone around you so that your world can stay a crowded jail cell where the worst is always expected and the scraps are never good enough it only takes one stone to knock a king out cold you ve rested long enough i want to see you get back up see your path make it yours hold your head stop letting them break you cause there is a fire you can walk through so

all of these men trust me it fuckin hurts i put rusty shovels to dirt with my brothers it s been discussed their assassinations rehearsed but i can t do that cause then i d end up just like my father 22 years the cycle continues so why would i bother risk my career and throw away everything that i ve worked for some of things i ve seen i ve never dreamed that you could work towards i m trying to show her love but wish i could rehearse more she told me she would walk and i just opened up the front door what was the fun for playing round with a heart didn t stay around to maintain this relationship she was smart honestly she s better off with a partner who part the sea for her her heart is all he cares about do anything to be with her me i m lazer focused so my days of a hopeless romantic have been taken over this music is all i yearn for earning my keep with my sermons burning receipts for my servings purging my demons with verses i need some nurses who can patch me up i m tryna wipe my tears with scar tissue cause i ve been wounded my life was ruined by hard issues what s even harder was persevering through all it some people spend their life with nothing but fear in their wallets but now i m stepping out my shell no need for all the skeletons collecting dust on shelves i m next to bust down the doors no need to ring the bell and i ve been on this route before so easy we can t fail no need to be italian we already know it s

you re a friend of mine i love you in a place where there s no space and time i love you for my life cause you re a friend of mine have you ever been betrayed that shit s the worst hit of pain when somebody you loved can t look you in your face and have you ever had your heart torn out by somebody you thought was your friend and now your trust is worn down or bought to an end no pardons can mend it when you re darkened within fuck cause effect it s a hard fate to take and your reasons don t soften the sin your dogs can bark for you but you gotta watch when you argue cause dogs will bite and snarl at you just to remind you that they re harmful i feel awful i m a mental case shattered to pieces and i ve got a palm full past law school and beyond consul cause you ve crossed the bar with me farther than i ve ever thought possible my choice is now mandatory and not optional don t ever speak another sentence to me ever mention me i don t exist convince yourself you invented me you ve committed the crime of the century and just cause loyalty ain t a trait you possess don t think that i ll lessen the penalty what s your name again i know i knew it 2 seconds ago but i don t recognize this second face though to the first it s identical you were the type that i put on a pedestal your acts were commendable but the bond of friendship isn t impenetrable and inevitably the blunt force of ego proved lethal to a good person forced to wallow in the shit of evil people fundamentally filled with avarice a cheat from the soul spending their lives to make sure that you ain t achieving your goals unreasonable kings that want to see you jump through rings of fire for their own amusement holding nooses hoping trees are higher so abusive towards you that truce just doesn t seem required cause why play the game when you can make the other team retire strings are tirelessly pulled in your favour as you play the rumor creator twisting words til they sound like statements you made up with a big grin you soak it all in as former friends go face to face with contradicting convictions plots are thickening cause you pitched in you feel important now must ve been high as a kite from snorting clouds sorta proud of yourself and the way you hold your ground distastefully wore the shroud how s it feel to have puppets to order round but i saw through you even before i found how you would say no beef give me a dap and hit me with a quarter pound your loyalty s watered down bottled with a squirt cap but when the drama popped off where the fuck are you to plug the cork back  men are as harsh as women are vindictive picking apart minutiae on some bitch shit kids all in your business forget honesty nowadays you ll be lucky to find that quality in a drama odyssey where cats never react responsibly and i m jostling with haters hypocrites and hypochondriacs abolishing their dated ignorance and fighting copycats and if i don t give my patience a rest i ll probably take my anger to death complaining about some pain in my chest aged and distressed thinking bout who just fucked me over 20 years ago amazing how pricks can miss your skin yet pierce your soul but where s the line at like where does loyalty appear to fold and what do you owe someone and just what do you feel you re owed but yo you know when you ve been done wrong that numb calm a breach in the moral code s eternally portable the moral of the story s old even if it s poorly told beware of cats that straddle fences like the chain link rodeo

leave stains so the next man falling at least can see things i think of my life reliving every memory staring into the walls of my epitome falling nothing but walls but its all right my back to the

spent looking at nothing but i keep on glaring steadily hoping for something i stare into space through my cell gate for 80 years i ve been known as inmate 14278 walls can t confine me on the noose every week and when the guards take me for my shock treatment i be leaving out the space in my head to control the minds and unearth the undead the problem is i m only out for two days and i return to my coma and these walls and bars around me surrounding me these walls ain t holding me back they can t tell me where we at i m uncontainable surrounding me these walls ain t holding me back they can t
