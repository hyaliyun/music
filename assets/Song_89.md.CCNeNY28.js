they do verse 1 heaven presents another smash hit for jesus he keeps you rockin when we re droppin phat masterpieces we re on the side of the god who s been rejected the one who took flesh died but who s resurrected jesus the full godhead manifested grace and peace to all those chose and elected check it but on the real things aren t chill as they seem cash seems to make mad people blaspheme that s what the ill deed that man s greed leads to it s got you bitin that hand that feeds you he s grieved to the heart bone and the marrow all because god gets more respect from the sparrow jesus died for men but who wants to live with him can t stand him they want the mammon the benjamins and if it s men then it s within the natural whim to live a life of unrestricted sin huh sounds fun but like a hand and a gun sin and death go together like sanford and son so this plan is done it s not hard to hear squads talk hard and live like they don t fear god plus we re in the era of the human superstar but no matter who they are they fall tryin to pull a coup d etat answer me how can this be sensible man tryin to overthrow god the invincible learn this principle that i m droppin god s omnipotent omnipresent he s omniscient and sovereign that s the first lesson now in this session from my crew we need forgiveness we know not what we do hook 2 father forgive them for they know not what they do father forgive them for they know not what they do for puffin blunts and pullin stunts and drinkin brew for the criminal acts done by criminal crews verse 2 i m more than fascinated by the facets of creation and nature i m infatuated by the facts and attributes of my creator i wager this world don t even know his name and those who do they treat it like growin pains and go insane when it s mentioned feel the tension between god and man i ride the land and see there s nuff work to be done between the earth and the one who made it everything belongs to him so we give props through songs and hymns just like david but once again the sons of men have formed a pact another culture without god is on the map lord i apologize for all the guys who go one way when you clearly say otherwise father forgive them for they don t know your plan who can stop your motion or even slow your hand no one can but still this world they want to have a face off with the soon coming king who s runnin things like a racehorse they pace off ten steps turn and shoot haven t even learned the route and to boot swearin they can make it straight to god but wait the odds are stacked up against the man whose back is against the god whose hand rules the land but ah what a relief to have my plan reversed no longer am i down with planet earth where man is first the actual fact was i was born with the natural knack cuz to put god in the back and that s backwards truthfully i now belong exclusively to the club where god is no longer where he used to be stop the mutiny save the eulogy christ ain t dead my nocka he s livin i often prayfather forgive them for they know not what they do verse 3 you wanna please the judge please jesus cause he s it that s most definite i represent like i believe it jesus be the savior of every man true dat our sinned killed him once kill him again we ll never do that we re the crew that sticks to facts from god s word like glue traps peep the fly tunes that bring the triune crew back if you lack christ you lack the realistic picture your view s tainted now let s repaint it with the scripture so mentally you ll vibe with the first century begin to see christ who gave his life to save men for free you ll see the chains of sin and the key the pains of sin and the fee the names of you and of me and the whole adam family taking turns bangin in nails and thorns you ll see our sin that was hangin him you ll see him raised and see the state of modern history you ll see the hate for god and wonder how this could be but this to me is no mystery cause it s true we need forgiveness we know not what we do bridge cheating on taxes for corporate crimes and malpractice thieving for excess for even worshipping the lexus for the life of sin and being proud of it for shifty politics for teaching ten year olds to pack gats with the hollow tips for the bragging the godless rapping the kidnapping shooting and stabbing for riding satan s bandwagon father forgive them for they know not what they do father forgive them for they know not what they do for trashing up your planet breaking every commandment taking your grace for granted living life unlike you planned it outro how can this be on your earth yet we have no worth cause we re separated look at us making moves runaway trains on our own tracks only you can bring us back

servants to make his name famous i ll highlight one particular servant for the purpose of encouraging your worship to the lord furthermore charles haddon spurgeon was born on the outskirts of london 1834 his dad and his grandpa were both in the ministry his mother was praying for his soul since his infancy naturally intelligent rapidly developing but lacking jesus fellowship that would be irrelevant the god of his mother unknown though christ was up in his home the faith just wasn t his own the lord answered prayer when at the age of 10 young charles became convinced of the wages of sin for the next five years the spirit brought conviction terrors and affliction aware of his condition one sunday morning though the stormiest snow kept charles from going in the church he d normally go randomly stepped into a church heard the words look to me and be saved all the ends of the earth and though only heaven knows the name of the preacher that s the day that spurgeon became a believer the lord is so merciful always so purposeful those whom he draws find his call irreversible immediately after spurgeon s conversion obediently he was earnest to serve him the lord poured his spirit on spurgeon abundantly anyone could see that he spoke with profundity extraordinary giftedness seen proclaiming god s mysteries at the age of fifteen in a place called waterbeach graced with the sort of speech that even made the old folks say this boy can preach in fact he was so crafted after the master a baptist church snatched him and asked him to pastor at the time he was seventeen years old on fire for the king who redeemed his soul people flocked from everywhere it was quite a scene called to a church in london at the age of nineteen he was more than ready to his lord he was dedicated even though he was never formally educated if you would have scratched him he would bleed bible a rich prayer life was his means of survival amount that he read was truly mind blowing steeped in the writings of dudes like john owen and by god s grace he fed the sheep new manna in london met his wife her name was susannah behold the grace of god stand to the side the spirit exalting the lamb who has died it can t be denied this man we describe was simply a tool in the hand of his god to observe this servant s extremely instructive one word about spurgeon is he was productive preached jesus no speakers loudly he d shout it each week packed houses of crowds in the thousands his sermons were published sixty two volumes he worked almost like he just knew he would die soon made mad disciples passed on his knowledge established a school to train pastors in college sold out to the lord jehovah his portion also he built two homes for the orphans a monthly magazine plus he wasn t too busy to write books about a hundred and fifty god s grace in spurgeon was manifest but remember the best man is a man at best yes he struggled with depression consistently sick kid both he and susannah physically afflicted he experienced as a servant of jesus the power of god made perfect in weakness later on comes complications his stands for orthodoxy got him shunned by his denomination but through all the hardship and all the controversy he never stopped relying on the sovereign god of mercy and when he had finished pressing towards the goal he entered into heaven at the age of fifty seven his life is a case of god s grace effectively at work in sinners to leave a great legacy the proof is many years later in your speakers we re praising jesus for raising up the prince of

christians lining up on both sides by gods grace ill address this without pride the question concerns those for whom christ died was he trying to save everybody worldwide was he trying to make the entire world his bride does mans unbelief keep the saviors hands tied biblically each of these must be denied its true jesus gave up his life for his bride but his bride is the elect to whom his death is applied if on judgment day you see that you cant hide and because of your sin gods wrath on you abides and hell is the place you eternally reside that means your wrath from god hasnt been satisfied but we believe his mission was accomplished when he died but how the cross relates to those in hell well they be saying interlude yeah yeah that s what they be saying cats be saying that he tried but i m saying did he try and fail or did he succeed is there gonna be one drop of the savior s blood in vain nah perish the thought the lamb will receive the reward for his suffering verse 2 father son and spirit three and yet one working as a unit to get things done our salvation began in eternity past god certainly has to bring all his purpose to pass a triune eternal bond no one could ever sever when it comes to the church peep how they work together the father foreknew first the son came to earth to die the holy spirit gives the new birth the father elects them the son pays their debt and protects them the spirit is the one who resurrects them the father chooses them the son gets bruised for them the spirit renews them and produces fruit in them everybodys not elect the father decides and its only the elect in whom the spirit resides the father and the spirit completely unified but when it comes to christ and those in hell well they be saying interlude so if we can agree that the election of the father is not universal and the regeneration of the holy spirit is not universal why would the atonement of the son be universal that would put the persons of the trinity completely at odds with one another but the triune god is completely unified verse 3 my third and final verse heres the situation just a couple more things for your consideration if saving everybody was why christ came in history with so many in hell wed have to say he failed miserably so many think he only came to make it possible lets follow this solution to a conclusion thats logical what about those who were already in the grave the old testament wicked condemned as depraved did he die for them cmon behave but worst of all youre saying the cross by itself doesnt save that we must do something to give the cross its power that means at the end of the day the glorys ours that man centered thinking is not recommended the cross will save all for whom it was intended because for the elect gods wrath was satisfied but still when it comes to those in hell well they be saying outro look at the end of the day this is about giving god the maximum amount of glory know what i m saying we proclaim the cross that actually saves not makes salvation possible but actually saves matthew 1 21 his name shall be called jesus because he will save his people from their sins not might save them not try to save but no he will actually save them it s a definite atonement aye yo this ain t controversy for the sake of controversy or theological nitpicking salvation is of the lord and to him alone all the glory but let s get into the text and see what the scriptures have to say about it lord thank you for the cross","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:

were covered with many eyes that watched as they probed my insides and analyzed they weren t aliens because their faces were invisible more like chameleons with a nature that was mystical completely irresistible mind control trying to mold my will to theirs and redesign my soul slicing me up like cold cuts i was broke up if i could i would ve spoke up but they had me yoked up and then i woke up

time to stay patient with great haste i raced and slipped when i tripped over my play station my green bean bag broke my fall as i groped for the wall behind me i could sense his open jaws the smell of his breath was hot sulfur not kosher i yelled as he crept and got closer knocked over a vase no space to race with him shocked over his pace i was face to face with him envisioning my imminent

the tussle wanted to choose to hustle but i couldn t move a muscle i was hurting i thought i was a goner for certain then i looked and saw the sunlight through the corner of my curtain at this point i thought he would devour for sure but he just stood over me for a half an hour or more as the morning flooded the bedroom i could see a little better but his face was still obscured by a black hooded sweater just then it must have been an illustrious gust of wind that thrust him into the room s other end my physical felt rejuvenated i opened the door the whole house illuminated by the sunlight my chance to bounce i hesitated because something just wasn t adding up it resonated dedicated to go back and get some better data feeling heavy weighted yet it was like i levitated over to the corpse my

tomb depraved to the grave astray every day every breath brings death in adam all die in adam all die were rebels like the devil scheming like demons prideful with our idols disgusting with our lusting twisted and sin sick selfish and helpless in adam all die in adam all die everybody knows that they re guilty our conscience condemns us shows us we re filthy truth be told we really have no answers for why we fall short of our own moral standards the evidence for god is simply bountiful and it s illogical to think we won t be held accountable a universal day of judgment approaches any rational notion of justice would presuppose this and deep down inside everybody knows this but we disregard it because our deeds are atrocious we prefer the vicious our words are malicious our slurs pernicious we find the absurd delicious depraved in our appetites the things we crave are lacking light because sin s got us enslaved and shackled tight and if we are to understand the fruit we need to go back and examine the root the world we live in wasn t always like this the early days had perfect righteousness and bright bliss man and woman under god ruled government at first bubbling with mirth immersed in loving with no hurts god gave what theologians call the covenant of works forbidden fruit the day you eat of it you ll be cursed husband wasn t alert wife lacked discernment entrapped by the serpent and that was the first sin the consequences were monumental in fact i m not convinced they had a clue of what they d gotten into their eyes were opened more truth in the lies to their surprise they didn t get the prize they were hoping for they see their nakedness and now regret it they tried to cover their guilt and then blame shift how pathetic and it s a true story you want some evidence we ve been doing the same thing ever since  we talk adam and eve cats think we re throwed off really they don t think it relates to thugs in north philly but it s like switchfoot said we were meant to live but in the garden adam was our representative so when the judge executed the sentence adam s guilt was imputed to his descendents global calamity major debt pain regret the reign of death total depravity and yes i m aware that cats were not there which opens the door to charges of that s not fair but god is not subject to fallen notions of fairness besides when it comes to god s glory most could care less we can t measure how we chase sand treasures and banned pleasures similar to our ancestors so instead of saying if you were there what you would do seek your refuge in adam number two the problem with the human race is not most deeply that everybody does various kinds of sins behind all of our depravity behind all of our guilt behind all of our personal sinning there is this mysterious connection or union with adam our father whose sin and we been in him in some mysterious way also sin and die and are condemned what christ has done for all who are in him is

courtyard saw some burning crosses interrupted i heard curses tossed from the nurse s office i m not sure what developed there but heard something about students on welfare denied health care many of the girls were already impregnated cafeteria segregated people separated in fact it was legislated most could not compete and sadly only the rich kids got to eat the poor kids and orphans were tossed the smallest portions and that s just a portion i saw even more sin went to an assembly in the auditorium the kids were in a frenzy they booed the valedictorian the student government indeed was full of pride the class president was selling weed on the side impropriety was common with a lot of variety and there was no honor even on the honor society they were full of great schemes even the debate team girls were taking slim fast boys were up in gym class ironically attendance was packed for all sports in class they fall short they re at the basketball court they re building more jails than schools you do the math i won t even mention what i saw in the computer lab at the end of the day half the school was in detention and that s not to mention those who were out on suspension i walked around to see anything extra curricular most kids had left there was nothing in particular one thing caught my attention that i would call shocking in the bible club a girl was teaching false doctrine i went to the princpal s office to meet the principal but found the principal to be a man of few principles and yet he has fans he says he has plans for advance in the badlands fat chance on my way out corner of my eye happened to glance the ten commandments were tossed in the trash can so that concludes my report dear superintendent a school like this just can t be what you had intended and since i can t see it being built up from the ground therefore my recommendation is to shut it

breath draws me closer to a deep test it s month number seven it s been ten days i ve been awake all night reflecting on my ways a threat to my peace in this greatest of moments because i m the high priest and it s the day of atonement the lord is so holy and perfect i m nervous i m floored that he chose me to worship through service don t ask me why the god who crafted the sky drafted this weak guy from the clan of levi preceding generation taught me to read the regulations deep meditation on decreed revelation extreme trepidation breeds hesitation yet i must lead and be the representation my occupation to intercede for the nation but indeed my own sins need expiation the wrath of jehovah s grim sin is no joke to him the hope is slim for unholy men coming close to him he s spoken in his word the proper way of approach to him nadab and abihu got it wrong and he roasted them these things i weigh as i sigh this could either be the greatest day of my life or the day that i die so you say that you wanna know the lord do you really wanna stand before the lord do you know what it takes to meet the lord god is an all consuming fire so you say that you wanna know the lord do you really wanna stand before the lord do you know what it takes to meet the lord be careful what you desire for now no time to focus on my sinning i bathe in the laver though it seems extreme i put on the holy coat made of white linen craving his favor i m ceremonially clean i check to inspect no tangible faltering next i must collect the animals for the offering a spotless ram and a bull the components god gives to make atonement for my own sins this part of the ritual makes me real cautious because the very sight of blood makes me feel nauseous still i proceed by snatching him close slashing his throat when his blood splashed on my coat reacting i choke gasping that s when i m grasping god s reaction that sin provokes i take a moment to reflect on the blood spilled in this staring at the goat to be sent into the wilderness i ll confess israel s sins with my hands on his head symbolizing guilt transferred instead to a substitute the living god provided and stamped guilty of our sin driven outside the camp this beautiful picture of hope and grace motivates and i don t want my fear to make this dope occasion go to waste change my outer garments slow my pace yo i brace myself to stand before jehovah s face in the holy place so you say that you wanna know the lord do you really wanna stand before the lord do you know what it takes to meet the lord god is an all consuming fire so you say that you wanna know the lord do you really wanna stand before the lord do you know what it takes to meet the lord be careful what you desire the time has come the great moment has arrived about to enter in what a lonely enterprise look at the other priests they speak only with their eyes rope tied around my ankle just in case i don t survive i enter through the first curtain to a dark room i m standing in the holy place my thoughts consumed i m caught off guard i m unraveling at this stage my heartbeat so hard it s rattling my ribcage feeling like i m disintegrating and i can t stand comforted by the light emanating from the lampstand this helps my vision i can see the showbread i think of god s provision that helps me go ahead i need courage to worship man this is intense i take burning coals off the altar for the incense the sweet aroma fills the room the smoke protects my eyes one sight of jehovah seals my doom it s no mere coincidence i m here surrendering with fear and trembling i m nearly entering i feel like running scared hoping i m not unprepared stunned with fear no one comes in here but once a year nevertheless i m at the point of no return besides i don t want my anointing to be spurned after counting to three next time i inhale i m in the holy of holies beyond the veil the first thing i realize is i m thrilled that i ve entered into god s presence and yet i m still alive i m awestruck by the weight of his terrible beauty it s almost unbearable but i must fulfill my duty approach the ark the first part of my work s complete when i sprinkle blood

concern to me is to reach you with a lesson as i watch eternity bleed into the present i sit back and reflect on the days of my youth how doing things my way kept me away from the truth if the lord

gonna be with the lamb and his bride you can go first i ll worship and stand to the side is the pain of a son neglected connected to the aim of a gun directed at a face the same as the one reflected in his mirror that s something to wonder about but dad i never heard i love you come from your mouth so if you wanna know why i didn t choose to share your name part of it s because you refused to

righteousness credited priceless inheritance through what christ has merited grace and peace to the ambassador grace and peace to my brothers redeemed thought grace and peace to my man lee jerkins

due praise suppressing the truth in their wickedness theyre ruthless therefore god gave them over to their sinful ways and because of nature we have no excuses chapter twos for those who think they dont fit in this category they think theyre on the path to glory nope wrath fury they point the guilty to hell theyre swelled lacking humility even though theyre filthy as well needing more than a bath because like a greedy man who hoards his cash in the same way theyre storing up wrath for the day when gods righteous judgment is revealed and all see their sin debts an infinite amount when no

this helps us resist the adversary christ spilled his capillaries thats why our savior cant be mary thats a burden only the god man can carry in justification god declares sinners to be righteous by

your songs hear about all of my wrongs like you never played me like pong like you never went out and did nothin wrong it s crazy forever turned into so long and now that you re gone i had to move on and i m happy with him but i still can t pretend that i didn t go fuck with your friend every now and again i be thinkin of then i be thinkin that that was something i would never intend and especially when it was me who you trusted to take on your feelings and try to remend it s so hard pretend i would lie in your bed givin you head listen to all of the things that you said listen to all of the you read you were chasing a dream i would party instead young and in love young and we re dumb i can taste all of the pain in your tongue i can taste all of my pain in the rum knew it was over before it begun lookin for fun burning my lungs learnin my favorite feeling was numb bought every dinner you barely bought one maybe i cheat and then we could be done that would be done we were so broke you were the one that turned into a joke i kept us afloat you were the one that kept us on the rope damn now you are the man huh i see you turned into somebody i can t stand huh knowin you man it is all part of your plan huh you crazy fuck i had the chance i should ve ranuh never would tell me you cared never were there remember that night that we went to the fair every fine girl that walked by you would stare see even when there mark you never were there if all i care bout is my makeup and hair all you care bout is the ego you wear you tear me apart continue to tear now i m with someone who actually cares fuck you but i can t keep you off my mind i m seein everything you drop sometimes i wish that i was blind you make me relive my mistake a million trillion fucking times see you re a coward and a stupid rap persona is what you hide behind and my whole family still adores you i tried a million times i would have only did that for you i can t act like i don t know you every night i would explode you made me feel i was below you mark i wish i could ignore you but i can t damn near to you i am healin but it s taking so long cause though he s gone and you are wonderful it s hard to move on what do how then could you tell me you love me again and again you were only a friend it was hard to pretend i wrote so many letters but never hit send i was never content i was set on me being a rapper i thought about music and thought of you after it s funny how tears turn to laughter and tears on the page they can turn into a masterpiece that s how you told me to leave i remember that night it s as clear as can be you found a new man and he loves that you drink and he loves gettin head but don t care what you think you look pretty in pink you look naughty in red we know these are the words that would never be said and we re chasing a topic that s over your head cause you think about me every night as you lie in your bed that s real near to you i am healin but it s taking so long cause though he s gone and you are wonderful it s hard to move on near to you i am healin but it s taking so long cause though he s gone and you are wonderful it s hard to move on  well i guess we all change mark i guess we all change i hope that you get everything that you want as you yell and you stand on the stage you took all your pain and turned it to fame they re screaming your name and going insane i kept all our pics but threw out the frame before i knew witt i knew mark now they re one and the same but what about me motherfucker forgot about me motherfucker except when you talk about me motherfucker i m tired of hearin bout me motherfucker your mouth was a blessin and now it s a weapon remember the time and the love we invested i m postin a pic and i m getting attention my tits and my ass get a favorite a second see you were with me but were thinking of her now i m with him and i m thinking of you together to never whatever we were we re stuck in a cycle

you came to my school stayed up all night and we talked about life my parents and i we would constantly fight you said when you make it i might be a stay at home wife apparently that wasn t right relivin a moment that lasted a night and honestly mark gotta start to move on with your life sincerely a letter we never would write like what are we doin like what am i doin writing these letters but what am i provin i m stuck in my room and i m spilling it all making up what you would say if you call i might be the biggest mistake of em all my biggest mistake was to think that i never could fall like falling for you fallin in love follow my dream and that s all of my love i just want to feel i ve been feelin so numb to think that i know how you re feelin is dumb we re done right from the

it s black it s white but still the power about where the green is for real and i done known a lot of dealers and known a lot of interns the main difference hustlers get paid in the end term so only passion really impress me gangsters and scholars respect me so you really don t stress me they get defensive when i spit but no one really could check me they send me traps but i move past them no one really compress me and i know a lot of peers that try to act like rappers but they still ain t got the heart to say that black lives matter see they came for the slang and they stayed for the drugs me i came for the knowledge and i stayed for the love millions of poor kids and we teaching them the wrong way think i give a fuck if hov cheated on beyonc children starving cops killing people for nothing but you think that i should worry bout who rihanna be fucking that s no slight to em but to the bullshit i throw adblock pops taught me bout this shit back when we would slap box cause while they show you the left they hit you with the right that s why i keep a wide perspective so that everything s in sight was times i let the bleakness pervade everything in life but now i m thinking bout getting better every single night take the darkest of the thoughts and i try to give em light and they tried to give me pills i just told em give a mic okay guys now i just came from the park and this kid teasing me because i have filas on now mind you i am not a material person i just wear filas because you know i like the colour and i think they re cool they might not be what s popular today but you know that s what i like so you know i told the kid it s not about what i have on my feet it s about what i have inside my head no matter what i m wearing no matter what i have on it s about my

too many soulful even a couple dissin women callin em groupies hoes and bitches got off stage and i m like yo i know that we killed it ran into a familiar face a female who comes in and supports us i said peace she said wait let me talk to you for a minute i know it s none of my business but i wasn t impressed by your performance i said word shit i love feedback and criticism she said i miss the passionate spirit your political vision quite honestly i wasn t offended by those references to women but you re only continuing society s conditioning it hit the heart of me i told her that this was part of me i stand up for human rights and treat others how i would wanna be treated but every song can t be seepin with freedom cuz the other side of me is sexist then people will feel that i m preachin everything s peace and love uhh that s somewhat misleading because this world is fucked up and i m a pro duct to what i m seeing not to justify but just to touch on my being i learn from these verses and my purpose gets surfaced with demons now i am sexist i m prejudice i put that in my music she said she heard that perspective but before she turned around she said we have a flame your fire s ignited with sound are you building the empire up or using your fire to burn it down consumption contradiction i m conflicted with being a hypocrite and through these songs you can witness

down light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down light it up to burn it down down down down down down down now one thing that i ve always struggled on is how to incorporate drugs and alcohol into my music outside of sober songs cuz on that perspective that s all over my records but the other side isn t represented unless it sessions with xp how can i admit that i love to smoke weed knowing the kids are listening and many of them look up to me not to say that i m a role model but i know that words are power and if i condone bottles and chronic i am sending out the message it s okay hey i believe that it is chronic can be medicine but it s all about your relationship with it see i m either off in the wagon riding and everyday with the spliff constantly looking for a balance but habit turns to addiction and hip hop music and weed they re inseparable so mcs that don t smoke or drink talking about it to me seems questionable it proves how much people just want to be accepted and not seem straight edge to their audience so keeping it real is neglected cuz when i m smoking i wouldn t wanna bump a song like this put on some dev and break out the swishers and a bong and some licks see that s a part of me too and i know that i would make more money if i wasn t as true to all the struggles of the blunted consumption i m going through make music for the party and the people support you i burn brother ali and buy 50 what does that say to you bring it back around am i building the empire up or using my fire to burn it down  consumption contradiction i m

was a little rushed an open heart and she certainly couldnt fill it up watching and waiting with dedication to make her quit i made the mistake again playing with this relationship our love was flavorless no reason to savor it a favorite love but when we re making it she aint convinced just waiting but patience wasnt the way to go and not saying shit really couldnt have made her go i never gained control i only played the role i then became a certified heart breaking pro fade away inside away to hide i was never strong enough to love someone past giving up afraid to stay this time and i can tell where this is going we had our separate motives open to moving along though i could never show it was time to throw it i just cant control that our love was out of focus and keep us apart and

method it excludes metaphysics and uh i guess i wouldn t believe in anything if not for my lucky astrology mood watch college you feel so small you know you go to college you study about guys like leonardo who did everything a scientist a pai a great a great painter a great architect and designer and you feel like an idiot i wanted to expand my life in the way that leonardo did and that s why i took up juggling i know what you re saying you re saying steve where do you find time to juggle well i juggle in my mind whoops ok um but people look at guys like like the mona lisa hahaha leonardo s mona lisa and they think ohh that s not so great but not a lot of people know this the mona lisa was painted with one stroke he just went pllft how s this ok i m sorry alright ok ok ahhhh excuse me just went to the bahamas for a second well anyway i guess you can tell that uh i m into language language is kinda my thing being a comedian and uh if you don t have a command of the language nothing to be embarrassed about but uh because this is uh my profession and uh let s face it some people have a way with words and other people oh not have a way see i m into language you have to have a command of the english language or you re just nowhere i mean like take say you get out college or whatever you re doing you re gonna go into business say you re going to open a bank now you just for example you ve got to give it the right name it s got to be something big and strong like security first trust and federal reserve and you have to name a bank that because nobody is going to put their money in fred s bank hi i m fred i have a bank you got 1 500 i ll put it i ll put it here in my white suit white suit right hand pocket ok you gotta remember that i got a great dirty trick you can play on a three year old kid see kids learn how to talk by listening to their parents see see this is a good one you can pull on them see what you do you have a three year old kid and you want to play a dirty trick on them whenever you re around them you talk wrong so now it s like his first day in school and he raises his hand may i mambo dogface to the banana patch give that kid a special test get him out let me give you a warning ok i was in paris about two months ago and it was just a little vacation it was on the east coast i had seven days off and say well i ll just go over there i ll go to paris but let me give you a warning if you re going over there here s an example chapeau means hat ouef means egg it s like those french have a different word for everything i m serious see you never appreciate your language until you go to a foreign country that doesn t have the courtesy to speak english i went over there thinking no problem i don t speak any french i m thinking no problem english is a universal language everybody no i ll just it ll be easy i get off the plane get into the taxi say to the driver i dig baby talk ok have i started yet i have ok well then let s just keep going oh so so anyway you go to paris france and um well let s go back to what i was talking about about uh paris france i remember don t worry no so did i say a courtesy to speak english i said that ok now i went over there thinking oh everyone s going to speak english no problem i don t speak a word of french it s a universal language so i ll just be able to speak english so i get off the plane i get into a taxi the first indication i m going to have trouble i say to the driver i d like to go to a hotel please whaat what is that you re saying so the first thing you do this is really dumb you think this will help you adopt a french accent i would like to go to zee hotel so that s nothing so i went out and bought a little french phrase book hoping to memorize little phrases you know can i go to the bathroom things like that but french is not like spanish spanish you can sound it out it s easy for americans every vowel is a syllable casa de pepe donde esta casa de pepe but french is like jouen de le droit what happened what happened he spoke french help him so the only thing i could remember was cheese omelette omelette du fromage i m practicing all the time omlette du fromage i m meeting people hey omlette du fromage finally i got into a restaurant and go omelette du fromage and the problem if you order in french the waiter thinks you speak french he goes and you go yes he brings you a shoe with cheese on it and you also told him to force it down your throat i ll have a shoe with cheese on it force it down my throat and i want to massage your grandmother ok i finally figured out the secret to ordering food it s all sound effects went into a restaurant wanted to order milk eggs and ham i go in and i go the waiter looked and me and goes i beg your pardon ok enough
