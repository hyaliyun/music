gold bold never sold to a bidder that claim to glitter you re so bitter like kitty litter as for damage don t tell me what another do cause i quote that i m r a w so make room cause fighters are doomed try to consume and make your own tomb a grave or a casket a tisket a tasket you re rhymes out of basket boy you get your ass kicked for frontin like you hittin hard when your arms are too short to box with god so don t even touch cause i come with too much address and bless any mic that i clutch and for a rapper to challenge my freestyle he must be senile and that s why meanwhile back at the ranch the brother asiatic chosen one is expandin with a new branch so many slept on the nonchalant act now wake up sucker this is mortal combat make you say daddy i don t want none kool moe dee i seize and freeze mc s with these degrees put me to my knees or at ease chiiiillld please i break it down to bring on the next act rappers are so full of shit they need ex lax so stop griffin your mind is driftin prepare yourself cause i get swift and captivate the crowd but you can t understand at times i gotta say to myself god damn as i get hot and still be gettin warmer and i don t have beef with no other performer keep to myself never bother another but if a rapper tries to diss i crush the motherfucker frontin mc s that be tryin to riff need to save it and don t even play with me when i react like a volcano eruptin i step to you and say now what s up then every word ll be just like surgery cuttin you open so rush to emergency or even bow to your knees and bend low or get played like a game of nintendo j o k e s ain t my style i ain t a child that s why i don t smile i combine a line designed to find behind the mind so divine the other rappers need resign as i go on from night to morn beginning to end from knowledge to born whenever rappers are lookin for static looks like a job for king asiatic n e send me competitors then again it might just be better to just slow down you don t wanna throw down i get busy get you dizzy like a merry go round feel the wrath of a big daddy raw rhyme and competition prepare for wartime be alert for where i drop the bomb at as i destroy you with mortal combat  i roll so bold with soul control the whole patrol of folders molders towin black gold so let it be said let it be read cause i lead ahead of others whose rhymes are old as pro keds tryin to diss the big daddy repertoire moi you steady screamin out a antique segment wrote as i just play em like a pregnant roach and stomp em for tryin the forbidden your rhymes ain t hittin boy you won t be gettin none of or in front of cause every one of my adversaries lack you little son of o bit uary columns will read your name if you ever try to step to the big daddy kane so any claimin or aimin to be champion against me psssh can t be won i rank supreme and it s a rapper s dream to scheme and fiend for my technique but redeem cause there s only room for one teacher wise words from a wise man ll reach ya i teach freedom justice and equality peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours slaves from mental death in power that s the reason before i drop this bomb i say peace to the nation of islam daddy i don t want none daddy i don t want none

takes the form of variations and fugue on a theme of purcell now with the orchestra there are four sections or teams of players the strings the woodwind the brass and the percussion each of these sections uses instruments which have a family likeness they make more or less the same kind of sound in the same way first then the whole orchestra and then afterwards each section in turn will play the theme written 250 years ago by the great english composer henry purcell the first section is woodwind where the players blow and the instruments are made mostly of wood in the brass section the players also blow but the instruments are made of metal the stringed instruments large and small are played with a bow or plucked with the fingers though the harp is always plucked the percussion group includes anything which is struck when they have played the theme you will hear it again on the full orchestra now each instrument will play a variation of its own the highest of the woodwind section is the flute and its little brother the piccolo oboes have a gentle plaintive quality but they can be penetrating enough when the composer asks them to be clarinets are very agile their sound is smooth and mellow bassoons are the largest of the woodwind team they have the deepest voices the highest voices in the string section are the violins they play in two groups firsts and seconds  violas are somewhat larger than violins and so have a deeper tone still larger and deeper are the cellos their voices are warm the double basses are the grandfathers of the string family heavy grumbling voices the harp has 47 strings and several foot pedals to alter the pitch of the strings the brass family begins with the horns these are made from brass tubing coiled into a circle perhaps the most familiar of all the instruments are the trumpets the trombones have heavy brassy voices and the bass tuba is heavier still there s a large number of percussion instruments we can t play them all but here are the most familiar ones first the kettle drums often called timpani the bass drum and cymbals tambourine and triangle the side drum and chinese block the xylophone the castanets and gong and before they all play together the whip in these variations we have taken the whole orchestra to pieces now we are going to put it together again with a fugue the instruments come in one after another in the same order as before beginning with the piccolo and at the end while the others go on playing the fugue the brass will play for the last time henry purcell s great

she look like an angel knew she wasn t from here i knew that she didn t hang a round this part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger cause this stranger was stranger than i could explain you see she said she wasn t married but the ring on her finger told me that she was lyin and just using the same uhh game i use on women so i couldn t even blame her spitting the game i spit to em when i m trying to bang her i bump into this dime he told me that he used to know you he told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you he said what he said with a passion like it was so true wouldn t take advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn t know you there s pictures in my pocketbook almost got it i ll show you she digs in her purse and while she fumbles around to find that photo i m like oh no there s some trouble in town i turn around to see two officers coming in now they walk in real suspicious and come and sit down so close i can see they barrels of the guns to the ground so close that they can listen to either of us now we turn back around and then she says no need for whispering then she tells me i don t really give a damn whose listening try to make it last a long time was my mission and he kept on tripping and then i got pissed at him hit em with my fist and them punches were never missing him  i don t know who you are but you seem very nice so will you talk to me shall i tell you a story shall i tell you a dream they think i m crazy they don t know that i like it here okay let s get this straight your man cheated on you and now you talking to a perfect stranger like it s making you proud and the rest of this conversation she just telling me how wasn t her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile she said pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul look closer you ll see a coward who uses a smile as power fleeing the smoke strength couldn t stand it another hour so she did what she did then she went to go take a shower damn what do you mean i couldn t tell you that i m missin him i don t understand what your saying how did you get rid of him she dissing him as i ask her what it is she did to him she stops then i say ay keep talkin i m listening i don t wanna tell about the images i m picturing henny spilling then she tell me for real and that the feeling that i was feeling is that i wanted to kill him something s wrong here and i know just who is the villian her voice was getting louder the moral is getting clearer the officers is looking at us and i can tell they can hear her told me it was protection reached for it in the stash the plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass bust it before the blast she thought she was free at last baby i think you crazy i m sorry i m pressing for time i gotta go grind times been interesting now i m sweating and stressing this girl s got me guessing that this conversation is two types of evil confession she pulls a clearer picture it s my damn ex best friend how you know him she told me that she was with him at his house watching movies for sundays when they be chilling and that s exactly the day that the hospital came to get him the feeling was the worst feeling she possibly could be feeling stood up and then i yelled out why the hell did you kill him i didn t kill him i have aids she had sex with em and that s crazy

care in the hopes that st nicholas soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads mom in her kerchief and i in my cap had just settled down for a long winter s nap when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter i sprang from my bed to see what was the matter away to the window i flew with a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave a luster of mid day to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick well i knew in a moment it must be st nick more rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name on dasher on dancer on prancer and vixen on comet on cupid on donner and blitzen to the top of the porch to the top of the wall now dash away dash away dash away all as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly when they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky so up to the rooftop the coursers they flew with a sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof the prancing the pawing of each little hoof as i drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just op ning his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when laughed like a bowl full of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk and laying a finger to the side of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh and to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight merry christmas to all and to all goodnight

and the submarine sinks below the ground now that the leaves have turned to gold the moments all glow frozen and free from time and out here on my own i watch it ebb and flow here with the fire burning low in the honey mist that breathes crooked maple fingers trembling all around i feel the winds that blow out here between the dark and light the summers gone and the reeds bow down as the colors change all along the water line and when its time the landslide will free what froze inside while all around the rocks collide you finally see the lines that point toward the light that never dies melody shelter in the darkness take hold of me now memory trapped in a corner dark fingers are long but all around streaming down rays of blue light calling out these silver sounds are raining down on me here on the wheel the rhythms turning all around up above the darkened sky is bleeding i feel the world turning upside down these are the reasons that we lay down on the ground drawn through a funnel all the colors run together turning brown wait for the waves to come and carry me away down on the ground the sounds of voices in the echoes seem to say and as the carousel circles unceasingly watch while the ripples decay in this rolling time and cascading the winds set the wheels in motion and its turning in the mist around me rolling and turning into the mist around me kissed by the water and held in your mothers arms green where you tumble and roll in these fields the shapes of the bodies that shift in the sun while the blossoms all scream and it sleeps around me the earth in these memories heals around me touches these woods and these waters all paved with gold gleaming in daylight the voices ring on they pull while the pointing lay down in the storm and this

homesick don t blink sit around and wait for the bell or try to stand and get a better view of it going to hell roll back to the bottom hoping everything s the way it was to find how far behind you gotta fall to see it all at once itching to glimpse those ominous hands that orbit us and smack you out the way because you ain t enough to offer up dirty cup full of pocket lint from the fat cats at the grown up table with rules printed on your placemat and everything an inch out of your reach dreaming of picking forbidden fruit from in between your teeth you ve discovered a hidden truth and admitted defeat when nobody in the world wants to walk to your beat keep calling yourself god in plainclothes and beat your puffed chest while the rats race for safe holes with a treasure map to where they keep the rainbows your arms too short to play cat s cradle with angels  puppet on a string just watch everyone else and do the same thing puppet on a string act like you mean it and you win a

ruin something pretty while i m going through the motions awkward walking cats stalking that path the average joe went with a baseball bat in hand til everything he owns is broken everyone s doing the

day sundown eat kiss wife watch news sleep something ugly on the television had a bad dream no name with a great big crowd to entertain it s the city that never sleeps except on the train passing out on your shoulder and begging for change and everyone pitches in just enough to get it away eyes on the prize cereal box stuck to your hand digging for that happy ending and finding kinks in your plan dummy poker faces only make you look funny on the phone in dirty undies yelling show me the money on the road to riches running with holes in your shoes bummy and you ain t stopping because you heard it s gonna get sunny well it all means something and you ll be damned if you don t get it while the rest are filing out you stay behind to watch the credits until the final second when the screen

april over the waves she rode sailing into tomorrow to a gilded age foretold the night was black with starlight the seas were sharp and clear moving through the shadows the promised hour was near lights were holding steady gliding over the foam all the lords and ladies heading for their eternal home the chandeliers were swaying from the balustrades above the orchestra was playing songs of faded love the watchman he lay dreaming as the ballroom dancers twirled he dreamed the titanic was sinking into the underworld leo took his sketchbook he was often so inclined he closed his eyes and painted the scenery in his mind  cupid struck his bosom and broke it with a snap the closest woman to him he fell into her lap he heard a loud commotion something sounded wrong his inner spirit was saying that he couldn t stand here long he staggered to the quarterdeck no time now to sleep water on the quarterdeck already three foot deep smokestack was leaning sideways heavy feet began to pound he walked into the whirlwind sky splitting all around the ship was going under the universe had opened wide the roll was called up yonder the angels turned aside lights down in the hallway flickering dim and dull dead bodies already floating in the double bottom hull the engines then exploded propellers they failed to start the boilers overloaded the ship s bow split apart passengers were flying backward forward far and fast they mumbled fumbled and tumbled each one more weary than the last the veil was torn asunder tween the hours of twelve and one no change no sudden wonder could undo what had been done the watchman lay there dreaming at forty five degrees he dreamed that the titanic was sinking dropping to her knees wellington he was sleeping his bed began to slide his valiant heart was beating he pushed the tables aside glass of shattered crystal lay scattered roundabout he strapped on both his pistols how long could he hold out his men and his companions were nowhere to be seen in silence there he waited for time and space to intervene the passageway was narrow there was blackness in the air he saw every kind of sorrow heard voices everywhere alarm bells were ringing to hold back the swelling tide friends and lovers clinging to each other side by side mothers and their daughters descending down the stairs jumped into the icy waters love and pity sent their prayers the rich man mister astor kissed his darling wife he had no way of knowing be the last trip of his life calvin blake and wilson gambled in the dark not one of them would ever live to tell the tale or disembark brother rose up gainst brother in every circumstance they fought and slaughtered each other in a deadly dance they lowered down the lifeboats from the sinking wreck there were traitors there were turncoats broken backs and broken necks the bishop left his cabin to help all those in need turned his eyes up to the heavens said the poor are yours to feed davey the brothel keeper came out dismissed his girls saw the water getting deeper saw the changing of his world jim backus smiled he never learned to swim saw the little crippled child and he gave his seat to him he saw the starlight shining streaming from the east death was on the rampage but his heart was now at peace they battened down the hatches but the hatches wouldn t hold they drowned upon the staircase of brass and polished gold leo said to cleo i think i m going mad but he d lost his mind already whatever mind he had he tried to block the doorway to save all those from harm blood from an open wound pouring down his arm petals fell from flowers tell all of them were gone in the long and dreadful hours the wizard s curse played on the host was pouring brandy he was going down slow he stayed right to the end and he was the last to go there were many many others nameless here forever more they never sailed the ocean or left their homes before the watchman he lay dreaming the damage had been done he dreamed the titanic was sinking and he tried to tell someone the captain barely breathing kneeling at the wheel above him and beneath him fifty thousand tons of steel he looked over at his compass and he gazed into its face needle pointing downward he knew he lost the race in the dark illumination he remembered bygone years he read the book of revelation and he filled his cup with tears when the reaper s task had ended sixteen hundred had gone to rest the good the bad the rich the poor the loveliest and the best they waited at the landing and they tried to understand but there is no understanding for the judgment of god s hand the news came over the wires and struck with deadly force the love had lost its fires all things had run their course the watchman he lay dreaming of all

habits i never thought that id have to but did bottle the water under the bridge and toss another written page of my history to the wind when it blows cause all of this disaster has lead me home and left a lot of room for me to learn to grow yeah you are not alone grab hold of yourself i know what its like to get blown away i know you that youve done your dirt and youve dug your graves and it feels like it wont be saved i say grab hold yourself and face those days when you feel like it always rains ive seen the sunny side of hell that which i never thought id find for myself never thought id find for myself not your same old song ive been writing on a mirror with a razor blade and chased away the devil in my brain that played me like a spade cause day to day painted jaded faith issues a shade of gray and cowered hid behind emotion just to play it safe a pawn slowly turning victim to my wrongs i had to wake up all alone to finally figure out my wants in the house of haunted love the past will keep me warned and explain me even if youre listening through the storm i found a purpose and if you heard this then sit it down pick its brain until it opens up and redirects the sound the conductor frozen thunder rumbling through the ground with a perfect little twist of that suited armor and crown you created built for denying it hiding the cuts and bruises due to the self inflicted bone crushing anxiety im with you so understand that all of this within you has chiseled you a flower out of stone yeah you are not alone  grab hold of yourself i know what its like to get blown away i know you that youve done your dirt and youve dug your graves and it feels like it wont be saved i say grab hold yourself and face those days when you feel like it always rains ive seen the sunny side of hell that which i never thought id find for myself never thought id find for myself you are not alone no you are not alone no you are not alone not you are not alone no you are not alone not you are not alone no you are not alone grab hold of yourself i know what its like to get blown away i know you that youve done your dirt and youve dug your graves and it feels like it wont be saved i
