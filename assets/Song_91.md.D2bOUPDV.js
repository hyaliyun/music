their cheshire grins and the raconteurs and roustabouts said buddy come on in cause cause the dreams ain t broken down here now they re walking with a limp now that small change got rained on with his own 38 and nobody flinched down by the arcade and the burglar alarms been disconnected and the newsmen start to rattle and the cops are telling jokes about some whorehouse in seattle and the fire hydrants plead the 5th amendment and the furniture is bargains galore but the blood is by the jukebox on an old linoleum floor and what a hot rain on 42nd street and now the umbrellas ain t got a chance and the newsboy s a lunatic with stains on his pants cause cause small change got rained on with his own 38 and no one s gone over to close his eyes and there s a racing form in his pocket circled blue boots in the third and the cashier at the clothing store didn t say a word as the siren tears the night in half and someone lost his wallet well a surveillance of assailants if that s what you wanna to call it and the whores hike up their skirts and fish for drug store prophylactics with their mouths cut just like razor blades and their eyes are like stilettos and her radiator s steaming and her teeth are in a wreck and nah she won t let you kiss her but what the hell do you expect and the gypsies are tragic and if you want to buy perfume well they ll bark you down like carnys sell you christmas cards in june but but small change got rained on with his own 38 and his headstone s a gum ball machine no more chewing gum or baseball cards or overcoats or dreams someone s hosing down the sidewalk and he s only in his teens cause cause small change got rained on with his own 38 and a fistful of dollars can t change that and someone copped his watch fob and someone got his ring and the newsboy got his pork pie stetson hat and the tuberculosis old men at the nelson wheeze and cough and someone will head south until this whole thing cools off cause cause small change got rained on with his own 38 yeah small change got rained on with his own

the waters from which they emerged they glanced upon the world as their own yet deep in their hearts they knew all the time that this was not really their home so they rode on yes they rode on on hidden roads through barren wastelands untrodden by both man and beast from the distance their fire was gleaming like a lamp amidst dark eternity a bitter moon hovered above them the night lit sole by its glow from high in a sky of ominous dye in which dark clouds drifted slow so they rode on yes they rode on they rode with shut eyes as the sun rose regardless of earth s vanity but with wide open eyes they paced the night and pondered its mysteries they sat at the crossroads with high and with low yet neither could alter their course riches were offered unto them yet indifferent and without remorse they rode on yes they rode on  and each lonely vagrant that crossed their path felt how his heart grew cold yet be marvelled at their scarred faces so beautiful distant and old some say they ve heard them singing in strange tongues of melancholy of the gods of the night and of glory of the dead and their memory oh they rode on yes they rode on say goodbye to the light come twilight come dark night say goodbye to the light come twilight come dark night could you have rode there with them would you have joined their march or would you have them ride on away into the dark would you have

grinding gears while the rest of us held out twenty odd years we watched our town like a photograph fade as the company came to take it all away they tore down the church the schoolhouse burned they
