over sprinkle with a crystalline delight keeping time time time in a sort of runic rhyme to the tintinnabulation resonating very fine from the jingling and twinkling of the mellow wedding bells golden bells what a world of happiness we know they must foretell through the balmy air of night how they ring out their delight from the molten golden notes all in tune hella tight while a liquid ditty floats on the moon from sounding cells what a gush of euphony voluminously wells how it swells how it dwells on the future how it tells to the swinging and the ringing of the rapture that impels of the bells bells bells check the bells bells bells go to sleep to the rhyming and the chiming of the bells rock the bells hear the loud alarm bells brazen bells what a tale of terror now their turbulency tells in the startled ear of night how they scream out their affright too horrified to speak only shriek and ignite in a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire leaping higher higher higher with a deep desperate desire and a resolute endeavor that accentuates the pyre and how now to sit or never by the side of the moon oh the bells bells bells know that terror s coming soon how they clang and they roar what a horror they out pour on the bosom of the air with eternity in store how the danger ebbs and flows with the twanging and the clanging yet the ear distinctly tells in the jangling and the wrangling how the danger sinks and swells in the anger of the bells of the bells go to sleep to the clamor and the clanging of the bells hear the tolling of the bells iron bells what a world of solemn thought their monody compels in the silence of the night how we shiver with affright at the melancholy menace of their tone it excites hear it float like the rust within our throats it s a groan and the people all the people in the steeple all alone and who tolling tolling tolling in that muffled monotone feel a glory in so rolling on the human heart of stone because they are neither man nor woman neither brute nor human the grim reaper is king while he rolls and he rules a paean from the bells as his merry bosom swells with the paean of the bells as he dances with the fools keeping time time time in a sort of runic rhyme to the paean of the bells to the throbbing of the bells keeping time time time as he knells

the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures for the magnificence of his head for his exactingness and egotism but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his fathers emotion which vibrating round them disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother by looking fixedly at the page he hoped to make him move on by pointing his finger at a word he hoped to recall his mothers attention which he knew angrily wavered instantly his father stopped but no nothing would make mr ramsay move on there he stood demanding sympathy mrs ramsay who had been sitting loosely folding her son in her arm braced herself and half turning seemed to raise herself with an effort and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy a column of spray looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force burning and illuminating and into this delicious fecundity this fountain and spray of life the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself like a beak of brass barren and bare he wanted sympathy he was a failure he said mrs ramsay flashed her needles mr ramsay repeated never taking his eyes from her face that he was a failure she blew the words back at him charles tansley she said but he must have more than that it was sympathy he wanted to be assured of his genius first of all and then to be taken within the circle of life warmed and soothed to have his senses restored to him his barrenness made fertile and all the rooms of the house made full of lifethe drawing room behind the drawing room the kitchen above the kitchen the bedrooms and beyond them the nurseries they must be furnished they must be filled with life charles tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time she said but he must have more than that he must have sympathy he must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life was needed not only here but all over the world flashing her needles confident upright she created drawing room and kitchen set them all aglow bade him take his ease there go in and out enjoy himself she laughed she knitted standing between her knees very stiff james felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass the arid scimitar of the male which smote mercilessly again and again demanding sympathy he was a failure he repeated well look then feel then flashing her needles glancing round about her out of the window into the room at james himself she assured him beyond a shadow of a doubt by her laugh her poise her competence that it was real the house was full the garden blowing if he put implicit faith in her nothing should hurt him however deep he buried himself or climbed high not for a second should he find himself without her so boasting of her capacity to surround and protect there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by all was so lavished and spent and james as he stood stiff between her knees felt her rise in a rosy flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass the arid scimitar of his father the egotistical man plunged and smote demanding sympathy filled with her words like a child who drops off satisfied he said at last looking at her with humble gratitude restored renewed that he would take a turn he would watch the children playing cricket he went immediately mrs ramsey seemed to fold herself together one petal closed in another and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself so that she had only strength enough to move her finger in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion across the page of grimms fairy story while there throbbed through her like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat the rapture of successful creation every throb of this pulse seemed as he walked away to enclose her and her husband and to give to each that solace which two different notes one high one low struck together seem to give each other as they combine yet as the resonance died and she turned to the fairy tale again mrs ramsey felt not only exhausted in body but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin not that as she read aloud the story of the fishermans wife she knew precisely what it came from nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully ominously a wave fall how it came from this she did not like even for a second to feel finer than her husband and further could not bear not being entirely sure when she spoke to him of the truth of what she said universities and people wanting him lectures and books and their being of the highest importanceall that she did not doubt for a moment but it was their relation and his coming to her like that openly so that any one could see that discomposed her for then people said he depended on her when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important and what she gave the world in comparison with what he gave negligible but then again it was the other thing toonot being able to tell him the truth being afraid for instance about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be fifty pounds perhaps to mend it and then about his books to be afraid that he might guess what she a little suspected that his last book was not quite his best book and then to hide small daily things and the children seeing it and the burden it laid on themall this diminished the entire joy the pure joy of the two notes sounding together and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness a shadow was on the page she looked up it was augustus carmichael shuffling past precisely now at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships that the most perfect was flawed and could not bear the examination which loving her husband with her instinct for truth she turned upon it when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness and impeded in her proper function by these lies these exaggerationsit was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation that mr carmichael shuffled past in his yellow slippers and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out as he passed

cavity and a kaleidoscope for a soul that would reflect its light back at me depending on the day she shone different colors she had a handful of favorites that she kept locked inside her cupboards shes got drawers in her stomach she knows how to swallow her pride but it get compartmentalized in the crawl spaces and builds up inside she says shes fine but she lies so she keeps sunglasses on to try to hide her eyes and at night she stays out of the shadows its one of the only times that her true color shines she says youre talking about me like you know what i mean but you know nothing nothing at all about leading that kind of life baby doll my heart is as black as my lungs are i keep bitterness in these cabinets next to all my bad habits you either find faith or lose it you either had it or have it well i have had it so i wear my smile on the good days that i keep in these baskets wear my grimace facing life without the opiate for the masses you pop your god like these pills that i take to bear the circumstances whats the difference i called out to your god but he never listened you call it praying well im just wishing that things couldve been different she says her daddy didnt want her so she squanders to be the mother father figure for her daughter a piece of clay recreating herself as a beautiful basin from the situation that she s been placed in build for retaining life a feat manufactured without the proper water or the potter and her heart it cuts like a knife its priceless and its as hard as a diamond but shes been selling it for nickels and everybodys been buying so now theres cracks in the basin the way theres cracks in the basement the place that daughters daddy beat her in when shed dare to face him the way theres cracks in the cement that she can dig her high heels in while she waits for another customer to come and pour his water in she says her momma was a little bit crazy a little lazy a little biased towards the media mainstream prone to fainting or naming it fainting when shed pass out after blazing just after papa came home late for the hazing the alcohol made him crazy see thats when i started praying praying praying but nothings started changing changing changing so thats when i started blaming blaming blaming were all on our own there s nothing in those stars theres no hand out there to save me save me save me she loved vogue and american teen magazines almost as much as she loved vomiting to try to match the model women that shed she on the movie screens says i believe that she loved me and maybe its a fantasy but i believe that she cared for me the way she cared for her methamphetamines dont tell me i need saving you point those fingers so righteously all these people pushing for me to practice their piety well i gave your god a chance to save me so thank you kindly greatly but its just me and my baby me and my little girl us against the world so sweet dreams daughter im gonna be your mother im gonna be your father every time another man just like her father bought her she spent the nickels on diamonds for her daughter she had prisms for eyes and one time she took off her mask and let me inside i paid her for her time told her that she was valuable and she replied yeah but about as valuable as the next man in line well i came to tell you that youre beautiful i think youre lovely i think that youre made for more than youve settled for she said all of them every single one of them tell me they love me i used to dream i used to have big plans i used to believe that there was something out there that was bigger than me and that he would take care of me and that i could grow up to be whatever i wanted to be but i guess its too late for me so i started selling my dignity to give my daughter that dream and to make it a reality i used to dream i never meant to quit so whos to blame for this bullsh shh shh girl i will not even mention it the hands that were dealt i dont understand and i dont have all the answers and i dont know all the plans i just wanted to tell you that youre beautiful i think youre lovely i think i know love that loves the unloving yeah you told me your god was gorgeous but i just cant see it i want so badly to see color i want so badly to believe it i keep an ounce of hope inside one dresser drawer in my chest every now and then it grows if watered to a seedling at best one time it grew and stretched through the cracks into the next but i just cant make it blossom cause i just cant make myself forget and now theres nearly nothing left shes got a kaleidoscope soul but shes got grayscale lenses shes got rod iron bars to keep up her defenses shes got all of her emotions hung up on hooks in her closets shes got little hints of happiness tucked away inside her lockets shes got high hopes of heaven stapled to the doors of her cabinets she wraps the hopes up in packets of personal baggage to mask it shes got angels singing to her from the lips of ballerinas in a music box that she keeps locked behind this door thats cemented to a heart of rocks but if you knock long enough they say that door could be opened heres to hoping until then i wanted you to know that youre beautiful like i think youre lovely i think i you re made for more than you re settled for she said all of them tell me they love me i think youre gorgeous i still think
