walking about on his long red legs chattered in the egyptian language which he had learnt from his mother the corn fields and meadows were surrounded by large forests in the midst of which were deep pools it was indeed delightful to walk about in the country in a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm house close by a deep river and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves so high that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright the spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood in this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest watching for her young brood to hatch she was beginning to get tired of her task for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells and she seldom had any visitors the other ducks liked much better to swim about in the river than to climb the slippery banks and sit under a burdock leaf to have a gossip with her at length one shell cracked and then another and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried peep peep quack quack said the mother and then they all quacked as well as they could and looked about them on every side at the large green leaves their mother allowed them to look as much as they liked because green is good for the eyes how large the world is said the young ducks when they found how much more room they now had than while they were inside the egg shell do you imagine this is the whole world asked the mother wait till you have seen the garden it stretches far beyond that to the parsons field but i have never ventured to such a distance are you all out she continued rising no i declare the largest egg lies there still i wonder how long this is to last i am quite tired of it and she seated herself again on the nest well how are you getting on asked an old duck who paid her a visit one egg is not hatched yet said the duck it will not break but just look at all the others are they not the prettiest little ducklings you ever saw they are the image of their father who is so unkind he never comes to see let me see the egg that will not break said the duck i have no doubt it is a turkeys egg i was persuaded to hatch some once and after all my care and trouble with the young ones they were afraid of the water i quacked and clucked but all to no purpose i could not get them to venture in let me look at the egg yes that is a turkeys egg take my advice leave it where it is and teach the other children to swim i think i will sit on it a little while longer said the duck as i have sat so long already a few days will be nothing please yourself said the old duck and she went away at last the large egg broke and a young one crept forth crying peep peep it was very large and ugly the duck stared at it and exclaimed it is very large and not at all like the others i wonder if it really is a turkey we shall soon find it out however when we go to the water it must go in if i have to push it myself on the next day the weather was delightful and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water and jumped in with a splash quack quack cried she and one after another the little ducklings jumped in the water closed over their heads but they came up again in an instant and swam about quite prettily with their legs paddling under them as easily as possible and the ugly duckling was also in the water swimming with them oh said the mother that is not a turkey how well he uses his legs and how upright he holds himself he is my own child and he is not so very ugly after all if you look at him properly quack quack come with me now i will take you into grand society and introduce you to the farmyard but you must keep close to me or you may be trodden upon and above all beware of the cat when they reached the farmyard there was a great disturbance two families were fighting for an eels head which after all was carried off by the cat see children that is the way of the world said the mother duck whetting her beak for she would have liked the eels head herself come now use your legs and let me see how well you can behave you must bow your heads prettily to that old duck yonder she is the highest born of them all and has spanish blood therefore she is well off dont you see she has a red flag tied to her leg which is something very grand and a great honor for a duck it shows that every one is anxious not to lose her as she can be recognized both by man and beast come now dont turn your toes a well bred duckling spreads his feet wide apart just like his father and mother in this way now bend your neck and say quack the ducklings did as they were bid but the other duck stared and said look here comes another brood as if there were not enough of us already and what a queer looking object one of them is we dont want him here and then one flew out and bit him in the neck let him alone said the mother he is not doing any harm yes but he is so big and ugly said the spiteful duck and therefore he must be turned out the others are very pretty children said the old duck with the rag on her leg all but that one i wish his mother could improve him a little that is impossible your grace replied the mother he is not pretty but he has a very good disposition and swims as well or even better than the others i think he will grow up pretty and perhaps be smaller he has remained too long in the egg and therefore his figure is not properly formed and then she stroked his neck and smoothed the feathers saying it is a drake and therefore not of so much consequence i think he will grow up strong and able to take care of himself the other ducklings are graceful enough said the old duck now make yourself at home and if you can find an eels head you can bring it to me and so they made themselves comfortable but the poor duckling who had crept out of his shell last of all and looked so ugly was bitten and pushed and made fun of not only by the ducks but by all the poultry he is too big they all said and the turkey cock who had been born into the world with spurs and fancied himself really an emperor puffed himself out like a vessel in full sail and flew at the duckling and became quite red in the head with passion so that the poor little thing did not know where to go and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard so it went on from day to day till it got worse and worse the poor duckling was driven about by every one even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him and would say ah you ugly creature i wish the cat would get you and his mother said she wished he had never been born the ducks pecked him the chickens beat him and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet so at last he ran away frightening the little birds in the hedge as he flew over the palings they are afraid of me because i am ugly he said so he closed his eyes and flew still farther until he came out on a large moor inhabited by wild ducks here he remained the whole night feeling very tired and sorrowful in the morning when the wild ducks rose in the air they stared at their new comrade what sort of a duck are you they all said coming round him he bowed to them and was as polite as he could be but he did not reply to their question you are exceedingly ugly said the wild ducks but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family poor thing he had no thoughts of marriage all he wanted was permission to lie among the rushes and drink some of the water on the moor after he had been on the moor two days there came two wild geese or rather goslings for they had not been out of the egg long and were very saucy listen friend said one of them to the duckling you are so ugly that we like you very well will you go with us and become a bird of passage not far from here is another moor in which there are some pretty wild geese all unmarried it is a chance for you to get a wife you may be lucky ugly as you are pop pop sounded in the air and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes and the water was tinged with blood pop pop echoed far and wide in the distance and whole flocks of wild geese rose up from the rushes the sound continued from every direction for the sportsmen surrounded the moor and some were even seated on branches of trees overlooking the rushes the blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees and as it floated away across the water a number of sporting dogs bounded in among the rushes which bent beneath them wherever they went how they terrified the poor duckling he turned away his head to hide it under his wing and at the same moment a large terrible dog passed quite near him his jaws were open his tongue hung from his mouth and his eyes glared fearfully he thrust his nose close to the duckling showing his sharp teeth and then splash splash he went into the water without touching him oh sighed the duckling how thankful i am for being so ugly even a dog will not bite me and so he lay quite still while the shot rattled through the rushes and gun after gun was fired over him it was late in the day before all became quiet but even then the poor young thing did not dare to move he waited quietly for several hours and then after looking carefully around him hastened away from the moor as fast as he could he ran over field and meadow till a storm arose and he could hardly struggle against it towards evening he reached a poor little cottage that seemed ready to fall and only remained standing because it could not decide on which side to fall first the storm continued so violent that the duckling could go no farther he sat down by the cottage and then he noticed that the door was not quite closed in consequence of one of the hinges having given way there was therefore a narrow opening near the bottom large enough for him to slip through which he did very quietly and got a shelter for the night a woman a tom cat and a hen lived in this cottage the tom cat whom the mistress called my little son was a great favorite he could raise his back and purr and could even throw out sparks from his fur if it were stroked the wrong way the hen had very short legs so she was called chickie short legs she laid good eggs and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child in the morning the strange visitor was discovered and the tom cat began to purr and the hen to cluck what is that noise about said the old woman looking round the room but her sight was not very good therefore when she saw the duckling she thought it must be a fat duck that had strayed from home oh what a prize she exclaimed i hope it is not a drake for then i shall have some ducks eggs i must wait and see so the duckling was allowed to remain on trial for three weeks but there were no eggs now the tom cat was the master of the house and the hen was mistress and they always said we and the world for they believed themselves to be half the world and the better half too the duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject but the hen would not listen to such doubts can you lay eggs she asked no then have the goodness to hold your tongue can you raise your back or purr or throw out sparks said the tom cat no then you have no right to express an opinion when sensible people are speaking so the duckling sat in a corner feeling very low spirited till the sunshine and the fresh air came into the room through the open door and then he began to feel such a great longing for a swim on the water that he could not help telling the hen what an absurd idea said the hen you have nothing else to do therefore you have foolish fancies if you could purr or lay eggs they would pass away but it is so delightful to swim about on the water said the duckling and so refreshing to feel it close over your head while you dive down to the bottom delightful indeed said the hen why you must be crazy ask the cat he is the cleverest animal i know ask him how he would like to swim about on the water or to dive under it for i will not speak of my own opinion ask our mistress the old womanthere is no one in the world more clever than she is do you think she would like to swim or to let the water close over her head you dont understand me said the duckling we dont understand you who can understand you i wonder do you consider yourself more clever than the cat or the old woman i will say nothing of myself dont imagine such nonsense child and thank your good fortune that you have been received here are you not in a warm room and in society from which you may learn something but you are a chatterer and your company is not very agreeable believe me i speak only for your own good i may tell you unpleasant truths but that is a proof of my friendship i advise you therefore to lay eggs and learn to purr as quickly as possible i believe i must go out into the world again said the duckling yes do said the hen so the duckling left the cottage and soon found water on which it could swim and dive but was avoided by all other animals because of its ugly appearance autumn came and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold then as winter approached the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air the clouds heavy with hail and snow flakes hung low in the sky and the raven stood on the ferns crying croak croak it made one shiver with cold to look at him all this was very sad for the poor little duckling one evening just as the sun set amid radiant clouds there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes the duckling had never seen any like them before they were swans and they curved their graceful necks while their soft plumage shown with dazzling whiteness they uttered a singular cry as they spread their glorious wings and flew away from those cold regions to warmer countries across the sea as they mounted higher and higher in the air the ugly little duckling felt quite a strange sensation as he watched them he whirled himself in the water like a wheel stretched out his neck towards them and uttered a cry so strange that it frightened himself could he ever forget those beautiful happy birds and when at last they were out of his sight he dived under the water and rose again almost beside himself with excitement he knew not the names of these birds nor where they had flown but he felt towards them as he had never felt for any other bird in the world he was not envious of these beautiful creatures but wished to be as lovely as they poor ugly creature how gladly he would have lived even with the ducks had they only given him encouragement the winter grew colder and colder he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller at length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could to keep the space from closing up he became exhausted at last and lay still and helpless frozen fast in the ice early in the morning a peasant who was passing by saw what had happened he broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe and carried the duckling home to his wife the warmth revived the poor little creature but when the children wanted to play with him the duckling thought they would do him some harm so he started up in terror fluttered into the milk pan and splashed the milk about the room then the woman clapped her hands which frightened him still more he flew first into the butter cask then into the meal tub and out again what a condition he was in the woman screamed and struck at him with the tongs the children laughed and screamed and tumbled over each other in their efforts to catch him but luckily he escaped the door stood open the poor creature could just manage to slip out among the bushes and lie down quite exhausted in the newly fallen snow it would be very sad were i to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter but when it had passed he found himself lying one morning in a moor amongst the rushes he felt the warm sun shining and heard the lark singing and saw that all around was beautiful spring then the young bird felt that his wings were strong as he flapped them against his sides and rose high into the air they bore him onwards until he found himself in a large garden before he well knew how it had happened the apple trees were in full blossom and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn everything looked beautiful in the freshness of early spring from a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans rustling their feathers and swimming lightly over the smooth water the duckling remembered the lovely birds and felt more strangely unhappy than ever i will fly to those royal birds he exclaimed and they will kill me because i am so ugly and dare to approach them but it does not matter better be killed by them than pecked by the ducks beaten by the hens pushed about by the maiden who feeds the poultry or starved with hunger in the winter then he flew to the water and swam towards the beautiful swans the moment they espied the stranger they rushed to meet him with outstretched wings kill me said the poor bird and he bent his head down to the surface of the water and awaited death but what did he see in the clear stream below his own image no longer a dark gray bird ugly and disagreeable to look at but a graceful and beautiful swan to be born in a ducks nest in a farmyard is of no consequence to a bird if it is hatched from a swans egg he now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him for the great swans swam round the new comer and stroked his neck with their beaks as a welcome into the garden presently came some little children and threw bread and cake into the water see cried the youngest there is a new one and the rest were delighted and ran to their father and mother dancing and clapping their hands and shouting joyously there is another swan come a new one has arrived then they threw more bread and cake into the water and said the new one is the most beautiful of all he is so young and pretty and the old swans bowed their heads before him then he felt quite ashamed and hid his head under his wing for he did not know what to do he was so happy and yet not at all proud he had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds even the elder tree bent down its bows into the water before him and the sun shone warm and bright then he rustled his feathers curved his slender neck and cried joyfully from the depths of his heart i never dreamed of such happiness as this while i was an ugly

trying to put distance between them she sees him scurrying turns an expression like a demented angel gina come on tony fuck me fuck me fuck me advancing on him firing the furniture tearing up the chair spilling television sets and computer toys shattering tony squirming away hit again in the thigh shocked scrambling over to the terrace windows her next shot shatters the window and as tony ducks again to the side we see outside onto the terrace behind him a young columbian punk no more than twenty one of the hitters is crouched there reacting to the broken window he doesn t hesitate turning his machine gun on gina gina is torn to pieces by the firepower blown across the room spine severed and dead before she hits the floor tony sees it yells something in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside the punk is taken by surprise not having seen tony and tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade the punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds at the base of the balcony tony from above grabs up the punk s machine gun and empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool spots tony yells up ernie get outta here tony they re everywhere ernie suddenly wheels hit in the face by a burst of silencer bullets we catch a brief glimpse of sosa s black aide the skull moving quickly along the wall of the house directly underneath the balcony on which tony stands tony tossing the empty machine gun aside wildly runs back into his office to get more guns crosses to gina corpse it takes him by surprise he comes to a dead stop kneels looking questioningly in her face tony hey gina come on you still angry at me i didn t mean to kill manny i

hauls out a rocket shoulder fired rocket launcher and straps an uzi across his shoulder he looks up at the monitor on the monitors the hitters are now darting across the foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs three of them are already huddled outside the door around the corpse of chi chi motioning to each other laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out tony loading his rocket intends to beat them to the punch talking to himself tony so you wanna play hunh say hello to my little friend here karroooomph the rocket tears down the door and blows the columbian punks off the landing into the foyer it sounds like armageddon one of the hitters screaming smoke billowing wildly tony at the height of his mad glory steps out at the apex of the stairs firing his machine gun and yelling tony whores cowards you think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh another hitter tumbles down the right hand stair tony who you think i am i kill all you fuckin assholes i take you all

army to kill me behind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go up in a burst of wind whipping around the office in auras of white it is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the skull moving from the terrace towards tony s back with a sawed off shotgun tony ha ha ha ha ha you whores you scum i piss in your faces ha ha ha ha ha the skull now inches from tony s back pulls the trigger and blows tony s spine out his belly tony crashes forward over the banister into the interior swimming pool below he floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters as the titles begin their crawl up the music theme is expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety the camera moving off tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters it says the world is yours and so for the brief moment it was our camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool panning past the dream villa past the shambles and the wealth past the hitters pillaging

come hear to die i m barely living a life with stressing like every night and the power inside is right i think i m losing control when you told me to move on i honestly felt broke you re only willing to show exactly what side you know too bad you never knew us i wanted to call it home holding on what we had there s barriers in our path we re needing to break through or you won t come back now everbody has had it everybody looks plastic fake they made dating you relatable so ask them when they re planning to break it making only mistakes the pacifist in my soul was only willing to take you and now you re fake too and now this mistake glued in the deepest part of my sub concious to change moods how could i blame you it s always the same truth that you wanted him yet i was the one to save you i sent over a text that always meant and i couldn t say it directly cause i ve been scared of perfection if only you got the message cancelled it when i sent it i ve been searching for you while we ve been losing connection always trying to pretend it instead of trying to defend all the meaning because you said that i m only here for a sec while regretting all of these feelings you never knew that i had i m sorry for all the pain i really wanna go back i feel the misery that it s piercing my heart in half for always choosing you first when you ve been choosing me last i m missing back in the past where no one cared about weight or shape these fake friends you said you would never date but now you hate us and you contemplate trust like every choice that i ve made is the same place of needing help looking for someone else plenty fish in the sea but all i m feeling are shells washed inside my heart mindset s in hell the spell is broken and you re provoked to tell me what and how i can connect again i m searching for someone to trust not to take a second guess you left and i wish you best you re more when i m feeling less you know that i was obsessed with you when you wore a dress sorry but i just vent alone inside my of my head and saying i m not as good as you probably wanting me dead always forgot to tell you how much worth that i held to so much love it would melt you you d help when no one else will frozen heart in a stone i promised love on my bones with all this family supporting me guiding me where to go but i can handle my own sh t and all of these fake pricks with mixed emotions soaking up on the same script so let me flip it i m driven to make a difference this chapter won t ever finish until you finally listen we re distant but that won t change us i feel like i played dumb writing bout a girl that s holding my hold world up won t ever get it still wondering why you said all these memories you ll forget and that s actually when you left so i guess

sucks how many frames you clock on a console 10 well fuck stop living in the past come to next gen where we re the best then where we clock a hot 60fps man and 64 simultaneous players but in this gen you re only 24 that s a failure to gamers well you ve got that static map design that barely changes i m about them real battlefields big open spaces and explain how a game that is claiming to have such a realistic dog could be such a fake bitch this rap battles no clever man it s audacious when you ve got rihanna and i ve got eminem on my trailers and what ve you got to offer in this next gen dawg cause whatever it is it s not good as my next gen dog he took out a helicopter man that s a violent stray poochie oh shit what is this a michael bay movie that s just a cutscene from your campaign for me that kinda shit happens in game so i ll blow a skyscraper up jihad jeep while you use the same damn gun week after week you are the kill streak in my land you pilot the plane not call it in on an earpiece on an ipad my nan could do that that s how it seems to me i wanna teach you a word accessibility remember fun have you even played a game before you think you know battles you can

old tree twice spoke to me and he said bring truth to the ones that you trust and make them believe that i still exist so he closed his eyes and i traveled back home back to my world to home i return and the birds cry out the old king has died with tears in my eyes i follow my heritage now i am to be the new elvenking the fire in my heart was burning like the flames of ancient times white willow with his knowledge opened up my eyes the vision of the world i had before was based on thousand lies white willow taught me how to live my life with truth green power light was flowing down my eyes like waters from the falls white willow filled my heart with lore i now recall the black horizons once i saw now turn to white as i pass by and now i know why man can t bear to know the nature of the truth and there it stands the only white willow tree with golden leaves and a sweet old voice he embraced me hard as rock and he told me gaze at the stars","is_english":"True","genres_list":"['folk
