all the packaged food was unhealthy and all the fruit looks bad you walk around for almost 10 minutes looking for an avocado before you realise this market doesn t carry avocados you settle for a packet of corn chips and a can of chilli then you realise you needed a can opener it s ok you needed one for the house anyay in the checkout line you listen to a couple talk about their child like he s a termite infestation they seem to wanna go home even less than you do you left your car in the lot and walk to the park it s mostly homeless people but one mother is trying to get her child to enjoy the terrible snow you feel embarrassed opening the can of chilli but then realise the company you re in and decide it doesn t matter after you dump your chilli into the bag of corn chips you realise you don t have a fork for a desperate moment you consider using a stick but ultimately decide to go without utensils by the time you re done you should be embarrassed your face and your coat are stained with chilli the phone starts to ring but your fingers are so messy you hesitate to pick it up when you see who called you re glad you missed it the mother and her miserable cold child seem

mother and my dad i know it grieved them so to think their only boy was bad i fell in with an outlaw band their names were known quite well how many times we robbed and plundered i could never tell this kind of sinful living leads only to a fall i learned that much and more the night i heard my master call one night we rustled cattle a thousand head or so and started them out on the trail that leads to mexico but a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about i thought someone was calling me i thought i heard a shout then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me and left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree and this time i knew i heard a voice a voice so sweet and strange a voice that came from everywhere a voice that called my name so frightened i was thinking of sinful deeds i d done i failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run the cattle they stampeded were running all around my pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground i felt the end was near that death would be the price when a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of jesus christ and i cried oh lord forgive me don t let it happen now i want to live for you alone oh god these words i vow my wicked past unfolded i thought of wasted years when another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers and the others rushed on by me and i was left to live the master had a reason life is his to take or give a miracle performed that night i wasn t meant to die the dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high and right behind it there was i afraid but safe and sound i cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground a pardon i was granted my sinful soul set free no more to fear the angry waves upon life s stormy sea forgiven by the

dreaming sure as i was born around my neck came this long skinny arm and he said howdy hoss my name is hank now what brings you here so i began to think i said hank brother you ve seen it all you ve seen em come and go and you ve seen em rise and fall and right now country music s got more singers than i believe i ve ever seen so many people got to follow out their dream but i feel different i said cause i m a natural born cat i m country to the bone but i don t wear no hat oh no two three said i started with lester back in 72 all i wanted to be was a little different like him and you he said whoa now it just takes a little longer to make it if you re different i guess but you just sing what s in your heart and god s gonna do the rest just be what you are at all times and just tell the folks out there the truth and that ain t gonna cost you a dime but if you plan to be different son you re just rolling the dice and you know you ain t the first one to pay that price cause there was me and elvis and there was bocephus too there was waylon and willie and there was bill monroe and i guess you know about ole johnny cash and i think what the world needs right now is a jumpin jack

truth is coming out i done traveled the globe and friendly skies i done traveled the road done had family members die since october in 04 when my album dropped asked how many albums i sold cause honestly i really don t wanna know see what i wanna know is what i wrote is it grabbin a soul into the truth of the fact that he rose i met a lot of people i been to some places i ain t been before and my hunger only increases as i go this is my true passion as i m passing through this life that is giving am i pleasin to the christ that was given on behalf of sinners just to see a holy god exalted through life that has been fully exhausted with his father s business my earthly visit before i lay in my coffin before you all i call god as my witness this is truly his business so on these tracks i will attack some new issues and old ones too so for you welcome back and i missed you let s go i caught some slack from a couple of songs that i wrote but my intention was to offer you some of my hope see my intention was to offer you some of the freedom that i experienced that came from studying jesus see i m convinced of the following facts of what you know affects how you live so knowing that is a proven fact affects the kind of i give to my listener the media s lying the t v is lying and guarantee the streets ain t telling the truth so what you want me to do but point to the bible for more than survival but god s word that be speakin to you they god breathe its true to know that and hold back is blasphemy so insult throw stones and laugh at me but my agenda is to pray for your soul and in love say the same things you should know so on that note i say so in conclusion i offer this album to god while at the same time i offer this album to y all and that may mean that i go out just like peter and paul for preaching jesus to the point where i m socially martyred but my rewards and my treasures will never be stowed on this earth but in a place where they can never be stole in heaven where i know the saints most definitely go cause our inheritance is imperishable and incorruptible and as i wait i pray with fervency cause the world and the church are in a human

mirrors and hammers falling down i am old man perez i am as cold as any hand in death i am what is left a smile made of lead a palladium s head a small pile of geraniums red as the earth now thrown the surface now grown into the fleshy remains of roots now shown shes all covered i m uncovered in the science of sleep the two become lovers as sparrows do defining beauty in the order of life if camus knew if jean paul saw in a room with no exit you are beyond the walls i m searching for a face in the sweating of the stones who robbed me of my faith and said i m better off alone a writer gets away a character set free though everything i am says he was better with marie but who knows maybe were just too young to young at heart so we go back to where were from to gain our start now she and i are the same left to our eyes in the rain left to despise why we came left to the mind i am cain able is my will to survive it again and yet i do if i never hear a yes i do kept by you i am but a trade i am just business the patron saint of lost interests like the bike you rode in the street light left behind when the times got old i am just a taste the face that you took and forgot in a space full of books and i am locked in the hook to a song i have no looks i do not play a long my home my bone and marrow i am alone i am the only sparrow frightened by the moon the silence of it all it lightens up your room the nightingale she calls passing through the sky reminding you to sleep the world is full of guise victory defeat victory defeat victory defeat victory defeat i am your stranger
