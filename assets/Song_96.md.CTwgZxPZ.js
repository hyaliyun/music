you know when life was so easy to live no pressure no reason to think and like 3 4 5 and even in 6 shit ask anyone how did it feel on that night before christmas when santa was real ah you had to figure out the names of your gifts then sort them all and make it a list you had a stocking and you get and fill it until it was packed and all you had to do was to leave him out some milk and a snack surviving was pain the night that he came cos i could never get to sleep that shit would drive me insane but instead of trying i just lie there and wait and keep my eyes on the sky while i m hiding my face just me thinking that it might be the day that i see him fly by riding his sleigh games we re playing mario and sonic the hedgehog and back then was hang ten or rocking your sweat hog all these things that i want in a track it s so hard i just wanna go back yeah i wanna go go go go oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road i wanna go back oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road primary school was kinda cool i think i picked my best friend just cos i liked his pool plus he was always good at helping me try to keep my mind stable doing my times tables you had to know them all and them in order and everybody had to try and play the recorder the golden age of roller blades but in grade four i loved skate boards way more i played sport renowned as that menace who would always get in trouble in rounders and bat tennis and back then if stuff was all fair in love and warfare it wasn t in four square we relax playing marbles all class it was either that or trade basketball cards every day mum sorted all my lunch box i wrote me out an order from the tuck shop polo tops your shirts weren t buttoned up and everyone had run amok getting undercut that phase went half a week into spring that s when i got a shaved head and started leaving a fringe i know some hate it when their clothes updated but yo but i d have a heart attack for a starter cap we got summer for three hot months i d still be rocking cross colours in my reebok pumps  oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road i wanna go back oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road yeah and when i think of high school it starts making me sick inside i can t lie yo i hated the shit but it s funny till you get here you never can tell how good it really was from year seven to twelve when you went to school from nine till three then had to get home in time for tea and that s it yep no other real worries except maybe do a bit of study i d sit there right at the back writing a rap i couldn t give a shit about science or maths but trying to write an essay neatly in my own words no chance you ever see me doing homework but i just wish that i could go back now when you leave me to stay for even a day then i could see what i dream when i m on my own and i could be there i wanna go i wanna go oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road i wanna go back oh i wanna go all the way now i know what i would change going down that road i wanna go back

defined the step it s indefinite send me a message and try to help me out wish i could speak to a just tell me now meanwhile what s held me down till now is that inner force that brings the thoughts

trapped to life that comes right back here where i see defeat in every word that i write i turn in my mind and find myself immersed in uncertainty why it s like a curse when it occurs i deter and i try to fight it internally till it s worse and i m nervous in fright we re in this world givin birth but i ve hurt my entire time on this earth cause i can t determine a purpose for life pez is the person that s observant inside tryna interpret the science side and emerge on the surface and glide we get one turn you can t rehearse it return and then try it again instead just be alert for the

sick of the fact i spit it with tact creative with words so labelled a gift of the gab uh it s hidden with facts the simple don t see it and so all the critics attack and they re too quick to judge way too quick to judge but even the people around me do it ah so this is love ha i guess there s a curse to let your words combine with a pen and the paper converting a verse forgetting what hurts and

knelt beneath the third man s cross and slowly bowed my head i reached out to touch his feet and stained my hands with red and when i heard him cry in pain i raised my eyes to see the blood spilled from the third man s side and some of it spilled on me the third man wore a crown of thorns spikes held him to the tree i heard him say oh god my god hast thou forsaken me and there within the mighty crowd the ones who mocked him cried king save thyself if thy art king and then the third man died suddenly i heard the thunder roll saw lightning pierce the sky the third man was still hanging there and i began to cry i saw the boulders fall and heard the breaking of the ground then i awoke and though i d dreamed i touched my cheek and found my eyes were wet where i had cried a dream i wished i

his projects where the dealers push crack to fiends there he did some soul searching now he s back redeemed look at his album cover stained glass of the king wallpapers of gangsters hang up next to king solomon amen ra and king tut beneath that incense burns frank incense the fragrance of the prince priests the saint the angels fight in his defense light the hemp it s bright take a glimpse at the crouching statues within the tall fence of his castle i called on michael gabriel and uriel to pull me from hell a jury of twelve await my burial they said they want my great material my vision blurry can t tell i hear the bells near the church steeple where rafael awaits his fate break the curse of evil i m holding rosemary beads it s scary roll the hairy weed inside the blackberry leaves its cold but what worries me will my crew leave when they bury me come hurry see the brotherhood climbing a hillside at the fall of darkness the night arches over the projects as they speak of the legacy of priest the artist they share words of his hardship and he sung his psalms to a harpist his garment was blood soaked around his crown he wore halo of blunt smoke below his navel his guns poked so may this offering give your thoughts wings may it fly high start soaring pass the corpse of kings beyond the cloud scraping mountains travel the way of the falcon to a tucked away enchanted island you land see the ruins of his old palace the wide stone steps that leads to his throne you see his face made of hard stone he just sit there and zone my eyes are open but they re empty as the painted eyes on a doll walk inside the fog sit beside my catalog see his face it aged to something strange come in range upon his sculpture grows weed vines with small rosebuds so show love to the priest revelations and this is my salvations this is my salvation  king of mysteries who wast and art before the elements before the ages king eternal comely in aspect who reigns forever grant me

pretty girl and you wanna start speaking but you can t think of anything to say your mind goes blank and your heart starts beating so you make your excuses to leave it telling yourself there s no way to achieve it ah she s with all her mates anyway you don t wanna to disrupt the convo that she s deep in so you throw the towel in and feel a sense of relief as you get another round in but before long you re scowling cause you just clocked another guy start prowling you try and tell yourself not to worry she d never get with a guy that ugly but now she s playing with her hair and laughing at his jokes and they re not even funny what that should ve been you and if you had balls then it could ve been too you imagined it all going wrong but if you d just tried then it wouldn t be true now you re kicking yourself on the way home try na use everything else as a scapegoat she wasn t that fit anyway but you know that you ve only got yourself to blame though and that s the worst part you should ve moved when you had the first chance you vow that you ve learned your lesson and it happens again you ll talk to the girl fast  if only you could turn back time you d pluck up the courage to go and say hi but now you ll never know what could ve happened and you ll wonder about it for the rest of your life if only you could turn the clock back if only you could have a second go if only you had taken the chance things might be different but now you ll never know right but yo girls i know it s not always easy for you lot either i think as guys we get so wrapped up in the way we re thinking we never really stop to consider what it s like for you lot so it s only right that we get to hear your side of the story too ready let s go you all know the feeling when you re out with the girls at a bar for the evening you see a guy that you like and start giving off vibes in the hope that they ll reach him but he just doesn t seem to receive em no matter how blatant you make it so you assume he s not into you and go back to chatting to your mates that you came with pretty soon another guy approaches but it s clear that he just wants to get lucky he s not your type but you re too polite so you laugh at his jokes even though they re not funny but pretty soon he can sense that it s hopeless so he makes his excuses to leave you re relieved but it s only at that point you notice the other guy s nowhere to be seen the night carries on in a similar fashion you and your friends just wanna hit the dance floor but you can t cause it s full of guys grinding and grabbing and using chat up lines you ve heard before your patience starts wearing thin and you can even feel your eyelid twitching you snap at the next guy who comes over who now thinks all women are bitches you go home and start asking yourself why do i just attract losers and creeps why was the guy from the start not on it maybe there s something that s wrong with me if only you could turn back time youd pluck up the courage to go and say hi but now you ll never know what could have happened and you ll wonder about it for the rest of your life if only you could turn the clock back if only you could have a second go if only you had taken the chance things might be different but now you ll never know but what if we didn t have to wonder what if we really could turn back time would you make the most of it or let the fear get the better of you let s go back now and see just how much better this whole night could have gone starting with the fellas once again ready let s go we all know the feeling when you see a pretty girl and you wanna start speaking you feel the fear in your chest but you do it anyway cause these moments are fleeting you start walking and don t waste your time cause you wanna get there before you change your mind she s talking but you dont wanna wait so you excuse yourself and start saying hi this might sound a little forward but i just saw you and i thought you looked gorgeous and i knew if i didn t come over i d be full of remorse for being overly cautious she pauses and the silence it causes is awfully awkward but then she says it s nice to meet you and flashes a smile that s practically flawless you re absorbed in the conversation cause it s more interesting than the boring questions that your often faced with in this situation like whats your name and whats your occupation you chat about all the interests you share as you go and sit somewhere a bit more comfy and now you re playing with your hair and laughing at his jokes cause they re actually funny

what you heard that s my nigga that s my nerve she s forgiven for that time back when she left me on that curb told her selling her body isn t something she deserved and i know her well enough to know it s not what she preferred i m contemplating should i offer up my guest room or will i wake up with shit missing out my next room should i be the friend she never was to me or should i have left her like when she left me in that jeep fuck it my thinking gave her more franklins pulled up in my neighborhood made it my mission to make sure this lady and her baby good she saw my house and started sobbing out loud told me she always knew i d make it i m making her proud next morning i m yawning went to check if she straight saw her son was asleep i m guessing she was awake she was nowhere in
