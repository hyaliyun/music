wilson he led me through the streets of prussia talking as he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his boot heel he said there was a place where we should go so he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which we wandered til we reached a bubbly spring the knight grew very quiet as we stood there then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing he said i come from the land of darkness he said i come from the land of doom he said i come from the land of gamehendge from the land of the big baboon but i m never never going back there and i couldn t if i tried cause i come from the land of lizards and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died he told me that the lizards were a race of people practically extinct from doing things smart people don t do he said that he was once a lizard too his name was rutherford the brave and he was on a quest to save his people from the fate that lay before them their clumsy end was perilously near the lizards would be saved he said if they could be enlightened by the writings of the helping friendly book in all of prussia only one existed and wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook he said i come from the land of darkness he said i come from the land of doom he said i come from the land of gamehendge from the land of the big baboon but i m never never going back there and i couldn t if i tried cause i come from the land of lizards and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died  the helping friendly book it seemed possessed the ancient secrets of eternal joy and never ending splendor the trick was to surrender to the flow we walked along beneath the moon he lead us through the bush till soon we saw before our eyes a raging river he said that we could swim it if we tried and saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms would surely weigh him down and so he sunk and as his body disappeared before me i bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk he said i come from the land of darkness he said i come from the land of doom he said i come from the land of gamehendge from the land of the big baboon but i m never never going back there and i couldn t if i tried cause i come from the land of lizards and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died and the lizards they have died but rutherford and forbin weren t alone suddenly an unexpected movement caught his eye on the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing in the weeds who stared across at forbin with an unrelenting gaze a gigantic mass of muscles and claws the hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in the water and swam toward the region where rutherford lay and in a flash the beast was gone underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while forbin bewildered waited alone the seconds dragging by him seemed like hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream defeated he bowed his head and turned to go suddenly with a roar the creature emerged before him and held the brave knight s body to the sky and the creature laid the knight upon the shore and the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer that

watched my life go up in flames i pull the sword from the glowing fire and hammer beat it on the anvil forging it with rage and hate i will seal my enemy s fate i ingrave the blade with magic runes and summon gods by sacrifice in blood pure blue hate shines within this sword this magic sword will cut only once no sword has ever been like this one the avenger is it s name now my sworn enemy

tumbles to the ground the headless body lays gently down down to sleep in a pool of blood the avenger has lost its shine the magic is now drained dull and useless it rests in my hand it s purpose is

first is pride though some call it vanity a hustler s insanity can break up the family pride can have a man stuck in his ways not subject to change knowing that he ll end up in a grave it s the arrogance they say in us americans messes up marriages many sins pride is parenting like the second is something we all have or felt than cain or khan it s called wrath i seen a boss take it out on his staff seen a crip take it out on a blood causing a bath never seen a man making money while he mad so hustle plus wrath y all do the math now the third you probably heard from mop they say use

have guessed cause she walked in took the seat right across the aisle i knew we had a special connection the second i saw her smile she smiled as if to say hello haven t seen you on this bus before i gave her a look that said huh life is funny you never know what s in store by the way your hair is beautiful i bet it smells like raisins she looked at me in a way that asked did you have a nose job or something i m only asking cause your nose looks slightly better than the rest of your face i arched my eyebrow ever so slightly which was my way of asking do you want my old hewlett packard printer it still works kinda and i got a bunch of ink cartridges left then she let out a long sigh which i took to mean uh mama what is that deodorant you re wearing it s intoxicating why don t we drive out to the country sometime and collect deer ticks in a zip lock baggie oh yeah i gave her a penetrating stare which could only mean you are my answer my answer to everything which is why i ll probably do very poorly on the written part of my driver s test  yes it all happened on the jackson park express on the jackson park express on the jackson park express on the jackson park express i knew she was starting to fall for me cause she crinkled her nose which unmistakably meant baby lets wear each other s clothes and speak in a thick german accent and maybe someday we can own and operate our own mobile pet grooming service i couldn t hold back my feelings i gave her a look that said i would make any sacrifice for your love goat chicken whatever i could never hold you close enough let s have our bodies surgically grafted together oh surgically grafted together she picked up her newspaper and started reading to herself which i m sure was a way of telling me when you re cold i will warm you when you re shivering i will hold you when you re nauseous i will give you pepto bismol every hour for as long as the symptoms persist oh i i never ever want to see you cry so please let me cauterize your tear ducts with an arc welder then i glanced down at her shirt for a second in a way that clearly implied i like your boobs i cleared my throat quietly and then i looked away and i m sure it was obvious to her just what i was trying to say i was trying to say hey i d like to make a wall sized mural out of all the dead skin cells that you slough off while you sleep at night whoa o oh i d like to rip you wide open and french kiss every single one of your internal organs oh i d like to remove all your skin and wear your skin over my own skin but not in a creepy way then i m pretty sure she looked at me out of the corner of her good eye and though she never spoke a word this is exactly what i heard she was saying oh i wanna make out with you in an abandoned toll booth in the middle of a monsoon i wanna ride dolphins with you in the moonlight until the staff at sea world kicks us out i want you inside me oh like a tapeworm i pointed to the side of my mouth as a way of indicating hey i think you got something on the side of your mouth she licked the corner of her lips as if to say here i nodded implying yeah you got it and then the bus stopped at 53rd street and she got up suddenly where are you going pleaded my eyes baby don t you do this to me think of the beautiful children we could have someday we could school them at home raise them up the right way and protect them from the evils of the world like trigonometry and prime numbers oh no baby please don t go she brushed my leg as she left the bus i m sure that was her way of saying i m sorry this just isn t working out you re suffocating me i need some space to find out what life s all about so goodbye forever my love and deep inside i knew she was right it was time for us both to move on and though i never got her

sensation with an overwhelming sense of apprehension an emptiness that thunders out from beyond the minds horizon so far beyond our reach where consciousness coalesces like the billowing loom of thunder clouds the streaming runs of thought go round and round and round till the dancing funnels of wind touch down and the earth bows down in reverence lest it should be torn to pieces and blown into oblivi essence and all who live will run and hide and do what weve done since the dawn of time everyone flees from the cyclone winds of ones own mind but if one day we should stand on the canyons edge peer out through the beating rain the pounding wind youll find that everyone is everyone and everything is everything open up your hearts and minds cause i remember nothing one day now it all falls down but love must keep on loving so start the show here we go dark to light the day from night a roll of a mountain a rip in the sky turning the dust to flesh and ashes to breath a pull of a muscle a pin in the eye an initial spark to get this heart of mine pumping and another to get these feet of mine running but sadly theyve just taken me to a place where all is devoid of your embrace so baby now were falling baby now youre falling baby yeah yeah baby now were falling baby yeah tripping and tumbling flipping and fumbling flowing on the rivers of sadness that have been forever rumbling but from dawn until now of all the paths that i could have gone down of all the valleys that i could have been flowing through in spite of all the chaos and all that has come between us how is it i still find myself here with you so somehow we find ourselves here today a feeling in this oceanic sense of lucid dreaming a strange sort of spherical sensation an emptiness that thunders out from beyond the minds horizon and all of us we run and hide do what weve done since the dawn of time peering out through the beating rain the pounding wind everyone is everyone and everything is

nearly go blind they live at the foot of a mountain where the flowers last hardly a day but they live off the land and lend each other a hand on this island where night is their day they d punish me if i dare tell you and if i ask them they d say they don t know but what keeps them healthy even though they are not wealthy on this magical island is snow the flakes as they fall look like candy and the children rush out when it snows for a treat when they open their mouths and gulp down the flakes because nothing on earth tastes so sweet but then one dark day smoke blew in their way and the temperatures got higher on the horizon they saw fire and the waters did rise and the snow started melting away and the people weren t tearful nor fearful or scared because the secret was out there at last the secret was shared they watched as the ice turned to water and streamed down into the sea and lit up the ocean and crept in slow motion through the world they never did see and people in lands around the planet were in shock as the light came to shore and lit up the beaches and even their teachers couldn t say what the bright light was for it flowed upstream through the mountains burst out through their fountains breaking all life s natural laws till they lit up the planet and all who lived on it were touched by this magical force and they looked all around at the sky and at the ground and they realized what they had been seeing then as they started to cry their tears filled the sky and the black storm clouds gathered above and then the heavens opened and the rains came to show them that their world needs a little more love at the top of the world there s an island a place where the sun never shines but the people don t care because the snow over there is so bright the sun s in

to lie and since they don t represent the people and so since they act against the interest of the people the only way they can hold power is if they lie to the people you don t know what i know you can t see the spreading stain of deception i am cruel to myself things will never be the same if they told people the truth they wouldn t last very long i will hold my silence like a weapon in my hand if i used it i would murder myself you could never understand columbus came ashore greeted with nothin but niceness sailin west in attempt to find gold and spices dominated by the popes in frenzy for ices the catholic church expelled jews and claimed it was righteous the first man to see land would get a reward and get a yearly pension for life clearly from god a young sailor saw land said we isn t far columbus lied said he saw it the evening before they touched ground they were greeted by the arawak columbus had them locked up as prisoners in an hour flat he wanted to find their source of gold and that was that and when they thought that wasn t fair then he stabbed their back when there was no more gold he took slaves instead and left a quarter million indians in haiti dead the men died in mines the women died at work the children died from lack of milk and they died in the dirt they were just takin advantage of a passive people they were just bein the savages of massive evil that s the church work that s the path of massive ego that s the blood of abraham bein stabbed by the steeple  in 1619 they were patiently waitin for a ship that carried slaves that was changin the nation the white man was a cannibal prayin to satan hatred contempt a pity of patronization that s the cornerstone of everything racism based in the african had a more advanced civilization black was slave master was white rationalization fifty million dead that s western civilization at first they appeared in the north and they were helpless in the face of superior force and all of them were chained together they really was lost racism isn t natural it s merely divorce before the slave trade black was considered distasteful by the oxford dictionary i find it disgraceful it s not a natural tendency to be bitter and hateful it s the natural enemy of the critical staple slavery grew as the plantation system grew the reason for that s kinda easily traceable society of helpless dependence was capable of saying fuck a slave master you re in slavery too seven slaves were put to death for murderin master fear of slave revolt had them developin faster you a cataline killer ineloquent bastard i would burn the white man while smellin the ashes from time to time white man was part of the resistance white indentured servants wanted no part of the system king philip s war showed that if people would listen then they can maybe break the complex chain of oppression tyranny is tyranny but that s a concession but the women they was treated like that of possessions black women had it worse cause they was abused that s the white justification the aryan blues the next move was to dominate the mexicans james polk dominated them like they was next of kin he sent colonel cross to lie to them and let them in eleven days later his skull was crushed so message sent we take nothing by conquest that was the mantra the military wasn t human they was just monsters henry david thoreau refused to pay his taxes denounced the mexican war and got locked in shackles the twentieth century opened anger re emerged reality of ordinary life was bein heard anarchists and feminists came from factory work communism socialism seemed to be re birthed war is the health of the state is what bourne said and if you was born around that time you was born dead the espionage act had people confused cause it was double talk and they aint know how itd be used supposedly it was an act against spyin dubois knew that that was bullshit and they was lyin charles schenck was arrested in philadelphia for printin and distributin leaflets cause they was helpin ya he was indicted tried and then found guilty and spent six months in jail dont that sound silly had his freedom taken away by his own nation but theres a lesson do not submit to intimidation the act still exists today and this shit is real supposedly kennedy tried to have that shit appealed eugene debs did ten years for no purpose he obstructed the recruiting and enlistment service the post office started takin mail privileges of magazines who printed anti war sentiments a socialist named fairchild had it right he said that they can shoot me but they cant make me fight they sentenced him to a year in jail and that was reckless sixty five thousand men conscientious objectors they were sent to army bases to work there they were treated sadistically and were hurt there they were strangled with the hemp rope till they collapsed and officers punched they stomach and they lower back a garden hose was placed on they face with a nozzle about six inches from them so they couldnt swallow the war ended in nineteen hundred and eighteen the government was just tryin to wipe the slate clean hemingway wrote farewell to arms dalton trumbo wrote johnny got his gun the war was over but they didnt learn they lesson twin tactics of control reform and repression the patriotic fervor of war had been invoked thats why the country that you live in is a fuckin joke you cannot be neutral on a moving train this is a story about the lies that your teacher told you this is real actual factual no lies in the whole record if you dont believe me look it up im tryin to share the shit that i learned with y all do the knowledge your government does not care about you the people in power do not care about you understand that power to the people war is like a fix you know you get high on war we won we won and then you look down on the ground again and you need another fix you need another war why do you think weve had war after war after war after war every war they say this is the end this is the last war in world war i they said this is the war to end all wars and then not long after that was world war ii and then soon the

started feelin it even though i didn t know what scripture he was dealin with so i said let me stay and see then he said turn to isaiah 53 i m like aww yeah man that text is raw the very next thing he said made me drop my jaw i was appalled they offered him applause and 20 000 people screamin praise the lord dawg i m like naw i m laughin it off but it was serious he was speakin on behalf of god it s time press stop and rewind go back roll back right now with creeds and church history lets stop and see if we missed a beat he was reading verse 5 by his stripes we are healed then he said cause of that we should never get ill and if you do get sick its from a lack of faith this false teaching is really exasperating then he said either that or some secret sin so if your sickness comes back you need to seek him again confess your hidden sin and beseech him again and if you doubt your sickness will come creepin again so all that text was sayin is that we shouldn t get sick man is that in the bible that same preacher man said we suppose to be rich man is that in the bible he said with my faith i can confess and posses it is that in the bible then he said god s people shouldn t suffer is
