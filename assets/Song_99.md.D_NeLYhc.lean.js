my screws knocked loose in a fight cause i don t even remember how to aim down sights now that the training is done we re on a chopper to war captain noisy is yelling and telling us what we re here for the mission is critical with volition political i could question it but i ain t feeling too analytical cause a dude on a rooftop with an rpg just sent us spinning around 360 degrees like a pre pubescent sniper on 10 sensitivity i spin in circles with a bunch of dudes yelling at me cause i m the shooter guy shooter guy laws of physics and logic need not apply i m the shooter guy shooter guy as long as i got my wall i will never die 360 no scope triple collateral guys oh my god headshot bitch i m a sniper now the world it is fading and my vision s degrading through slow motion i m wading with the bad guys invading look around in a blur and see the bodies and blood get control of my legs again and crawl through the mud snipers on ledges wearing bulletproof apparel why are these idiots standing next to those flammable barrels red containers of death they make for easy kills they must spend a fortune on the fuel bill got a secret vacuum cleaner from my shirt to my pants sucks up ammo off the floor straight into my hands just gotta walk over bodies now i refill when i kill teabag your necrotic face for homoerotic thrills take a rocket to the face and a shot to the balls but it s okay i got my good friend chest high wall hiding in cover behind my wall i will hover and in a couple of seconds i will be fully recovered that s right soap so now i m right in the battle explosions roar and they rattle all of the grunts in my unit are getting slaughtered like cattle stupid morons keep on running out in front of my shots then they bitch at me for shooting them who programmed

launcher s lying conveniently on the ground boom goes the rocket that i pulled out of my pocket got an infinite stash and no armor s gonna block it now we got a locked door blocking the route but captain noisy has a key in the shape of his boot we go sneaking and a peeking through the enemy base into the fire we race bodies all over the place holding x is effective to achieve our objective get to the chopper is our final directive cause i m the shooter guy shooter guy i m a walking talking cliche this i can t deny i m the shooter guy shooter guy as long as i got my wall i will never die

had a dollar that i didn t earn with pride cause i had a million daydreams to keep me satisfied and will you gather daydreams or will you gather wealth how can you find your fortune when you cannot find yourself my mother s eyes grow misty there s a tremblin in her hand sit down young stranger i do not understand and will you try to tell us you ve been too long at school that knowledge is not needed that power does not rule that war is not the answer that young men should not die sit down young stranger i wait for your reply the answer is not easy for souls are not reborn to wear the crown of peace you must wear the crown of thorns if jesus had a reason i m sure he would not tell they treated him so badly how could he wish them well the parlor now is empty there s nothin left to say my

sunglasses he had on stage at the bowery ballroom had he come to walk among the williamsburgers of his kingdom and like the burghers of calais will a sacrifice be demanded to offer up our dreams and beg for mercy empty handed and hapless in our hipness crowded 5 to an appartment relegate our dreams to hobbies and deny our disappointment cause the stones in 65 want total satisfaction kid but the stones in 69 see grace in just getting what you need but if that s a victory then i d hate to see what i d look like defeated cause i know there are those among us who seem to get their dreams unimpeded today i went to major matt s to remaster my old album and on the l train in the morning i was really sure i saw will oldham he was wearin the same sunglasses he had on stage at the bowery ballroom had he come to walk among the williamsburgers of his kingdom and you might say now there s a guy who seems to have their world laid out before him or you might say he s just a rich kid or a fascist or a charlatan but either way you say it if you look at indie rock culture you really can t ignore him and even if at first dismissive after some listens you ll enjoy him i was thinking this on the l train intend on bursting my own bubble how long should an artist struggle before it isn t worth the hassle and admit we aren t fit to be the one inside the castle this quest for greatness or at least hipness just a scam and too much trouble but then what makes on human being worthy of an easy ride born to be a natural artist you love or hate but can t deny while us minions in our millions tumble into history s chasm we might have a couple of laughs but we re still wastes of protoplasm today i was gonna waste some time and money to remaster some dumb old album and on the l train in the morning i was really sure i saw will oldham he was wearin the same big sunglasses he had on stage at the bowery ballroom had he come to see the strife here in the gutters of his kingdom where us noble starving artists are striving to feed our ego our mothers like our music our our friends come to our shows and if our friends become successful we ll consider them our foes go home to our 4 roomates after payin big bucks for rockstars shows what a nightmare what a horror i don t want no part of this get me off this crazy ride i m gonna puke i m gonna piss i d rather kill myself i d rather just relax or not exist but you say you wanna do an e mail interview oh what the heck i can t resist hey ma guess what today i did another magazine interview honey that s great you re really famous yeah and i m 27 too i kinda thought i was gonna grow up to do stuff that would benefit humanity but it s getting harder to tell if this artist s life is even benefitting me cause i was gonna waste some time and money today to remaster some dumb old album and on the l train in the morning i was totally sure i saw will oldham he was wearin the same big sunglasses he had on stage at the bowery ballroom and since i was feeling in need of answers i just went right up and asked him i said will bonnie prince palace or whatever what do you think about it is it worth being an artist or an indie rock star or are you better off without it cause i mean maybe the world would be better if we were all just uncreative drones no dead child hood dreams to haunt us a decent job a decent home and if we have some extra time we could do real things to promote peace become scientists or history teachers or un corrupt police at least come on will you gotta tell me i grabbed and shook him by the arm the l train was leaving bedford with 10 000 white twenty somethings crowded on he opened his mouth to speak but it was lost in the rumbling of the wheels we were thrown together in a corner and i yelled tell me man for real you re living comfortably i assume even if you re not quite a household name you ve reached a pretty high level of success critical acclaim the l train got to first avenue and a bunch of people piled out i was starring into his sunglasses and i was really freakin out i was like steamboat willie bonnie prince of all this shit you re like the king of a certain genre but even you must want to quit like if you hear a record by bob dylan or neil young or whatever you must start thinkin people like me but i won t be that good ever and i m sure the thing is probably dylan himself too stayed up some nights wishing he was as good as ginsberg or camus and he was like dude i m such a faker i m just a clown who entertains and these fools who pay for my crap they just have pathetic punny brains and camus probably wished he was milton too or whatever you know what i m sayin so will will you be straight with me now that it s just us 2 on this train cause i was gonna spend some time and money today to remaster some dumb old album and i saw you here on the l train and i was like hey is that will oldham he must at least have some perspective cause it s like living in this town i get so confused wound up up tight and i just don t know up from down and then we d reached the last stop and the subway was deserted there was a long moment of silence and i let go of his shirt i started to think that maybe i d made some kind of big mistake i tried to walk out onto the platform but by then it was too late his sunglasses seemed to grow darker and still he hadn t even spoke he just came right up behind me and put his hand around my throat and threw me down onto the concrete and kicked my face in with his boot and dragged me down onto the train tracks and tied my hands back with his coat and i was slipping out of conciousness as he was slipping down my jeans and he was punching me and humping me and i slipped off into a dream so it might have just been a delusion but i thought i heard him say something like artists are pussies then he climbed back up and ran away so i lay there in the darkness on the train tracks cold and broken the hours passed and i thought well maybe i won t remaster that old album and then i started thinking maybe it really hadn t been will oldham even though he did hold my arms and fucked me just like will sings in a sucker s evening but whether it was him or not i couldn t forget the words he d spoken artists are pussies like we re wusses or we end up getting fucked and other kinds of folks are dicks tall smart and strong and born to

types of mental gender that s gone on in all societies in one form or another like some dicks were born to conquer i probably would if i could but if i m just a pussy that s okay cause in a few months

right cause christ was not his name that s greek for one who is anointed yeshua ben yosef was his name do christians know this so who do you praise do you know his name or do you do this in vain accepting the religion they gave slaves to behave peep the description of historian josephus short dark with an underdeveloped beard was jesus he had the romans fearin revolution the solution was to take him to court and falsely accuse him after being murdered by pilate how can it be these same white romans established christianity constantine would later see the cross in a dream in his vision it

god true indeed fuck it jihad in the eight century muslims conquered spain portugal and france and controlled it for 700 years they never mention this in history class cause ofays are threatened when you get the real lesson moors from baghdad turkey threatened european christians meaning the white way of life hence the crusades for christ on november 25th 1491 santiago defeats the last muslim stronghold granada king ferdinand gave thanks to god for victory and the pope of rome and declared this date to forever be a day of thanksgiving for all european christians now listen when you celebrate thanksgiving what you are actually celebrating is the proclamation of the pope of rome who later in league with queen isabella sent cardinal ximenos to spain to murder any blacks that resisted christianity these moors these black men and women were from baghdad turkey and today you eat the turkey for your thanksgiving day as the european powers destroyed the turkeys who were the forefathers of your mothers and fathers now fight the power bitch ass niggas now around this time whites started callin us negroes that s spanish for black object meaning we re not really people but property and the triangle trade begins they seize us queen elizabeth sends the first slaves on a ship named jesus stealin land from the indigenous natives gave them alcohol to keep the red man intoxicated whites claim they had to civilize these pagan animals but up until 1848 there s documented cases of whites being the savage cannibals eating indians in 1992 it s jeffery dahmer they slaughtered a whole race with guns drugs priests and nuns 1763 the first demonic tactic of biological warfare as tokens of peace sir jeffery amherst passed out clothing and blankets to the indian community infested with small pox knowing they had no immunity today it s aids you best believe it s man made cause ain t a damn thing changed let me explain now since people of color are genetically dominant and caucasoids are genetically recessive and whites expect to be predominant meaning survive as a race then they simply must take precautions that s why they re worried about their future now cause by 2050 almost all the earth s population will be brown then black so understandin that whites counter react so they created a system to force blacks into an unnatural position that re enforces the position of natural inferiority in addition created guns and developed the ethnocentric view that god justifies every fuckin thing they do condition people to perceive whites culture as civilized and every other culture considered primitive not true racism is the system of racial subjugation against non whites in every areas of human relation entertainment education labor politics law religion sex war and economics see blacks were 3 5ths of a man with tax purposes intended you think you re afro american you re a 14th amendment and a good nigga jews don t salute the fuckin swastika but niggas pledge allegiance to the flag that accosted ya they never teach about the break of islands like jamaica but before slaves came here whites would take a pregnant woman hang her from a tree by her toes slice her stomach with a knife and let the unborn baby fall to the flo and stomp an unborn child in front of all the slaves to inbreed fear so they d be scared and behave and not rebel more understand all whites must be perceived as potential predators i paraphrase historian ishakamusa barashango understand that regardless of the lofty ideas engraved on paper in such documents as the constitution or declaration the basic nature of the european american white man remains virtually unchanged so check this is the nature of the threat17","is_english":"True","genres_list":"","popularity":"","release_date":"","artist_id":"","artist_name":"","artist_popularity":"","artist_followers":"","artist_picture_url":""},{"Unnamed:
