Here’s a breakdown of how each works.</p><h3 id="_1-–-google-chat" tabindex="-1">1 – Google Chat <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-–-google-chat" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1 – Google Chat&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Google Chat was called Hangouts Chat and worked as a more business-oriented version of the consumer Hangouts. Google Chat expands on the features of the standard version of Hangouts by adding a plethora of team collaboration features and integrations.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/6622b330167c77f68aab9b71_Screenshot%202024-04-19%20at%202.08.39%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Google Chat"></p><h4 id="how-do-i-use-google-chat" tabindex="-1">How do I use Google Chat? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-use-google-chat" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I use Google Chat?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Google Chat is easily accessible in Google Workspace. To access it, use the Google app launcher button in any Workspace application.</p><p>The app launcher appears as a gridded set of dots along the upper right-hand side of your screen.</p><p>Click this grid, and a series of apps, including Gmail, Calendar, Contacts, and Drive, will appear.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/6622b79c2a0372fd7d427046_Screenshot%202024-04-19%20at%202.27.33%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt=""></p><p>Once selected, a list of people that you can chat with will be populated along the left side of the screen.</p><p>It’ll also provide you with data like presence information and whether specific colleagues are online. Click on the name to begin a conversation. Type in the intended message and click the send button, which is shaped like a triangle, to send.</p><p>Google Chat has some handy functions. The software uses predictive text options to automate replies. For example, if a coworker says, “Good afternoon,” Google will provide you a list of appropriate answers like, “Hello, how are you?”</p><p>Once a chat is established, you share spreadsheets and documents from Google Drive. Any participant will then be able to access the file via Google Docs.</p><p>Additionally, adding things like video meeting links is done very quickly through the chat UI. Once placed in chat, Google Chat will provide a clickable meeting for colleagues to use.</p><h4 id="how-do-i-get-the-google-chat-app" tabindex="-1">How do I get the Google Chat app? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-get-the-google-chat-app" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How do I get the Google Chat app?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>If you&#39;d like to use Google Chat on your desktop, you can also download the Google Chat app for a native experience separate from your browser.</p><p>To install the Google Chat app, follow these instructions.</p><ol><li><a href="https://chat.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sign in to Google Chat</a>.</li><li>Upon first using Google Chat, a pop up will appear with an option to download the desktop app.</li></ol><p>Click <a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/9455386?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for additional download tips or troubleshooting.</p><h4 id="is-google-hangouts-still-working" tabindex="-1">Is Google Hangouts still working? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-google-hangouts-still-working" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Google Hangouts still working?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>For those wondering if Google hangouts is still a thing, the answer is unfortunately not.</p><p>In 2022, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/hangouts-to-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">announced</a> that Google Hangouts would cease to be operational. The good news, however, is that users can use Google Chat and Google Meet to communicate via messaging and video.</p><p>According to Google,</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Google Chat is an intelligent communication app for teams that takes direct messaging in Google Hangouts and evolves it to reflect the way modern teams talk business.”</p></blockquote><p>Google Chat is the next evolution of Hangouts. It grants that same one-on-one communication but expands on it to be more effective in a business setting.</p><p>Important features available in Hangouts like read receipts, video and audio conferencing, and image sharing are all available through Chat.</p><p>In addition, more robust, collaboration-friendly features also come standard.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Spaces, direct messages, and group chats:</strong> Users can collaborate on every level, from 1:1 direct messages to company or team-wide spaces (the equivalent of channels in Microsoft Teams or Slack). Messaging features available include <a href="https://dispatch.m.io/message-threads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">message threads</a> for those looking to delegate individual tasks to specific team members, file collaboration, emojis, reactions, and everything else you would expect from a modern messaging platform.</li><li><strong>Larger Video Chat Capacities:</strong> With Hangouts, you were limited to 10 attendees, but Chat expands this thanks to its paid structure. With Chat, you’ll have a max of 250 participants for any video chat.</li><li><strong>Google Meet Integration:</strong> This is probably one of the better features of Chat. When you want to set up a meeting, you simply tag Google Meet with the meeting attendees. After that, you only need to mention the proposed meeting date, and the calendar appointment is automatically created.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-–-google-meet" tabindex="-1">2 – Google Meet <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-–-google-meet" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2 – Google Meet&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Video meetings technically aren’t native to Google Chat.</p><p>In fact, the core functionality is simple business chatting.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/6622b432e5c90d515f34feb1_Screenshot%202024-04-19%20at%202.12.59%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Google Meet"></p><p>Still, integration with Google’s meeting solution, Google Meet, is so well integrated into Chat that you’d be forgiven for thinking that it was all the same program.</p><p>Google Meet is still its own solution that provides you with the ability to hold HD video conferences and presentations.</p><p>Since this is integrated into Google Workspace, as long as you are within the Google ecosystem, it’s easy to start or schedule a meeting.</p><p>In fact, in most cases, you’ll have to share a link, so there’s no need for extra plugins, downloads, or any extra steps.</p><p>The software is also natively accessible when users are signed in on Chrome. With Meet, you can even share single tabs from the Chrome browser when you’re holding a presentation.</p><p>One of the newer features of Google Meet includes the ability to <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2020/09/blur-your-background-in-google-meet.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">blur your background</a>. This allows you to hold meetings where objects in the background won’t provide any unneeded distractions.</p><p>You can also <a href="https://www.hellobackgrounds.com/google-meet-backgrounds/?via=dominic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">add a virtual background</a> to replace your own background with something more formal or fun.</p><p><a href="https://www.hellobackgrounds.com/google-meet-backgrounds?via=dominic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/65d31e172be920e8726c749f_Microsoft-Teams-virtual-backgrounds.png" alt=""></a></p><p>Meet also has Google Jamboard integration, where you and your team brainstorm using a digital whiteboard.</p><h3 id="_4-–-google-workspace" tabindex="-1">4 – Google Workspace <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-–-google-workspace" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4 – Google Workspace&quot;">​</a></h3><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/65d31e3b78f3b7f667ac9e90_Google-Workspace.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Previously known as G Suite, Google&#39;s collection of workplace tools was rebranded as Google Workplace in Q3 2020.

This provides a unified experience for anyone looking to streamline processes and limit <a href="https://www.m.io/blog/context-switching" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">switching between tabs and applications</a>.</p><p>With Workspace, @mentioning someone in Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides will provide you with multiple methods to contact that colleague. This includes standard chat, video meetings, and email.</p><p>Workspace also bakes in search, which is something you might expect from a Google product. You can filter by project, team member, or app, and it displays results in real-time as you type.</p><h2 id="google-chat-pricing" tabindex="-1">Google Chat pricing <a class="header-anchor" href="#google-chat-pricing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Google Chat pricing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Google Chat, as a component of Google Workspace, is available in all pricing tiers of the parent product.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect as pricing for Workspace:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th></th><th>Business Starter</th><th>Business Standard</th><th>Business Plus</th><th>Enterprise</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Monthly Price per user</td><td>$6 USD</td><td>$12 USD</td><td>$18 USD</td><td>Pricing not published (<a href="https://workspace.google.com/contact-form" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google Sales</a>)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>30 GB storage per user</td><td>2 TB storage per user</td><td>5 TB storage per user</td><td>Unlimited</td></tr><tr><td>Video Meetings</td><td>100 participants</td><td>150 participants</td><td>250 participants</td><td>250 participants</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="google-chat-integrations" tabindex="-1">Google Chat integrations <a class="header-anchor" href="#google-chat-integrations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Google Chat integrations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As a product included in Google Workspace, there are several integrations included with Google Chat.</p><p>For example, out of the box, the software automatically integrates with solutions like Gmail, Google Forms, Google Calendar, Google Meet, Google Drive, and Google Docs.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/657ab76a5c0bbca529ce9a1e/6622b4babf58f2d14d28867d_Screenshot%202024-04-19%20at%202.15.15%E2%80%AFPM.png" alt="Integrations with Google Chat"></p><p>This is designed to reduce task-switching and to create an integrated workspace. With it, you can chat on one side of your screen and video conference on another – all in the same window.</p><p>In addition to these out-of-the-box integrations, Chat also will integrate with the popular third-party solutions that your company is using.</p><p>For example, there are several REST APIs that developers can use to integrate apps with a user’s mail, calendars, and contacts.</p><p>Don’t like Google Calendar? G Suite Sync will allow you to sync your calendar information with Microsoft Outlook.</p><p>This is convenient for businesses making the switchover from a Microsoft-based system to a Google-based one.</p><h2 id="is-google-chat-right-for-your-organization" tabindex="-1">Is Google Chat right for your organization? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-google-chat-right-for-your-organization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Google Chat right for your organization?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Google Chat is software that streamlines the way your teams communicate.</p><p>It’s simple to share information and documents and collaborate with hundreds of colleagues.</p><p>It’s an inexpensive option, especially if you’re already a Workspace subscriber.</p><p>Keep in mind that using the low-code app development options will increase the price somewhat for those looking to add integrations.</p><p>Google has also been expanding features to make it more comparable to industry leaders.</p><p>Features like linked previews in various Workplace apps and real-time collaboration on documents within chat rooms, which are features that have been recently announced, will go far towards this goal.</p><p>Now is an excellent time to be a Workspace subscriber.</p><p>But what if your enterprise already uses other chat platforms, such as Microsoft Teams and Slack?
