one way to do everything and that sin is only washable in a faith that s completely optional so i ll bleach all the skeletons that i have by the closetful and if the world is so colorful why do we

paradigm for hatred and if this life is what you make it i hope you like sleeping on your self built bed of nails chewing down your nail bed evil elegance blooms the apocalypse as we eclipse ourselves

dead pig i m thinking back to when i had a heartbeat and how i would act i would steal from the poor i d laugh at the sick but in the killing fields you get your fuckin neck ripped so as i walk along i meet a lot of strange folks some people with no eyes and gashed open throats and if they notice your eyeballs are working well they try to dig them out your skull and go for self now in the summertime it s like a whole other realm water becomes fire and oceans overwhelm to walk outside the heat will surely cook your brains try to run across the street your hair will burst to flames victims in a panic run from the heated light underneath the city into the sewer pipes until the fire s gone this becomes your new land but there s no food so you feed off the other men and now it s been seven months i m barely fed i chase a baby billy goat with a human s head it s steady screamin let me be let me be but while i chase it there s another demon chasing me all of time moves backwards i m growing old and still the clouds are burning fire and so i m told that there s a lot of living souls such as the rich that choose to live like a bitch i ll see you in the killing fields  come come on down down you ve had your big time of lust and sin and filth what is the end going to be come come on down down when you realize that time is up you ve crossed the finish line going in the wrong direction come come on down down what shall the end be what about it young man when you ve spent your life in a few years time come come on down down you re a burned out shell at twenty five

the game last night that ref should get his eyes checked wait a second parking garage in the afternoon vague and crappy dialogue we re about to find a dead body we never do and the best thing about law and order is that it s like the same episode every single time like it s the same thing again and again to the point where you see the same types of characters on every law and order they ll bust out the same types of people on different episodes some of my personal favorites there is guy who while being questioned by homicide detectives will not stop unloading crates doesn t matter to this guy double rape and murder nah he s gotta unload that van the detectives they ll show up with all these serious questions and this guy is just like tony ramirez yeah i remember him used to work here tuesdays it s like dude people have died how often are you questioned by homicide detectives other favorites on law and order there is judge who allows everything mmm i ll allow it watch yourself

they always make that face like their face needs to adjust to a photograph like oh a picture not for nutting but but for a second i thought it was a tiny person okay yeah blue shirt lady nice lady

certain dead relatives of mine he was the best jerry orbach for those of you that don t know who that is he played detective lenny briskoe on law and order for many many years he was a wonderful actor he also played the dad in dirty dancing he s the one who put baby in the corner but a few years ago jerry orbach died you may know that it was very sad what you may not knowand this is absolutely true by the way i would not shit you san francisco this is absolutely true after jerry orbach died he donated his eyes to the new york eye bank he was an eye donor okay and there s these signs all over new york that you can see and they re in ads and magazines and stuff and they say jerry orbach gave his heart and soul to the gift of acting and the gift of sight to two new yorkers two new yorkers got jerry orbach s eyes sorry like as a transplant not just to have they had them put in they got them surgically put in not just to carry around mushy like like a doctor did it that is an amazing story there s two different new yorkers walking around with jerry orbach s eyeballs what s more amazing is that it s two different people in new york city they are probably strangers they probably don t

airlines no one does guess who i also dont like small airlines very scary the small airline you know a couple months ago i got to fly out of a small airport in quincy illinois jealous and i got on a 20 person plane now you think you would trust a small plane more because it weighs less and flying is a war against gravity but i got on this plane and i was like holy shit if this thing crashes it

not saying it s a bad movie it is but that s not my point it s just like that i ve seen tons of people in the past who wear like knee long scarface t shirts like it s a flag or something like the guy from scarface is their hero i wonder if they ve seen the end of the movie because it ends really really badly spoiler alert scarface dies snorting a comical pile of cocaine in a tacky ass mansion that looks like if the golden girls won the lottery cause they won the powerball lottery also i don t like people lumping in scarface with better movies i have friends that ll be like yeah i love movies that are like the godfather and scarface oh yeah well my favorite foods are lobster and skittles those are equal in my eyes i also think it s weird in moves when someone has amnesia and they wake up in the hospital a lot of times they ll be surrounded by friends and family but when they open their eyes they go who are you because that s not how you act when you don t recognize somebody that s very rude it would be chaos out there if every time you saw someone you didn t recognize you went who are you i always try to be really polite in life so like if i had amnesia you d never know it i d wake up and they d be like hi john we re so happy you re awake and i d just be like oh hey man how s it going oh hey dude nice to see you again because that s how you act when you can tell that someone recognizes you and you have no fucking clue who they are i love movies though i m kindait s funny to me over the summer when these big blockbuster action movies come out and you read about one movie one of these movies and it ll say that it cost something like 100 million dollars because whenever i read that i think like yeah you didn t need to make a movie with that money i would have bought a ticket just to see 100 million dollars like i am at a point in my life where i would wait on a line just to look at that much cash like you could just stack it up in a motel room and line us up down the hall you put some guy out front in a straw hat that s like it is 8 dollars to see the 100 million or 10 dollars to have your money added to the 100 million ooh very luxurious but think about it that would be entertaining you know you d go into this room and there d be like stacks of hundred dollar bills and jewelry and gold coins spilling out of a pirate chest because pirates never

this grade school where they did this thing one year where they decided to divide all the kids up into two different math groups right based on your abilities and the first group that you could be in was called the blue angels and it was named after the famous aviators and the other group was called group 2 yeah oh we were a swell bunch of kids in group 2 the best part of it is we picked the name ourselves the teacher was like hey what are we gonna call ya group 2 and we were like yeah bingo you got it right there four and five is twelve and we re done for the day i went to a catholic grade school when i was younger and we had to learn a new bible story every single week and it was this bible study class although it wasn t called bible study class it was called religious studies we mainly studied one religion there wasn t a lot of like any hinduism or anything in there so you d learn a bible study like backwards and forwards and then we d like present on them at the end of the week and so a lot of them are still burned into my brain y know also there s like a lot of weird stuff going on in there like the story of king solomon and the baby do you guys remember that one if you don t i ll take you through the details so in the bible king solomon he s like the wise king of israel and these two women bring him a baby and they say king solomon we both claim that this is our baby what are you gonna do and solomon says well we will cut the baby down the middle and the first woman says oh okay and the other woman says no don t cut the baby down the middle and king solomon says to her ah ha ha ha congratulations you have proven yourself to be the real mother a couple things with that one who is this first woman that s like yeah cut the baby in half that sounds like a good idea like what kind of awful bitch has just stolen a bashe stole a baby and then the first time she s asked about it she s like look i ll take what i can get can i get the legs i ll take the legs she can have the top part she is so fucked up that she calls the head the top part secondly that he knew it was the real mother because she knows not to cut a baby in half yeah i think most people

then it has to outsource the job to my weird and feminine limbs and so when i play basketball it looks like i just bought my body like i don t know how it works yet but i played basketball i played basketball for five years and i was a bench warmer all five years i was i was a bench warmer for all five years and if you were never a bench warmer i cannot express to you the humiliations of every saturday morning putting on a pair of break away pants and never having a reason to break em away then they re just pants we would get in the game though for like the last thirty seconds they put you in the game for the last thirty seconds if we were winning so i got in the game once for the last thirty seconds i had to go half of one minute without doing anything wrong and i walk out on the court and i get fouled right away i get knocked to the ground so this referee runs over to help me up and he s like hey hey hey don t you worry son we re gonna get you some free throws and i was like oh no no no no no no no no no no no that will not be necessary if you are looking to make this up to me might i suggest a gift certificate of some kind oh and it was a uh it was a technical foul so they cleared the court they were like yeah you go on out there solo really explore the space with how much you suck at this game so if you were in the stands you could watch me shoot free throws and you could watch my team watch me shoot free throws and at that moment my team s bench it looked like some like bizarre last supper painting you know where the people are just like oh he s not gonna shoot free throws is he oh this is a really bad idea and my coach in the middle just like what the hell have you sent me i get up to the foul line and i air balled the first one but i did not air ball the second one because after you air ball the goal no longer becomes to make a basket it s just to hit some shit to show the people in the bleachers that you have a general sense of the game so i hit some shit bottom of the back board to be precise and that was my last year of basketball and at the end of the five years we had this big like sports awards ceremony where the woman in charge of all the teams got up to give a speech a very important speech that i ll never forget she got up there and she said uh you know programs like the boys basketball program are so important because the
