reaper help us jesus help to keep us away from all the sadness and deliver us from the hate that cause the madness i m glad it s installed in me from day one believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing and paying for it god bless your souls i ll be praying for it eventually you ll have your day in court and i done been a witness to homicide seen a whole family die before the stones of diamonds in the sky through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate that i ve trapped inside because the hurtin hard to ache there s a smile on my face but that s to keep a man from crying cause deep down inside i know i m dying i m born for it gon take some time to gettin used to and satan i know that your listening but i rebuke you and refuse to let you capture me and kill my will just to survive the game of life win or lose do or die refuse to let you capture me to kill my will to survive the game of life win or lose do or die whether we win or lose this life to do or die but sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why whether we win or lose this life to do or die but sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why open my hands like a book years and years me and my notebook i take a close look peep it dread see myself failing a felon on the verge of 1 8 7 but i ain t ever wanna do it cause homicide never solved it just momentarily resolved it we ve all been involved in the calling of a loved one oldest ones the young ones the smartest one the dum dums and not begun with some and they all probably died with none by the gun that s on the one two three

steve earle i ve spent my life following things i can not see and just when i catch up to them they slip away from me i ve been down a thousand trails i ve never walked before i found out that without fail they lead me to your door and the world keeps turning round and round it leaves me hanging in the air my heart keeps turning upside down and you re still standin there lately i see all the signs i feel it in the wind the same thing happens every time that you come back again i admit that there are nights when i sit up and cry but sometimes i turn out the lights and pray you ll pass me by and the world keeps turning round and round it leaves me hanging in the air my heart keeps turning upside down and you re still standin there since you re gone my empty arms have nothing left to hold and your memory cannot keep me warm but it never leaves me cold and the world keeps turning round and round it leaves me hanging in the air my heart keeps turning upside down and you re still standin there","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"pine i am calling to you aspen i am singing to you redwood hear this song birch bark weeping willow and dogwood blooming moonlight cedar let it fall fall away oak

brothers in your camp causing lots of confusion i love them as brothers in christ but not their conclusions they wanna reach the world by all means keep pursuing it but tell me why they gotta diss the
