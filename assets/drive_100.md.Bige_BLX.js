calling names like snivellus snape years later became a teacher master of the dark arts and i learned of james s death killed by lord voldemort also killed potter s wife her name was lily only one to survive was their child named harry they said he s the chosen one eventually in my class chosen by gryffindor he was a pain in my ass he was famous for surviving the spell for killing but clearly fame isn t everything professor severus snape with his long black cape head of slytherin house of the snake and half blood prince professor of defence potions master at hogwarts he s not a pleasant man and he seems like he s bad picking on harry potter in front of the class and though they debate he would do what it takes to protect this place he s severus snape  dumbledore and mcgonagall were fond of harry plus he had his friends hermione and ron weasley still there were some that didn t like him like me there was lucius and his son draco malfoy however i ll admit things started to get weird ever since harry potter started attending class here professor quirrell let in a troll at halloween never trusted him again then at the quidditch game harry s broom was bewitched it was quirrell i could see and i muttered a counterspell but his friends thought it was me they set fire to my cloak but his concentration broke and harry ended up catching the snitch and winning the game later on we found he was helping the dark lord living off of quirrell s body and the blood of unicorns trying to get the sorcerer s stone and get back a body of his own quirrell s death only slowed down voldemort me and lockhart had to teach the students defense against the dark arts once the chamber of secrets was opened finding petrified children caused by a basilisk harry found the diary of tom riddle who was voldemort back when he was little helped him find the chamber right in the middle of the school entered like a fool but he slayed the basilisk and i guess that s kinda cool a while later sirius black a prisoner of azkaban escaped across the land he s a bad man dementors from the prison circling the school looking for this fool this isn t cool we must be careful a few changes were made to the staff hagrid is a teacher now and dumbledore got a new hat also professor lupin using boggarts in his studies which is quite riddikulus if you think about that lupin s missing classes wondering where his ass is just so happens to be when sirius black is soon to attack and even though i d prefer to walk out the door turn to page 394 professor severus snape with his long black cape head of slytherin house of the snake and half blood prince professor of defence potions master at hogwarts he s not a pleasant man and he seems like he s bad picking on harry potter in front of the class and though they debate he would do what it takes to protect this place he s severus snape harry found a magic map that showed peter pettigrew pettigrew died years ago or so we know followed lupin into a tree and it appeared to me that he had been helping sirius black lately through some discussion we realize black was framed it was ron s rat scabbers who followed he who shall not be named pettigrew was an animagus and hiding for 12 years but then lupin saw the moon into a werewolf he changed pettigrew got away and after many days the ti wizard tournament started and students placed their names into the goblet of fire and then started the race underwater facing dragons then into a giant maze i noticed someone was stealing from my potion store to make polyjuice potion in order to transform didn t know who it was and i had no more but back to the tournament harry is leading the score he heads into the maze with cedric diggory and then he sees the cup it s a portkey takes them to a place with pettigrew he killed diggory traps harry had a ceremony and he brought back the dark lord harry got away barely with the portkey brought him back to the game and we all see harry is taken aside by mad eye moody he tried to kill him and when we realized he started changing barty crouch jr was the one stealing from me and he assumed the identity of moody after time went by we began training to prevent voldemort from controlling harry while he s protected by the order of the phoenix dumbledore has a plan for me to be a double agent wants me to kill him to gain voldemort s trust protect harry from within so i ll do what i must entangled with the death eaters bellatrix lestrange and lucius malfoy planning on having draco do the same when the time came in the tower everybody saw the unforgivable curse avada kadavra and through dumbledore s secret plan i ve lost all of my good friends surrounded by evil people capable of so much death giving harry time to destroy horcruxes while the dark lord weakens war breaks out and they defend from enemy forces voldemort believes that the elder wand serves me i m attacked by his snake nagini i am dying harry finds me and i let him see he saw the plan and the day his parents were taken away his mother lily and that i loved her always professor severus snape with his long black cape head of slytherin house of the snake and half blood

i don t know is this acting help help ridiculous well like i was talking about music i like music a ton but like the problem is i like weird stuff i like weird crazy music like weird people making music and we really don t have that anymore i mean we have lady gaga and stuff like that but that s i don t think that s really weird i feel like it s plain we need weird stuff cause like as an adult we re not really allowed to be weird anymore like the older you get the less you can take weird stuff that s the truth like you can t take weird stuff anymore as a kid the idea of santa claus is really weird and fucked up it really is but like just like hey there s this fat guy and he comes to your house eats all your food and he leaves little gifts for you while your parents are sleeping he runs up to timmy and like he gives me gifts cool you re just fine with it you re fine with that guy being in your house as an adult somebody s like hey man glee comes on at 9 instead of 8 tonight fuck you really why d they change it why d they change it can t take any change whatsoever but that s basically what it is it s like i m 27 and i m about to become who i m gonna be for the rest of my life like basically like once hit your thirties that s who you re gonna be for the rest of your life pretty much if you re a conservative and you re around your thirties you re probably gonna be a conservative for the rest of your life if you re like liberal and in your thirties you re probably gonna be liberal for the rest of your life if you re a girl and you don t get blowjobs curl up to your nine cats and your twilight dvds cause you re gonna die alone you re gonna die alone sorry i love that joke because guys are like well put mr glover but it s true you can t take any like as you get older you can t take any weird stuff that s just the truth like i you know that lady gaga kanye west tour i was super stoked about that that was gonna be so awesome and weird it s gonna be so crazy i was having dreams about it that s how much i was excited i was having dreams about it i was like there s gonna be two big pillars on stage like one big pillar here lady gaga s there and her hair is blowing in the wind and she s playing the bass like that but the bass isn t a bass it s a huge tampon just plucking at a huge tampon and at the end of it is tony danza s face he s just like ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba like he s just going crazy on it and like there s another one there s like another huge pillar and then like kanye west is on it he s playing the piano but the piano is not a piano it s just a bear it s a live bear for some reason and the bear is not eating kanye because he has so much respect for him he s just looking at him like aw i wanna eat you but you made graduation you mothafucka he s like mad and then like in the audience there s a big clear beach ball that everybody is pushing and kicking around and in the center of the big clear beach ball there s just this one lone baby just like one lone naked baby and he s not crying or anything he s just confused and shit like why did my parents put me in here i thought they loved me and i was like yes that s worth 50 wanna see that and they cancelled it they got rid of it they were like it s too weird it s gay get rid of it but they got rid of it they cancelled it and that s ridiculous that s crazy only adults would do that like as a kid we watched the weirdest stuff and nobody cared nobody ended you guys remember muppet babies let me refresh your memory what muppet babies is about muppet babies is a show about a lady with no face who takes care a frog a pig a dog that plays the piano and an alien named gonzo that fucks chickens and adults were like yeah watch it i don t give a fuck i got things to do gotta go you guys remember teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles teenage mutant ninja turtles sounds like a homeless person s fever dream if you were walking down the street and

they re both expensive you have them for the rest of your life they re constant reminders of the mistakes you ve made and once you have them you pretty much can only date other people who have them what s the difference what s the difference the only difference is you can t go to jail by accidentally dropping aids so aids wins by this much i m serious i mean like people at least people when you have aids people are like aware of it and people want to help you people feel sorry for you like people want to help you out and make other people aware of that when you have aids people don t give a shit when you have kids no one s just like yeah man i m livin with kids been kids positive for about five years now i lost a lot of my friends in the 80s to kids we re just uh we re doin a kids walk tomorrow and just i m sorry one of my kids coughed in my face i have to leave like no no one cares and it s weird like i remember here s i was babysittin this kid once this mean kid i remember and i remember the first time i saw him i opened the door and there were tears streaming down his face tears streaming down his face but he wasn t crying he wasn t crying just tears he was givin me this mean mug he was like i was like what the fuck is wrong with this kid what s goin on with this kid i found out later that his parents were very organic and they wouldn t let him have any sugar they wouldn t let him have any candy he would the sweetest thing he was allowed was mints he was just allowed to have mints so he would steal mints by the handful so his breath was so fresh the vapors from his own mouth made his eyes water like he d be like hello like just they would just bleed wha wha it was crazy i would take him to the park right washington square park and all the babysitters in new york for some reason are trinidadian they re all trinidadian babysitters and i would take him to the park and i was the only boy there you know i was the only hangin out you know they were cool you know we d trade jerkchicken recipes and stuff and he he was just a mean spirited kid like he kind of like he watched hbo just a little too early and was just kind of a mean kid in general so he would just come through and just he wanted to get to his slide so he just pushed over this little girl she fell over and her trinidadian babysitter comes over and goes ayy you leave that little girl alone and he goes shut up and she goes don t you talk to me like that i am a grown up you will respect me and he goes suck my dick and the lady goes i shit you not the lady goes someone betta get this

really affect me like i m sure it does like it used to like i don t really think about it it doesn t really come up and like i don t really care about that shit but like it still comes up in weird places like i like like ii write raps so sometimes i will write them in my iphone so i was like writing you know the n word in my iphone n i g g a i was writing the n word and my iphone goes did you mean niggardly and i was like no iphone i meant nigga write it but then like like two weeks later i was writing jigga which is the shortened form of jay z j i g g a and my iphone goes did you mean nigga and i went whoa iphone you do not get to say that i like to i like you know i ve said this in my raps before i like to date the black girls of every culture you know aren t you know like filipinos they re like thethe black girls of asians armenians who s like the black girls of white girls and i was datin this armenian and someone s racist uh armenians oh god but seriously who were you dating i was no i was dating this armenian girl and um wewe werewe were m m making sex uh i was having sex with her i ju i know i shou i wish i could start every sentence that way just like um i was having sex with this girl and enjoy black swan i liked that i liked the part where he said he was having sex but i was having sex with her and we were towardstowards the end and she goes fuck me harder with that n word dick and i stop look at her right in the eye and i came harder than i ve ever come before it was so awesome you guys it was so great like i was like wha like i couldn t believe it like it was almost worth being black my entire life it was so great i it was so great i actually felt bad for white dudes i felt bad i was like you guys ll never have that you ll never have that what do you guys have cracker dick that s not that s not sexy at all that sounds like a virus you pick up on a cruise ship like yeah you ve got cracker dick yeah just hold it together i don t know people always want to know who can say the n word and who can t say the n word you know like people always like i ve got a lotta you know i got a lotta white friends and they re all just kinda like oh you know oh man i wish i could say that stuff that sounds so cool when you say it in rap song like i want to say that it sounds cool and i m just like eh it doesn t really like do anything it s not that great you know like it still comes up in weird places like you know like that niglet joke i told that joke in alaska and alaska for some reason has a large deaf population so they hired a woman to do sign language with me for that joke and she comes up to me and she goes i m sorry but are there any terms or phrases in your act that don t exist in sign language that i have to make up on the spot and i was like yeah niglet and she goes oh there s already a term for niglet in sign language they already have it deaf people have been saying niglet for years for years a nigga that is tiny that s what that means was it why is this nigga why is this this is i feel like it should be or way way before this i ve done this walking down the street like when my nose itches i ve done that and i feel like deaf people were looking at me like that motherfucker s racist that guy hates his own people but like i was saying people always want to know who can say it and who can t and it doesn t help me it doesn t help anyone like it doesn t like being black and being able to say like the n word doesn t help at all like no one s ever i m not gonna get a job off of it or anything like that it s like this dude is extremely qualified for this job but this guy can say nigger whenever he wants which one do we choose like no one cares but there is one person in the entire world i know for a fact who can say the n word who isn t a minority there s one person there s one dude there s one dude in the entire world who can say the n word and he s not a minority he s not black and that one person in the entire world who can say the n word is charlie sheen why does charlie sheen get to say the n word donald i will tell you audience the reason charlie sheen gets to say the n word is because charlie sheen before all this crazy stuff happened two years ago got in a fight on the phone with his ex wife denise richards and just straight up called her a nigger just called her just called her the n word like literally he was like listen here you nigger like really really gave it to her and i m sorry give that man the naacp award that is seriously that is amazing think about it a white dude called a white woman a nigger straight up he didn t say like i hope you get raped by or something like that you know he didn t mel gibson it like he just totally just called her i m sorry and that s amazing that really is an amazing thing like think about it like see black people use the n word for everything we use it for everything like mother brother sister like love hate we use it for everything i called a seat belt a nigger earlier today i called a seat belt the n word i was putting on the seat belt and i was like nigga if you don t i called it it just needs a little flavor so i gave it the n word you never like we use it for everything you never see any other minority you never see white people just using it you never see that just using it for everything like you ll never go in ikea and see like two white undergraduates from nyu just holding just holding up some like rugs and being like what do you think of this rug denise i hate green oh stop being a nigger what do you think you ll never see that you ll never see that and that s the problem it has to become a bad word for everybody i hate it when black leaders are just like oh we re getting rid of it everybody s got to stop saying it no one like rappers will still say it because you told them not to that s what makes them badasses like you got everybody s got to start saying it everyone like white people like you guys have got to start saying the n word you guys gotta start saying it we will lose some of you in the process not all of you will make it home but you ll be dying for a good cause it ll be great i saw a lot of white people here just like no i would never uh uh not me i won t be doing that i will never i would never do that and let s be honest white people have been getting pretty bold with the n word lately anyway like seriously i was at a kanye west concert i was at a kanye concert the other day right i was at a kanye concert and he was doing all the lights and you know how all the lights starts he does like three three parts of a verse and then he gets to the end and then he holds the mic out for the n word part and everyone was like nigger like everyone everyone and i was in i wasn t in detroit i wasn t in south africa i was in texas where they make white people i was surrounded by white people and i was like what the hell just happened and they all looked at me like what you gonna do it s a kanye concert we outnumber you","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"it was so ridiculous i like like cause like cause you know that stuff is important to you when you re a kid that stuff

laugh in the snow and rain i get a buzz from being cold and wet the pleasure seems to balance out the pain and so you see that i m completely crazy i even shun the south of france the people on the hill they say i m lazy but when they sleep i sing and dance some people have to have the sultry evenings cocktails in the blue red and grey but i like every minute of the day i like every minute of the day2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"one two three and four one two three four evelyn i hope this can t be true evelyn you know my heart s with you don t try to tell me there s another boy oh oh don

believe after all these years you didnt know me any better than that sweet lady idiot wind blowing every time you move your mouth blowing down the backroads heading south idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth youre an idiot babe its a wonder that you still know how to breathe i ran into the fortune teller who said beware of lightning that might strike i havent known peace and quiet for so long i cant remember what its like theres a lone soldier on the cross smoke pouring out of a boxcar door you didnt know it you didnt think it could be done in the final end he won the war after losing every battle  i woke up on the roadside daydreaming about the way things sometimes are visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are making me see stars you hurt the ones that i love best and cover up the truth with lies one day youll be in the ditch flies buzzing around your eyes blood on your saddle idiot wind blowing through the flowers on your tomb blowing through the curtains in your room idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth youre an idiot babe its a wonder that you still know how to breathe it was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart you tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasnt enough to change my heart now everythings a little upside down as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped whats good is bad whats bad is good youll find out when you reach the top youre on the bottom i noticed at the ceremony your corrupt ways had finally made you blind i cant remember your face anymore your mouth has changed your eyes dont look into mine the priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone faced while the building burned i waited for you on the running boards near the cypress trees while the springtime turned slowly into autumn idiot wind blowing like a circle around my skull from the grand coulee dam to the capitol idiot wind blowing every time you move your teeth youre an idiot babe its a wonder that you still know how to breathe i cant feel you anymore i cant even touch the books youve read every time i crawl past your door i been wishing i ve been somebody else instead down the highway down the tracks down the road to ecstasy i followed you beneath the stars hounded by your memory and all your raging glory i been double crossed now for the very last time and now im finally free i kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me youll never know the hurt i suffered nor the pain i rise above and ill never know the same about you your holiness or your kind of love and it makes me feel so sorry idiot wind blowing through the buttons of our coats blowing through the letters that we wrote idiot wind blowing through the dust upon our shelves were idiots babe its a

island to survive drink up dreamers you re running dry when the flood calls you have no home you have no walls in the thunder crash you re a thousand minds within a flash don t be afraid to cry at what you see the actors gone there s only you and me and if we break before the dawn they ll use up what we used to be lord here comes the flood we ll say goodbye to flesh and blood if again the seas are silent in any still alive it ll be those who gave their island to survive drink up dreamers you re running dry","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"la fotografia di quel giorno in cui col sorriso tuo s

somethin for fuckin me yo everything was cool but vicky concerned me her husband was the district attorney so before he found out he was crossed up by his bitch i was fuckin i had her tossed up and put to sleep so a nigga never forgets a dead bitch can t tell a nigga shit one less bitch you gotta worry about she s outta here and that s how it turned out one less one less one less bitch you gotta worry about  thinkin about money and lookin at a prostitute the bitch was cute so now i had to execute and shoot game like a real nigga with a steel trigga convince her to move up to somethin bigga i think i had a flashback though cause i said fuck it loped and choked and smoked to the ho like this bitch it s all about dre the money money money and this all i gotta say of course she came with me and remained with me till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be workin that trick shit cause niggas knew that she was short one a little later though she caught one in the chest and i knew that it was commin by who and how the all act would be done so what one less bitch i gotta worry about but that ain t how it turned out yo there was a bitch named her out and shot her straight to the muthafuckin trigger and said i got her but i had better plans to give her the blues like dumpin her in the river with cement shoes i knew my money was comin up short and the thought that the stupid bitch thought she d never get caught came home early and straight bust her ass on the couch with her other nigga countin my cash i should ve known she was like them other hoes i told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes butt naked nothin left but the shoes i had up a nine so they couldn t refuse i shot the nigga he was outta there and tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin chair now there s one less bitch i gotta worry about everybody out that s how it turns out one less one less one less bitch you gotta worry about in reality a fool is one who believes that all women are ladies a nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches and all bitches are created equal to me all bitches are the same money hungry scandalous groupie hoes that s always ridin on a nigga s dick always in a nigga s pocket and when the nigga runs out of money the bitch is gone in the wind to me all bitches ain t shit one less one less one less bitch you gotta worry about

with a rapper but the pussy was more fishy than red snapper but how many licks would it take she asks to make mc ren start gooshin up vanilla shakes she took her tongue out her mouth put it on top like a cherry started movin it like a snake and it was very irresistible i couldn t pay the bitch to quit cuz the ho was doin some ol crazy shit that made me start havin a fit cuz the bitch sucked a hellified dick it s the world s biggest dick don t matter just don t bite it it s the world s biggest dick don t matter just don t bite it don t matter just don t bite it yeah  now one night i was at a drive in and a car full of niggas straight drove in i thought they wuz commin to start trouble but no five niggas in the bucket with the neighborhood ho now what do you expect they re gonna dog her
