in my sleeping mind the words inside my skull at night but once i wake i cannot read them my bloody hands remain a question mark sifting through the hiccups of time we ll hide in the bones of the city the engines sing along with their cries this song it spells disaster but it s buried beneath the laughter the words that fall from out their mouths can change in your hands and split the skin so i will keep myself apart from shining eyes and privileged boredom the thing that i ve learned from unusual blood is never touch a person s comfort the voice of change is often heard but fear itself has come to visit sifting through the hiccups of time we ll hide in the bones of the city the engines sing along with their cries this song it spells disaster but we drown it out with laughter and our eyes they were always pointed at the sky looking for an answer and our hands they were stained in black and grey busy solving problems and our backs all bear the load of all the things we ll never know until it breaks us and in the comfort of the earth we will not wonder what we re worth no we will sleep soundly all along the road to nowhere2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m that nigga same

spend some time with you so then i sat there reeling and looking at the ceiling words can t express the way that i was feeling then i thought to myself the sure way to get her is to write another note oh yes a love letter when i finished the note it was ready to pass the teacher took it and read it right in front of the class she read it word by word and line by line and everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine even then my girl was laughing and it was too late for me to write another note cause there would be no date the teacher looked at me and i said i know it s off to the principal s

well lay them low so everyone will know and well see one in all with blinding sight cause the silence doesnt seem so golden when theres nothing that you love and what you have wont feel like freedom if what you have is not enough and somewhere i know that theres a reason why this emptiness can way a ton and outside theres a breeze that blows so sweetly to return the many back to one cause the

with the bestest breasteses the size of texas and she was the queen of estrogen white black puerto rican and mexican and she sat next to you in third period she powdered her face but her skin had no flaws her tits looked like she wore three wonderbras thank god for that math book you put on your lap to cover up your jeans when your dick got hard i mean she was amazing i m not playing you were like 14 but she was still the kind of girl you wanted a baby with and i could tell the way that she would rock them pants that a lot of dudes hit it but she wanted a chance you talked to her but she gave you the shoulder she was the type of girl that was cold as boulder she d only mess with ya if you drove a rover what i push well fuck it let s just say a bucket ok anyway one day i rocked a show and i see her right there chilling up in the front row next time i go to my math class for sho she s talking about hey yo bro i didn t know that you flowed hey yo what s up with that cd maybe we could

classes and used to wear glasses with braces that accented her pimples that weren t really attractive but she was good in spanish and let you cheat off her answers but when you d see her in the hall you would walk right past her you acted like a bastard and never treated her right cause her body wasn t buckling and her face wasn t tight well guess what see that beautiful girl with the big butt

good man to me any day of the week tell the boys all no that you just can t go no tonight it s just my baby and me be a good man to me i understand if it s not in your way to go doting around on a lady all day but the simplest thing that would make my heart ring well you don t even think to do it so if it s too much to be given enough to keep the sparkle alive i guess that we tried everything that we could to keep our love going good and i d like to think i m better for it how can i be the one that cries for you unless you love me true how can i be the one that lets it slide unless you take the time to be a good man to me any day of the week tell the boys all no that you just can t go no tonight it s just my baby and me be a good man to me and if you did ever really love me then it wasn t in vain cause what s a girl without a broken heart and some baggage to claim when she climbs on a plane i don t mind doing dishes at night picking up all your mess that you re leaving behind

seems he didn t like my face and i quickly learned that prussia was an evil place they tied me to a chair with a giant clip and held a piece of paper to my tender nip then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack and told me not to worry cause they d soon be back but i loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed and ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed singing oh wilson someday i ll kill you til you die oh wilson punch you in the eye when wilson knew that i was loose i d surely be subjected to some real abuse maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree so angrily i paddled to the open sea but the sea was eager to beat me back and the waves grew huge and deadly black and the gray clouds rumbled over my head and i feared in my heart that i d soon be dead when the morning came and the storm had passed and the dismal fog began at last to open up before my eyes and there i saw to my surprise chains and specks of islands curved where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved and i parked my kayak on a stone and yelled across the ocean to his evil throne i said oh wilson someday i ll kill you til you die oh wilson punch you in the eye wilson kill you til you die oh wilson

pushed off to sea i stood on the shore looking forward tongue tied and stubbornly holding tears behind my eyelids because no matter how much i liked you girl there was still a bit of boy in me and i wasn t about to weep with you staring back smiling i guess this is goodbye i knocked on every inch of this wooden tree house to keep that word away but goodbye despite all of my efforts remains this
