baskin in this confidence that was new to me and it worked beautifully a wild night became a quiet ride home as i broke the silence her eyes roamed 7 years of frustration then hit her ears with abrasion as i laced her with my tale of lust tears and anticipation her reaction was a face of fakeness told me she was flattered but within a tone lacking any amazement it seemed she d heard it all

consists of building a spliff up or drinking till we stop thinking and drift off anything to escape the feeling stressful weeks played into hazy weekends tryna shake the demons of wasted seasons a long way from younger days spent dreaming of what we could be the possibilities were endless now we got responsibilities to contend with chasing wrong agendas running round in circles living our lives showing a lack of virtue like hip hop far from what they claim in a verse its either it feels like we changed for the worse wish i could go back to the best days on the earth chorus what happened to the days back then when la gears were the latest trend wed sit in the park all day sipping on our lemonade verse 2 back then i guess it was less complex cereal and cartoons wondering whats on next now were so far removed and its all a contest and theres too much to do and worries on our chest back then there was no stress listening to cassette tapes and lay in my house was known as the rest day didnt have to think about needing to get paid as things rearrange i guess you learn to accept change those were the best days sipping um bongo girls in the park playing how does the song go bright colored ponchos sitting in the treetops wearing high knee socks with black cover freeze pops nowadays i feel lost i guess time changes from thinking you could be anything like power rangers now its all faded friends become strangers we strive to escape this and who can really blame us chorus what happened to the days back then when la gears were the latest trend wed sit in the park all day

be amused as i watch the looney tunes think of something cool to do like fly in a spaceship brought back to earth by the thought of a pay slip used to be a crazed kid imagining great places greener trees better scenery and smiling faces verse 4 as time races life seems less enticing i used to love watching wwf at night then hulk hogan got replaced by mike tyson moved from high tecs onto white nikes and back in the day we used to like fighting that was messing around but now he might knife him its quite frightening the way things changed i wish that they couldve stayed the same chorus what happened to the days back then when la gears were the latest trend wed sit in the park all day sipping on our lemonade i wish we could go back to the easy times when we didnt need rhymes and i wish we could go back where the skies were bright and everything seemed nice now i wish we could go back to the easy times when we didnt need rhymes and i wish we could go back and i wish wish wish

pleasure to be here man and i thought it d be dope to kinda chop it up about certain terms that we throw out a lot but never really define so why don t i throw out some terms and you can give us the definition alright let s do it alright let s start it off with who is god god is the universe s creator and sustainer plus the only savior there is no one greater he triune holy omnipotent omniscient absolute loving sovereign and righteous are a few of his attributes how do we know this well we know this from the bible where god has revealed himself anything else is just an idol what s the bible about man s complete ruin in sin and what god has done in christ to bring us to him again what is sin sin is the breaking of god s law plus our condition which means from birth we all got flaws what s the result the result is by nature we re god s enemies and must pay the penalty unless god provides the remedy what the remedy the remedy is the cross of christ where he suffered all the strikes for the lawless type i ve been rescued by the lamb i m convinced that he s risen and blessed is the man whose sins are forgiven just fall back and with the eyes of faith behold the beauty of surprising grace because the lamb has died third day he had to rise he s magnified god s wrath is satisfied so fall back there s an atonement now the cross of christ is holy ground because the lamb has died third day he had to rise he s magnified god s wrath is satisfied regeneration the holy spirit s true work in his love to the elect who receive new birth from above expiation expiation means god s removed my filthiness the old testament type was the goat into the wilderness redemption we ve been freed from slavery to sin and his very own blood is the price he paid my friend propitiation propitiation means since the lamb has died his work is finished god s wrath is satisfied adoption adoption means god is now my father i got the hottest poppa and by the spirit holler abba reconciliation means there s no more enmity god is now a friend to me we re no longer enemies justification god declares us righteous sanctification we re being made into his likeness glorification that s what happens at the finish when god conforms believers perfectly to christ s image just fall back and with the eyes of faith behold the beauty of surprising grace because the lamb has died third day he had to rise he s magnified god s wrath is satisfied god s grace is magnificent he slayed his innocent son through faith and repentance we get the benefits what is faith faith is a gift from god when we receive this we trust and treasure the person and finished work of jesus repentance repentance is turning from your sin and trusting christ as the spirit cleanses you within what is grace oh grace is unmerited favor our inheritance major cause we cherish the savior right and if i may quote again we were doomed with satan but believers get jesus righteousness through imputation imputation god takes jesus righteousness amount through faith he credits it into the christian s account anything else well i guess this overview must suffice but none of this is possible apart from union with christ and finally once you know the ways of the lord than the only thing that you can say is soli deo gloria just fall back and with the eyes of faith behold the beauty of surprising grace

others but my envy is a reflex of my ignorance cause i don t know the details of their daily existence i just assume the weight i carry is the heaviest but i ve never been a heavweight my legs get heavy when i wait hope deferred so i prefer the immediate and exchange the true god for what seems more expedient it s meaningless  i cant always rely on my desires but i treat them like the messiah i cant always rely on my desires but i treat them like the messiah help us not be haste when it comes to temporal blessings and always see them for what they re actually meant to be a mere extension of your love and kindness extended to an undeserved humanity help us not see greater value in the gifts you give and not become distracted from their intended desires may we regard the world and all that is in it as nothing compared to the satisfaction of knowing our messiah8","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"praise god the father the immortal creator for your glory you made us you re the sovereign

birthday the little ogre s parents sat him down to talk just as all ogre s parents had for hundreds of years before listen son you re growing up so quickly growing up bigger by the day although we want you here the rules are very clear now you re seven now you re seven so it s time to go away your mama packed a sandwich for your trip your papa packed your boots in case of snow you re gonna make us proud no backing up allowed just keep walking just keep walking  and you ll find somewhere to go it s a big bright beautiful world with happiness all around it s peaches and cream and every dream comes true but not for you it s a big bright beautiful world with possibilities everywhere and just around the bend there s a friend or two but not for you we re ugly son which means that life is harder people hate the things they cannot understand and when they look at us they tend to make a fuss burn our houses down and chase us off our land it s important that you find a cozy cesspit a place no one would ever dare to tread and if they happen by make sure you terrify them if you don t son if you don t son then you ll surely wind up dead good bye good bye watch out for men with pitch forks and so the little ogre went off and found a muddy patch of swampland far far away from the world that despised him and there he stayed for many years tucked away and all alone which was just the way he liked it keep your big bright beautiful world i m happy where i am all alone i got all i need so read the stinkin sign keep your big bright beautiful world i party on my own anyway doin what i can with a one man conga line yeah your big bright beautiful world is all teddy bears and unicorns take your fluffy fauna and shove it where the sun don t shine i prefer a life like this it s not that complicated sure i m fated to be lonely and i m destined to be hated if you read the books they say it s why i was created but i don t care cause being liked is grossly overrated who needs a big bright beautiful world i got my own little patch of the world it s not a big bright beautiful world but it s mine alone it s mine and it s mine all mine","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"princess i how s

crime dehumanizing is how i justify it so i must keep on lying about the history of africa so i can live the with massacres and repeat my mantra of muslim and terrorist so i can sleep at night as bombs take flight eyes open wide but i m blind to the sight too busy chasing the perfect life and the working class keep them uneducated truly educated men could never be a racist to educate is to draw out what is within are we not all the same under the skin i got a heart like yours that pumps blood and oxygen and insecurities are a whole lot of them i m scared like you deep down i really do care that world is not fair like you but i don t even believe my own prayers like you chasing career going nowhere like you lost in a fog of my own insecurities i hold myself up as an image of purity and i judge everybody else by the color of their skin or the size of their wealth but it s not good for my health as the only one i ever really judge is myself the oppressor must suffer like the oppressed though i pretend i m in control of this mess by inflating my ego puffing my chest i see my weakness and need to show strength or what we think strong is because if we re honest true strength is the strength to be honest and if i m honest i am just tired if i m honest i am just tired tired of everyday filling up my car and knowing that i m paying for the bombs in iraq tired of pretending like it don t hurt my heart of wanting change but not knowing where to start tired of listening to all the conditioning and all the forms they got me filling in next time you see what is a thug and despise him please know i was just like him cause i was like eight the first time i saw crack same time i first smoked weed choking on blowbacks first time i saw knifes penetrate flesh it was meat cleavers to the back of the head as i grew and teenage years passed many more knifes pierced and the shots blast and i not saying i had the worst upbringing but there s a million young men just like me in prison we complain about racism and elevate clowns with their trousers down swinging their dicks round maybe that is not quite literal but everything they do is just as stereotypical to my real fans i feel your pain and i get the messages but don t complain that we ain t got more fame for paying our part they can keep the charts all i want is your hearts they can keep the charts all i want is your hearts they can keep the charts all i want is your hearts calling it black radio don t make laugh so is black music all about tits and arse you don t represent nothing you re just pretending when was the last time you ever played hendrix or miles davis or john coltrane or ella fitzgerald or billie holiday we can call it urban to me that s cool if urban means street that includes jazz too and rock for that matter go ask mick jagger or jimmy page what they were listening to the blues not discrediting love zeppelin too just giving credit where credit is due that blood soaked word rappers still use all it really shows is that we still self abuse that was the word that was used to kill kelso cochrane and emmett till that was the word that the conscience eased and made people pleased to hung you from trees that was the word that let the whips crack no matter what you say you can t take it back and i can say their black so i feel their pain easier but 1915 look at armenia if the whole world is human stupidity though we choke ourselves to death quite literally and i can talk with my comfortable mouth with my comfortable clothes and my comfortable house the tables will turn we can but stall them every empire on this earth has fallen so unless we can find another way maybe not today but it will come one day it may sound like i m bitter but in fact truth be told i am quite the opposite i wake everyday and am overwhelmed just to be alive and be like no one else and the sheer weight of the thought of space is enough to keep my little ego in place all that we chase and try to replace all along it was right in our face the only way we can ever change anything is to look in the mirror and find no enemy the only way we can ever change anything look in the mirror and find no enemy10","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"and it begins like this yo uh and it begins where we left a brother chased after by death until he catches his breath we embarked upon a long march too weary to

unemployed all null and void now i aint trying to be no sigmund freud but aint you supposed to have instincts when it comes to the boy i called a cab and took him to county hospital they shaved hair and burnt flesh off his skull held him overnight to fight infection i slept sitting up in a chair directly next to him i just knew you would join us but instead hopped your ass on the bus went home and went to bed thats the very moment i divorced you in my head god might forgive you for that i never did all you need right now faheem we can see the throne from here i may never sit there but brother youre the heir pull up a chair let pop bend your ear here baby dry those tears i know you wonder why your mother does the things that she do well its not because she doesnt love you its because she grew up in something they call foster care thats when strangers raise you your moms not there imagine how she felt when she was your age going from place to place never feeling safe never having love never having faith she probably thought the world was a big scary place where was her mommy at well thats kind of sad she used drugs to forget the problems she had there was a new one back then they called crack once you try it there was almost no coming back she couldnt be the mommy she wanted to be she was chasing a high all in the street wont tell you no lie real is all i can be i believe only truth can set you free theres a whole lot of pain in your bloodline but theres a whole lot of strength in the sunshine lean back let the new day greet you cause youre standing on the shoulders of a people who been beat down and treated unequal but the prayer that they made now has reached you its plain to see its true beautiful prince i wish they could see you all you need right
