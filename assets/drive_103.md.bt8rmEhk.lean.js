where i laid in the mist of foreclosure my people a cloud hovered and rained on my head non stop is how i suffered had two daughters biological was outstanding my stepdaughter she hated me misunderstandings the fire fanning should have been with her dad half a year later my marriage was really bad all i had was this music everything else im losing it hoping when these doors close shut some others open up its just the same old song without the singing so i pull my hood over my mind for stormy evenings until heaven stop the rain until heaven come up and stop the rain i asked god if he could take the rain away today but he aint answer so i said ok the function of the sky was grey and needed colouring other then a peep in the night so now my brother men keep twisting attitude shifting and bending hell i am pretending for levels lacking the sending of a challenge just to change your life stories to memories more knowledge to read at night become your history for years and years crystal ball is clear watching my life inside of it i have no fear to tell ya man its more to life than your idea wisdom man it grows like buildings holding careers we either talk to the next man or the reverend how we doing wrong not right starts at eleven talk to my daughter about life mainly the seven given birth on earth as it is in heaven until heaven stop the rain until heaven come

it s a labyrinth we go from one maze into another so many chambers and angles peelin the onion layers within it all i see the same gang just different players so i rebel from the prison cell of the pigeon hole and dare to be myself original a man lives on principles i don t posture to be popular born to be a leader not just a blind follower it s family before the dollar your priorities in order

wasn t taken in that instant but grew impressed with his persistence they met each other out by moonlight made love in the nearby woods then her folks became suspicious when her cycle broke it settled it they stole away without their goodbyes got married in a foreign town made their way as best as they could found jobs and settled down and then time moved on i was born in a river of blood on sheets from the wedding day the room was dark and the stench was thick my father couldn t stand the smell of it mama died in the night cause the nearest doctor couldn t stem the blood loss father cried out on the back porch my sister held me at the neighbor s house oh my there was a storm then there was a flood of a different kind father s eyes were often vacant but his hands were rarely quiet sister learned to take her hits well both from life and the physical kind but i was never one to lie down despite who picked the fight so we designed our hells father turned into a drinker a dark bastard with a wooden heart sister learned to be a mother before she ever played another part and i became a little terror i lashed out at whatever s around took some time before i settled to find a mind that was somewhat sound and as it always does time marched on six years later father died in the very same bedroom many said it was the grief that did it i d have to say it s cause he hung himself to be honest neither sister nor myself ever much regret his passing but i admit it was a nice thing to always know that we could feed ourselves","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"take your time walking home what

this far it s been a long time and i ve come so far try to stay in line while i m sippin the bar i can t help but sit down and ask myself why i try so hard when there s nothing left i used to say maybe tomorrow i could change but after five years only i m to blame it seems now that everything s the same and i ve been treatin life like it was a game but i know all i gotta do is try stop livin

used to go to the beach in the summer like a rock band we were complete with a drummer and we didn t care about nothing else but the girls in the sand well it didn t take long till i found someone at the time i thought was mine she was so much fun we hit it off great and we stayed out late but we knew that our time was about to erase i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name it s been so long still i wonder if she ever felt the same i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name it s been so long still i wonder if she ever felt the same and though i say that i never knew her name i knew what it was but i just never knew anything about her life and what she did back home things that i wanted to know but never did cause we both knew that are time was limited and it was all about living in the moment and making every minute count till our time ran out well i never thought i would let myself feel this way now about someone i didn t know never thought i would let my guard down this way now but i m starting to let it show and even though i know it s gonna end it s like i don t care if i don t win cause i can be sad when it s all over it s all over now i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name it s been so long still i wonder if she ever felt the same i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name it s been so long still i wonder if she ever felt the same  now this stranger put my emotions in danger cause i didn t really know what we was tight like wranglers we were sixteen doing the beach thing a quick fling strumming the six string the water glistening and listening to the waves for three days it was just a phase but amazed that i stayed half way sane in my mind it was a game as i reminisce man i think she felt the same i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name it s been so long still i wonder if she ever felt the same i d fallen in love with a stranger but i never knew her name

are hauntin me and tauntin me and wantin me to cut my wrists so they can watch me bleed and laugh at me as i scream in agony i get high for the sake of my family cause the alcohol is all that s helpin me to cope since i went broke and lost my hope i kicked my girl to the curb of the road you know i couldn t afford to support us both hell i m not rich don t have a good job do construction work with this dude named bob and he s an ass yells at me all the time pays minimum wage on overtime still he s got it made drives an escalade and gets two hundred times what i get paid but that s okay i ll drink to his health and ruin mine i ll chug liquor and he can sip red wine and i ll be fine trying to find some peace i ll quit payin my rent and i ll break my lease i ll live out on the streets and beg for change crawl in a box when it starts to rain forget my family and my friends forget the world y all i m drinkin again i m drinkin again tryin hard to hide the pain i m in so don t give me any shit i know just what i m gettin in sure it s a sin but i done lost control and i m drinkin again y all i m drinkin again i m drinkin again i done said goodbye to the twelve step program i m drinkin
