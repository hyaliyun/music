land of gangstas players replacements priests banjos we scramble to break mcs that may appreciate it guided by their envy insecurity and their hatred separated by the gimmie props technique and the desire to be the tops this week i gotta floss the speak cause talk is cheap even the broke kids can afford it that s why i stand close and if you re dope then i m supportive but if not we ll keep the mic warm for the next one respect the artform and make your wishes on the stars born within the movement fact checking trying to completely avoid all channels of backstepping from the lines of painted concrete that reside on lake street to the way we close our eyes to sleep and drift through deep space 9 type shit to find this i ve been around for as long as sound i ve been to that not so fresh phase and to that not quite that serious state but i ve evolved metamorphed manifestate i used to be young dumb and full of vision like it was religious rituals i made initial decisions i wanted to be a rapper world renowned from minneap to the bronx capture girls and crowns snap tackle and stomp that s when i found the abyss that sits in between the one that holds the mic and those that don t even listen formed some crews rocked talent shows at schools saturdays on the 18 making my way down to the record pool i met a grip of people that was bullshit was down with a lot of people that was bullshit but i ll pull shit from the asshole of an angel before i let him hassle and strangle the love triangle between me the mic and the turntable went to studios we want to make demos we want to do shows and rock our own instrumentals do our own production fucking around with this kid kazir nitwit engineer barely knew his own equipment atmosphere the prefix was urban wrecked shows made friends made foes overall we made flows and right now as i sit here right now writing this i m bugging off the people in my life that made me like this  within the movement fact checkin tryin to completely avoid all channels of backsteppin from the lines of painted concrete that reside on franklin ave to the dead bird on the elevator to that short in your crossfader i never got lost later for efforts to pester just throw your hands up in the air like a leper i ve been to that not so fresh phase and to that not quite that serious state metamorph and manifestate well sometimes it rings and i don t answer it that s it no asterisk no thirst to find the circumstances it was planted in me deep it was nurtured and it grew gave it sleep and nutrition it was efficient let it through there s a few that have developed to where i let them in my spectrum for the rest of em i give them just enough to cause infection not tripping on attention but if you have it it s welcome open arms potent charm i know the words and i can spell them seldom is it when one inquisits do they leave with disinterest in fact most begin crave the visits bringin me to the table that s it no more no less the love the life the stress slug the mic the mess testing yes i ve been tested and i ve tested some not saying i m the best believe i m not like the rest of em just saying i m better than you that s my mind state my rhymes take me into when i check one two i guess some do get pissed but intentions were to inspire build the empire before i get tired the ones that tear me down don t know it but they re the same ones that built me now quietly in your head say yes you can feel me asking himself even before the curtain goes up what am i i am now 80 years old and more and i am determined to find precisely what i am what i amount to they tell me i am everything they flatter me every day of my life i am now going to subject myself to a rigorous test in order to find out really what i am i don t care about kingdom i don t care about rule anymore it is of no importance to me as such but i must find out what i am before i die 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"cause i m high right now and i ain t comin down

own coach what kind of strategy advice is a bowling coach giving know what this time timmy i want you to knock down all the pins you sure trust me just do it son thats weird bowling seems silly but yeah we all take it very seriously right till we get that first gutter ball we re like lemme show you how it s done heh heh heh heh this is a stupid sport humph theres few moments in life as humiliating as that gutter ball the worst part is then you have to make that turn back to your friends that ball s broken it s tilted down there ya never wanna be the worst bowler in the group cause then everybody treats you like ya have cancer you can do it we re praying for you the advice starts use a heavier ball keep your arms straight you should get a bisect mate if you re really bad like me they ll ask if you want the bumpers up not like bowling s that complex anyway ya want the bumpers we can get rid of the pins why don t ya take this coloring book and sit in the corner but i like

now we used to laugh at grandpa like he was some old relic from the past because he never left the house unless he was wearing that funny looking worn out army hat every eye was on him anytime when he went anywhere they whispered and they pointed but you could tell my grandpa didn t care  i am not wearing this for them he d say it s a whole lot more than that for my buddies who gave everything the least that i can do is keep on wearing this old army hat he called me up one morning said he d seen it on the news on his tv they ve opened up a monument to world war ii in washington dc i am not getting any younger and i wish someone would take me to see that and i couldn t help but think they re going to laugh at you up there if you show up in that silly army hat two strangers both salute as grandpa walked up to the monument one said thank you soldier for the job well done the other said amen and a young boy told him sir my daddy went to war and didn t make it back could you take a picture standing here beside me and maybe let me wear your army hat every eye was on him there was not a dry one in the crowd they whispered and they pointed as my grandpa stood up extra tall and proud and he told him son just keep it when the young boy tried his best to give it back you re a brave little soldier and every soldier needs his very own authentic army hat for your daddy who gave everything the least that i can do is pass on this old worn out army hat","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"nineteen number on his back voted captain of his high school football team took us all the way to

to educate me on what exactly it is that they study there a person shouted we do whatever the hell we want i replied well that s what i ve been doing all my life i asked what their parents paid for them to do whatever the hell they want and a girl in the front row said 60 000 a year i said well that s what walmart pays me to use my music in commercials and that maybe i could go to their school one day too cause they all seem like really nice people i explained that kirk hammett from metallica went to college after metallica made it which was met with a thud a nice girl named sophie played piano on a few songs with us because my mic couldn t reach the piano she played the four notes on richard ramirez and carry me ohio really really well that was a lot of fun we also played when doves cry in honor of prince who died the night before steve shelley played drums with me that night by the way what a great drummer steve s also a really nice guy great acoustics in the room and the show went really well and we got out of there by midnight what a cool group of kids and a nice promoter named max it was the first show he ever promoted and he gave me a check in an envelope which i actually didn t open until just now here in my new york hotel three nights after the gig this is what his note said dear mark first of all thank you so much for playing sarah lawrence college even though we have a really small school and don t get much attention we have a really lot of passionate kids i know every single one of them is thrilled to have you come your music means so much to so many i first heard your music when i was searching songs about los angeles for a project in high school i was fifteen or sixteen and i came across cruiser and it changed everything for me it was the music i had been searching for for a long time some people say your music makes them sad and that you make sad music i don t know i guess i disagree your music was and is a comfort to me i feel a sort of connection to it that is less a melancholic thing but more a reassuring thing i was taking a seven hour train across the state of new york i listened to the entirety of benji and red house painters i back to back i thought of a lot of things when i listened to those records and somehow it brought me ease to know someone that was thinking some of those same things it was calming and even though i m writing this letter before you even take the stage i know the scene you perform tonight will be one of my most enjoyable moments so thank you again so much for coming i hope you had a nice time and i hope this letter finds you well looking forward to the next record the jesu sun kil moon lp was great and hopefully i can see you again on november 10th in brooklyn best wishes and thanks again max

random passage from the bible it s been in this house since the first day i owned it it was laying open swear i d never touch it but my housekeeper picked it up and closed it so here we go gonna read just a bit of it then look off into the pines and let my mind drift chapter 9 st luke christ sends forth his apostles feeds five thousand with five loaves is transfigured and casts out a devil then calling together the twelve apostles he gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick and he said to them take nothing for your journey neither staff nor scrip nor bread nor money neither have two coats and whatsoever house you shall enter into abide there and depart not from thence and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off even the dust of your feet for a testimony against them and going out they went about through the towns preaching the gospel and healing everywhere so there i was i read a part of the book of jesus now i m eating sunflower seeds and chili lemon peanuts sipped on a bottle of glacau smartwater and fell asleep until from upstairs my girl woke me up

when you said bye and closed my apartment door behind you a heavy feeling fell upon me it hit me in a very real way that we ll live the rest of our lives together and that gives me so much happiness and comfort but it also hit me harder than ever before that one day we ll say goodbye for a final time every day we get closer and closer to death i have no illusions of an afterlife and have no idea

and looked to be completely passed out she had a big map open on her lap but i knocked on the door and though she couldn t speak to me she was okay my biggest hope in life is that you are beside me

guy i saw on the plane yesterday he was following us to a hotel but i was diplomatic turned around and told him we d meet him on the balcony of some bar nearby when we arrived and talked to him he started throwing insults at me and i knocked his drink out of his hand and into the street he stayed there unfazed then i grabbed him by his neck lifting him pushing him almost but not quite over the balcony i told him to go fuck himself and to stay the fuck out of our lives he finally shut his stupid mouth and as we left caroline told me that i was good with dealing with creeps that was the end of the dream april 10 seat 2e united airlines las vegas to new orleans the fight didn t go as i thought to me the math added up to bradley winning by a decision if it went the distance but bradley was knocked down twice and lost bradley had a few moments and i jumped up out of my seat threw my fists in the air and got pumped up with excitement but manny was faster and countered him manny was the best fighter that night we were in seat 19b right where the fighters entered and exited i felt bad for bradley when he passed his trainer teddy atlas looked deflated yet stoic at the same time as he exited manny s mother and his wife and kids were all smiles when they exited i sat in my chair for a long time after the fight hemming and hawing about the defeat i owe money on my lost bet the fight hadn t gone as i predicted and that s life1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"chameleon chameleon what s on your mind i ve been sitting in my hot tub and i ve been watching for a long long time belly on

name was butch he was tough as nails you couldn t kill him if you tried he was tough as an ox but there on the floor he died next to a 40 and a hot plate next to the sound of a band rehearsing through the walls of a rehearsal space butch was always there and yet we took him for granted butch was a cool cat from another planet we though he d last like a piece of granite on your grandmother s kitchen cabinet we thought he d always be there like the stars and the moon but we re all gonna end up ashes in an urn or bones under a tomb he d watch over us down there in the tl he d watch us rock out to our music and was always supportive as hell he worked for fishbone and george clinton when he was younger to be around music butch had an insatiable hunger butch could show you respect and uplift your spirit butch could lay down the law and make you fear him butch could make you laugh and smile if you earned it butch had that sunny liston stare down if you deserved it  i remember thanksgiving out at my house just a few years ago with caroline and butch and nathan we watched drugstore cowboy and butch gave caroline tips on how to cook a turkey she thought butch was charming and sweet and he really took to her too matt dillon s character in drugstore cowboy was after dilaudid the holy grail of pharmaceuticals butch knew what dilaudid was he was older than me so there were things you didn t have to explain to butch there were things he just got and understood when someone is older than you always take the time to listen to them a person older than you knows something that you don t at the very least butch knew what it meant to be black and born in 1952 do you because i don t know shit about that i remember the wood burning stove and the heat was really cranking in the living room nathan kept getting up to remove himself from the heat and to have a smoke outside but butch didn t budge unless he needed to go to the bathroom butch wasn t the agile mother fucker he used to be and he needed a damn good reason to get up off of that cozy chair butch s favorite part of the turkey was the drumstick and when they left at around midnight or so butch took almost all the leftovers with him that was butch if he was in your backstage area forget it he had a relentless hunger and thirst and he cleaned your backstage area out butch makes sure no one stole no microphones butch makes sure that safely you return home butch makes sure no one stole your keys to your car or your wallet butch makes you clean your own fucking piss off the toilet there s no fucking around with butch he d shake you down he d put you in check until you felt like a fucking clown every day he d watch the pigeons flutter he saw the bums sleeping in the gutter and san franciscos tenderloin he walked the streets but i couldn t say if he felt joy and when my time comes for me to die i hope i see butch again and to pass some time i m sorry man i didn t get a chance to say goodbye but i hope you like my little butch lullaby i m sorry man that i didn t get a chance to say goodbye but i hope you like my little butch lullaby this one s for you this one s for you this one s for you this little lullaby butch was the resident mayor of the tenderloin butch was into red hot chili peppers funky monks video butch threatened a guy with a machete who was messing with equipto butch was there when i cut old ramon in the studio may 28th 12 58 am 2016 i m just back from butch s memorial i stopped and got a bouquet of poppies along the way it was a sparse attendance when i first showed up but it filled up pretty quickly i stayed out back for a while in the alley with a handful of people sharing stories about butch almost directly under the room where he died stories ranged from butch chasing people with sickles to his times with george clinton to his always entertaining mood swings people encountered over the years i asked a friend when it was exactly that butch began working at hyde street and he said that butch turned up with george clinton s entourage about 20 years ago or so that he just never left he said that there were several times he wanted to strangle butch but that he had an unexplainable affection for him that kept him around everyone had a lot of love for butch but seemed to have experienced some kind of confrontation with him except for me all of my experiences with him over the years were pleasant and i asked someone why that was somebody said because you re mark kozelek and i said no seriously really and they said well that s because you never told him what to do that was correct in all the years i ve known butch i have no memory of ever telling him what to do i mean i ve seen him get serious and angry before but it was always out of protectiveness and he was never hostile towards me at some point a couple asked me if i wanted to go smoke a joint with them with a group of people up in the echo chamber i said well i don t smoke pot but sure i d be happy to join them and that i hadn t been in the echo chamber for years the last time i was in the echo chamber it had been a storage room filled with amps and 10 inch tapes we went up there and a girl liked the way her singing voice sounded with all that echo she sounded like janis joplin and we all hummed along and tapped our feet as a joint that looked like a small wet cigar got passed around when we left the room several of the people began climbing the long ladder that leads to the roof they asked me to join but i said no fucking way i m too old it was late and i was ready to go home as i left a band was playing in the main room and lots of pizza boxes were everywhere and beers all around and girls were dancing butch would ve loved it i hugged a few familiar faces goodbye and headed out onto hyde street into the heart of the tenderloin like i ve done so many times over the years this time butch didn t follow me out like he would often do asking me to buy him a

floor and i checked into it it surprised me as i had heard the higher floors were for residents only as of may this year according to the guy at the desk anyhow it s actually the second and third floors so he told me i had read that richard ramirez stayed on the fourteenth floor and of course i asked about it but the clerk said nobody knew the specifics on the room in which stayed and i said ah shit fifteen was the very top floor right under the water tanks where a body was supposedly found i took the room and immediately walked around the hallways and noticed fire escapes all throughout building going from the bottom to the top had easy access to the roof the fire escape that was of course if a fire you aren t afraid the noise from the streets was so overbearing that i asked for a room on the other side of the hall they said they got a room on the fourteenth floor if i didn t mind and i said no not at all so i took it and i guess it was on what you call the courtyard side of the building but there was the loudest thud coming from somewhere keeping me up and after much exploring it was a elevator motor so all the other floors i went roaming i found the lower the floor the quieter the motor they gave me a room on the fourth floor but i didn t take the room without getting a photo of my fourteenth guest floor door and i finally fell asleep and when i woke up i went for a little walk that morning i m walking around la walking around downtown la and the sun is shining today for pushing 50 i m doing great i m walking around la walking around downtown la and the sun is shining today for pushing 50 i m feeling great saw richard edson parking his bike saw richard edson parking his bike i said i like your acting in spike lee s do the right thing i said i like your acting in spike lee s do the right thing and jarmusch s stranger than paradise and your liner notes on the sonic youth reissue then i said hey it was very nice to meet you an interesting thing to know in regards to the cecil there are two elevator doors in the lobby and two up above on the mezzanine level but in the famous footage that you see of the girl there s definitely an elevator door on the guest room hallway cause when you step out of the door to go to your room you see the white comms that were right in front of her and the wooden panel that goes sideways the amount of the activity in the lobby and the elevators in that hotel was more than any in all my years of world traveling the amount of staff members and maids and maintenance workers roaming around that place was totally mind boggling at all times young foreign tourists were lined up at the front desk as long as lines you d see at a busy big city post office would i say it d be easy to snatch up a girl and drag her up onto the roof in a 700 room place like that fuck yes would i say she could have been invited up there by a group of people to check out the view yes would i say she could have been pulled into one of the multiple shared bathrooms and choked out then dragged up and dumped into a shark tank fuck yes would i say that she could have easily went up there all on her own and went for a swim yes would i believe even more a kid pulled a prank and is sitting back on a love in the soap opera yes cause i see no evidence to support her death besides vague news reports and one photo of what were allegedly her parents showing up at the lax airport talk of losses but no legal documents have i ever seen to support it no lawyers speaking on behalf of the alleged lams and no friends who ever spoke on elisa s behalf i asked a parking lot attendant who had been working there for ten years when that girl was found dead up there in 2013 were you here she said ah i don t believe no girl up there ever even died i said me either but can i ask why you think that if you don t mind she said you know how a little thing is said and gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and i said yes and she said i think that s what happened next door i was completely with her caroline picked me up and i told her everything that happened she said cool glad you got that out of your system now let s go check into a real hotel down the street and get down to manhattan beach and say hi to cameron we re driving the 1 10 gonna say hi to a friend spend the day on his tv set and show some love and respect we re driving the 1 10 and we stop for italian food and saying hi to cameron thought that we re doing right and good we talked about bowie at length and he introduced me to luke wilson and he said he liked my bass playing in stillwater and i said i liked you in vacancy and bottle rocket and we talked about james caan and the godfather and cat stevens songs and steve miller he said man i hope we get to work together i said man that would be great it was nice to meet you we left the set and drove back downtown the biltmore as i feel asleep the mystery of elisa lam was still on my mind like what was i some fucking investigator and she was real and for whatever reason her body was found in that water i m sorry for the parents and their poor young daughter i m sorry for your loss this world can be a real pile of shit but i m counting my blessed tonight baby cause we re both healthy and alive so let s embrace it went

it are 49 and 53 maybe we watched a lot of welcome back kotter and maybe we watched a lot of sanford and son maybe we watched a lot of three s company or family ties or maybe a lot of brady bunch or whatever that one was with the re runs aw man who didn t want to get down with marsha brady suzanne somers or valerie bertinelli or farrah fawcett kate jackson or jaclyn smith nobody watched charlie s angels without having a favorite pick all i know is this reminds of the theme to barney miller it wasn t intentional just adding a song on the record for filler maybe this song will cause you to have a wet dream maybe this song will cause you to connect with an actual human being and maybe you ll hear this song when the sun is up maybe you ll hear it when you re down in the dumps maybe you ll hear it on a spotify stream your girlfriend ll say eww you actually like this shit break it off with you and leave or maybe you ve already turned this song off or maybe you re playing it and going check this out boss maybe you can t relate to this song maybe you re a millennial and you don t know the references at all maybe you ll hear it and say i prefer your older songs or maybe the world has changed and i m not that songwriter anymore sitting around moping about the hardships of being twenty four i ve heard old that stuff that s great and it s available at the amazon store if you like those steel string guitar sounds and those old slow beats that s cool but be careful when you re walking across the street with those headphones in those inner cities a car might hit you you might get mugged by a thief and you ll wish that you had a clue or you might fall asleep playing this album in the background thinking okay this is a pretty nice sound and then maybe by the time it s about two or three you ll find yourself deep asleep having a trippy dream just back from l a where i recorded vocals to the seventies track you can tell i spent a really long time on the right i spent months on those thank you anyhow it s a beautiful spring day in san francisco and just as i sat down to take a breath i heard something crash in my hall i walked over and part of the ceiling fell off and i was like jesus fucking christ can t i get a fucking break so i texted my building manager and she said a guy would be over to look at it he came over to check it out and all of things i ended up hiring him to redo my bathroom i ve been in the building for twenty two years and it s time for some new scenery in there i told him i wanted a white tile with gray veins my building manager warned me that he was colorblind so i pointed to a marble top stand that s gray and white he said that s brown i said no man that s gray you know like your hair man gray he laughed and said okay okay i said hey i got a little gray too i m not picking on you but please just tell the guy at home depot gray and let them pick the color fingers crossed that he gets it right it was a long weekend and i went to bed and i just woke up from a long sleep i dreamed i was invited to farrah fawcett s house it was a big beautiful house somewhere in california there were maybe ten people there none of whom i knew though farrah was older she looked just liked she did in charlie s angels and she was kind and a wonderful host her house was enormous with lots of glass and light and a nice open living room i took a walk outside and all the land around our house was rolling hills leading to the pacific ocean the land looked something like a cross between monterey carmel big sur and point reyes with beautiful orange flowers for days and days the ocean was off in the distance a bit but i walked down there and when i got the ocean it wasn t the ocean anymore but a river there were two couples fishing who didn t appear to know what they were doing one of the girls said she caught a fish but was struggling to reel it in i offered to help and she gave me the pull and warned me that the gear had been rented the line seemed like it was snagged on something as i was pulling i noticed a small boat floating towards us holy fuck her hook was caught on a small boat and i was reeling the boat in i didn t know why i didn t think to cut the line i guess it was sort of fun catching a boat and everyone was laughing when the boat finally got to the shore it crashed fairly hard onto a dock but not too hard of all things a few people were inside i entered the boat to discuss the damage with them they laughed and said not to worry about it that the fishing pole probably took more of a beating than the boat i thanked them and when i jumped off the boat the girl looked petrified i said aw god i m really sorry to tell you this but the boat owners want to sue they said there s quite a lot of damage in there many of their belongings as well as the motor and some damage to the back of the boat she began sobbing and i immediately hugged her and said nah nah i m just kidding it s okay there s no damage they re super nice people and they even offered to give you a new fishing pole if yours was damaged she said aw god she took a deep breath then she said let s just get the fuck out of here","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"love or loss cant tell anymore wind crept in to capture the beginning of a fever warning sign still dont give a hot shit about appearing in a childhood skit little
