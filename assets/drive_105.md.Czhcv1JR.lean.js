the fools that a young fool meets all in search of truth and bound for glory and listening to our own heart beats we stood around the drum though it s fainter now the older i become living your life day after day soon all your plans and changes either fail or fade away leaving so much still left to say but daddy i want to let you know somehow the things you said are so much clearer now and i would turn the pages back but time will not allow the way these days just rip along too fast to last too vast too strong somewhere something went wrong or maybe we forgot the song make room for my forty fives along beside your seventy eights nothing survives but the way we live our lives","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"sometimes i lie awake at night and wonder where my life will lead me waiting to pass under sleep s dark and silent gate i found my love too late running around day after day looking for the time to play while my old friends slipped away never should have had to try so hard to make a love work out i guess i don t know what love has got to do with happiness but the times when we were happy were the times we never tried looking down the road i don t know where i ve been don t know where i m going oh god this is some shape i m in when the only thing that makes me cry is the kindness in my baby s eye sometimes i lie awake at night and wonder where the years have gone they have all passed under sleep s dark and silent gate","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"in my early years i hid my tears and passed my days alone adrift on an ocean of loneliness my dreams like nets were thrown to catch the love that i d heard of in books and films and songs now there s a world of illusion and fantasy in the place where the real world belongs still i look for the beauty in songs to fill my head and lead me on though my dreams have come up torn and empty as many times as love has come and gone to those gentle ones my memory runs to the laughter we shared at the meals i filled their kitchens and living rooms with my schemes and my broken wheels it was never clear how far or near the gates to my citadel lay they were cutting from stone some dreams of their own but they listened to mine anyway i m not sure what i m trying to say it could be i ve lost my way though i keep a watch over the distance heaven s no closer than it was yesterday and the angels are older they know not to wait up for the sun they look over my shoulder at the maps and the drawings of the journey i ve begun now the distance leads me farther on though the reasons i once had are gone i keep thinking i ll find what i m looking for in the sand beneath the dawn  but the angels are older they can see that the sun s setting fast they look over my shoulder at the vision of paradise contained in the light of the past and they lay down behind me to sleep beside the road til the morning has come where they know they will find me with my maps and my faith in the distance moving farther on","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"everyone i ve ever known has wished me well anyway that s how it seems it s hard to tell maybe people only ask you how you re doing cause that s easier than letting on how little they could care but when you know that you ve got a real friend somewhere suddenly all the others are so much easier to bear now to see things clear it s hard enough i know while you re waiting for reality to show without dreaming of the perfect love and holding it so far above that if you stumbled onto someone real you d never know you could be with somebody who is lonely too he might be trying to get across to you when your own emptiness is all that s getting through there comes a point when you re not sure why you re still talking i passed that point long ago i m so tired of all this circling and all these glimpses of the end that s all the voices say you ll go right on circling until you ve found some kind of friend well i saw you through the laughter and the noise you were talking with the soldiers and the boys while they scuffled for your weary smiles i thought of all the empty miles and the years that i ve spent looking for your eyes and now i m sitting here wondering what to say afraid that all these words might scare you away no one ever talks about their feelings anyway without dressing them in dreams and laughter i guess it s just too painful otherwise look it s like you re standing in the window of a house nobody lives in and i m sitting in a car across the way it s an early model chevrolet it s a warm and windy day you go and pack your sorrow the trash man comes tomorrow leave it at the curb and we ll just roll away1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"when we come to the place where the road and the sky collide throw me over the edge and

wishing well and i can hear my dreams singing clear as a bell i used to know where they ended and the world began but now it s getting hard to tell i could be just around the corner from heaven or a mile from hell i m just rolling away from yesterday behind the wheel of a stolen chevrolet gonna get a little higher see if i can hot wire reality now can you see those dark clouds gathering up ahead they re gonna wash this planet clean like the bible said now you can hold on steady try to be ready but everybody s gonna get wet don t think it won t happen just because it hasn t happened yet i m

when you look at me and my brothers what s your first impression does the sight of us leave you guessin or do you understand the stressin the aggression the look of no hope on me and my niggas faces like the lord overlooked us when he handed down his graces you see embraces fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers still stuck in the walls of the project halls where the coke smell still lingers external blingers is all we can be cause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on and a record deal s harder to get than coke so my niggas get they grind on cause the tv tells us aim high nigga make all goals lateral but see that takes paper that we don t have so niggas put they souls up as collateral now some niggas reclaim em some blame em make an excuse to sell em but when a nigga goes from not doin to doin what can you tell him not to be a nigga shit i gots to be a nigga that s how i pay the bills and i mma do that whether i got to sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills see america makes you an opportunist and at the same time they institutionalize you so the fact that niggas get big record deals big money and go to jail shouldn t surprise you that s what lies do you see most of these guys do have raw talent just an infantile education so the business feed you all the weed and ecstasy and a little bit of paper to provide some pacification from all the bullshit frustration they serve you meanwhile they corrupt your perception of what the real is see they takin all our businessmen and givin em the mindsets of drug dealers took all our messengers made em rappers just flappin they jaws afraid to admit their treason took all our soldiers for the cause made em killers for no reason and bein fucked up well that s in this season so if you re negative you re positive and if you re positive you re called a hater but i maintain control of my soul cause i know it gets greater later and i told y all the last show shit a nigga no hater i just know what the truth is been intertwined in this puddin for bout a year now so i know where the proof is see it lines these midtown manhattan skyscrapers where former hustlers like myself sign papers and pull off fucked capers like 16 infamous stars of the time they got us choppin and baggin and servin that shit to niggas 16 bars at a time now the crime is undetectable by the feds cause in heads of our kids is where the track is and music is potent it s straight to the soul so it s much more addictive than crack is now the high is just an illusion all lies and confusion but to feel that rush just once my young bucks ll go through it so in essence they still floodin the streets with the thugs drugs and the killing they just usin these record labels to do it takin our hearts off demos puttin us in limos tryin to fuck up divine direction but young black men have been trained to chase money and pussy so we fall victim to our own erection and begin to convince ourselves we re on our way somewhere where we re not goin but ignorance is bliss and niggas love this so niggas take pride in not knowin we not growin nigga i give a fuck how slick you flowin if you ain t showin nuttin to these kids or addin nuttin positive to the earth black ice been destined to touch the world ever since i was born to be real fuck a record deal god gives me what i m worth soul survivor nigga

as a brown eyed flower child drinking straight whiskey there was liquid courage running through my veins and we went bar to bar running thought the raine the kind of love that drives a man insane an oasis of bliss in a sea of pain but theres a thing line between haste and action and now im crossing lines in search of satisfaction truth of the matter its as simple as this happiness can t exist
