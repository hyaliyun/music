catches fire down from our pride and up from the mire it s a dream that i ve had and i hope it comes true i forgot to say the revolution starts with you see wisdom and knowledge is one thing that we lack you ve been a christian how long and you re still on similac so i call on martin luther and all the reformation back then the common people couldn t read god s revelation you had to be a monk or a priest or read latin that was all before the revolution happened but the fire cooled down ever since that generation we put down the bible and pick up the playstation and we can t defend our faith

the upper town fez eldjid which lies on the edge of the plateau and hides from view old fez tumbling down below it into the ravine of the oued fez thus approached the city presents to view only a long line of ramparts and fortresses merging into the wide tawny plain and framed in barren mountains not a house is visible outside the walls except at a respectful distance the few unobtrusive buildings of the european colony and not a village breaks the desolation of the landscape as we drew nearer the walls towered close over us and skirting them we came to a bare space outside a great horseshoe gate and found ourselves suddenly in the foreground of a picture by carpaccio or bellini where else had one seen just those rows of white turbaned majestic figures squatting in the dust under lofty walls all the pale faces ringed in curling beards turned to the story teller in the centre of the group transform the story teller into a rapt young venetian and you have the audience and the foreground of carpaccio s preaching of st stephen even to the camels craning inquisitive necks above the turbans every step of the way in north africa corroborates the close observation of the early travellers whether painters or narrators and shows the unchanged character of the oriental life that the venetians pictured and leo africanus and windus and charles cochelet described there was time before sunset to go up to the hill from which the ruined tombs of the merinid sultans look down over the city they made glorious after the savage massacre of foreign residents in 1912 the french encircled the heights commanding fez with one of their admirably engineered military roads and in a few minutes our motor had climbed to the point from which the great dynasty of artist sultans dreamed of looking down forever on their capital nothing endures in islam except what human inertia has left standing and its own solidity has preserved from the elements or rather nothing remains intact and nothing wholly perishes but the architecture like all else lingers on half ruined and half unchanged the merinid tombs however are only hollow shells and broken walls grown part of the brown cliff they cling to no one thinks of them save as an added touch of picturesqueness where all is picturesque they survive as the best point from which to look down at fez there it lies outspread in golden light roofs terraces and towers sliding over the plain s edge in a rush dammed here and there by barriers of cypress and ilex but growing more precipitous as the ravine of the fez narrows downward with the fall of the river it is as though some powerful enchanter after decreeing that the city should be hurled into the depths had been moved by its beauty and with a wave of his wand held it suspended above destruction at first the eye takes in only this impression of a great city over a green abyss then the complex scene begins to define itself all around are the outer lines of ramparts walls beyond walls their crenellations climbing the heights their angle fortresses dominating the precipices almost on a level with us lies the upper city the aristocratic fez eldjid of painted palaces and gardens then as the houses close in and descend more abruptly terraces minarets domes and long reed thatched roofs of the bazaars all gather around the green tiled tomb of moulay idriss and the tower of the almohad mosque of el kairouiyin which adjoin each other in the depths of fez and form its central sanctuary from the merinid hill we had noticed a long faade among the cypresses and fruit trees of eldjid this was bou jeloud the old summer palace of the sultan s harem now the house of the resident general where lodgings had been prepared for us the road descended again crossing the oued fez by one of the fine old single arch bridges that mark the architectural link between morocco and spain we skirted high walls wayside pools and dripping mill wheels then one of the city gates engulfed us and we were in the waste spaces of intramural fez formerly the lines of defense of a rich and perpetually menaced city now chiefly used for refuse heaps open air fondaks and dreaming places for rows of lazaruses rolled in their cerements in the dust through another gate and more walls we came to an arch in the inner line of defense beyond that the motor paused before a green door where a cadi in a silken caftan received us across squares of orange trees divided by running water we were led to an arcaded apartment hung with moroccan embroideries and lined with wide divans the hall of reception of the resident general through its arches were other tiled distances fountains arcades beyond in greener depths the bright blossoms of a flower garden such was our first sight of bou jeloud once the summer palace of the wives of moulay hafid upstairs from a room walled and ceiled with cedar and decorated with the bold rose pink embroideries of sal and the intricate old needlework of fez i looked out over the upper city toward the mauve and tawny mountains just below the window the flat roofs of a group of little houses descended like the steps of an irregular staircase between them rose a few cypresses and a green minaret out of the court of one house an ancient fig tree thrust its twisted arms the sun had set and one after another bright figures appeared on the roofs the children came first hung with silver amulets and amber beads and pursued by negresses in striped turbans who bustled up with rugs and matting then the mothers followed more indolently released from their ashy mufflings and showing under their light veils long earrings from the mellah and caftans of pale green or peach color the houses were humble ones such as grow up in the cracks of a wealthy quarter and their inhabitants doubtless small folk but in the enchanted african twilight the terraces blossomed like gardens and when the moon rose and the muezzin called from the minaret the domestic squabbles and the shrill cries from roof to roof became part of a story in bagdad overheard a thousand years ago by that arch detective haroun al raschid","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"too

mild in north carolina but the year i was in the fifth grade we got lucky snow fell and for the first time in years it accumulated school was cancelled and two days later we got lucky again there were eight inches on the ground and rather than melting it froze on the fifth day of our vacation my mother had a little breakdown our presence had disrupted the secret life she led while we were at school and when she could no longer take it she threw us out it wasnt a gentle request but something closer to an eviction get the hell out of my house she said we reminded her that it was our house too and she opened the front door and shoved us into the carport and stay out she shouted my sisters and i went down the hill and sledded with other children from the neighborhood a few hours later we returned home surprised to find that the door was locked oh come on we said i rang the bell and when no one answered we went to the window and saw our mother in the kitchen watching television normally she waited until five oclock to have a drink but for the past few days shed been making an exception drinking didnt count if you followed a glass of wine with a cup of coffee and so she had a goblet and a mug positioned before her on the countertop hey we yelled open the door its us we knocked on the pane and without looking in our direction she refilled her goblet and left the room that bitch my sister lisa said we pounded again and again and when our mother failed to answer we went around back and threw snowballs at her bedroom window you are going to be in so much trouble when dad gets home we shouted and in response my mother pulled the drapes dusk approached and as it grew colder it occurred to us that we could possibly die it happened surely selfish mothers wanted the house to themselves and their children were discovered years later frozen like mastodons in blocks of ice my sister gretchen suggested that we call our father but none of us knew his number and he probably wouldnt have done anything anyway hed gone to work specifically to escape our mother and between the weather and her mood it could be hours or even days before he returned home one of us should get hit by a car i said that would teach the both of them i pictured gretchen her life hanging by a thread as my parents paced the halls of rex hospital wishing they had been more attentive it was really the perfect solution with her out of the way the rest of us would be more valuable and have a bit more room to spread out gretchen go lie in the street make amy do it she said amy in turn pushed it off on tiffany who was the youngest and had no concept of death its like sleeping we told her only you get a canopy bed poor tiffany shed do just about anything in return for a little affection all you had to do was call her tiff and whatever you wanted was yours her allowance her dinner the contents of her easter basket her eagerness to please was absolute and naked when we asked her to lie in the middle of the street her only question was where we chose a quiet dip between two hills a spot where drivers were almost required to skid out of control she took her place this six year old in a butter colored coat and we gathered on the curb to watch the first car to come along belonged to a neighbor a fellow yankee who had outfitted his tires with chains and stopped a few feet from our sisters body is that a person he asked well sort of lisa said she explained that wed been locked out of our house and while the man appeared to accept it as a reasonable explanation im pretty sure he was the one who told on us another car passed and then we saw our mother this puffy figure awkwardly negotiating the crest of the hill she did not own a pair of pants and her legs were buried to the calf in snow we wanted to send her home to kick her out of nature just as she had kicked us out of the house but it was hard to stay angry at someone that pitiful looking are you wearing your loafers lisa asked and in response our mother raised a bare foot i was wearing loafers she said i mean really it was there a second ago this was how things went one moment she was locking us out of our own house and the next we were rooting around in the snow looking for her left shoe oh forget about it she said itll turn up in a few days gretchen fitted her cap over my mothers foot lisa secured it with her scarf and surrounding her tightly on all sides we made our way home","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"well we found a life together and it s a gonna last forever nothing can hurt me now cause you are
