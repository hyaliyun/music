companion tyrion we are travelling together in each others company therefore jorah do you ever shut up tyrion i sailed from kings landing to pentos in a crate without ever saying a word jorah sits down next to tyrion jorah why tyrion never occurred to you to ask why until now you never wondered why tyrion lannister decided to visit a brothel in volantis jorah im sure youve visited many brothels in many cities tyrion i killed my father he wanted to execute me for a crime i didnt commit and he was fucking the woman i loved jorah gets up tyrion as miserable as you are mormont at least your father was a good man jorah what do you know about my father tyrion i met him i visited the wall when i asked him about his men he knew all the stories every one of them he actually cared about the people in his command how did they put it in the watch we shall never see his like again jorah looks stunned tyrion you didnt know im sorry i am jorah how tyrion i only know what i heard jorah how

all this as i recall the mormonts fought against the targaryens during roberts rebellion jorah do you believe in anything tyrion i believe in many things jorah in something greater than ourselves i mean the gods destiny do you believe there s a plan for this world tyrion no jorah neither did i i was a cynic just like you then i saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs when the fire burned out i thought id find her blackened bones instead i found her daenerys alive and unhurt holding her baby dragons have you ever heard baby dragons singing tyrion no jorah it s hard to be a cynic after that tyrion doesnt mean shes going to be a great queen jorah no it doesnt tyrion the targaryens are famously insane what if she conquers the world then what 1 000 years of peace and prosperity jorah first we have to conquer the world tyrion we alright lets assume your dreams come true shes ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf she hacks off my head and restores your position you command her army sail to westeros defeat all your enemies then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the iron throne hurrah long live the queen then what jorah then she rules tyrion so a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in westeros becomes the ruler of westeros thats justice jorah she is the rightful heir tyrion why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king jorah sees a ship anchored in the middle of the sea and pushes tyrion behind a rock jorah shh its a slave ship tyrion why is it anchored jorah they probably came ashore for malko water malko and his men all carrying swords surround tyrion and jorah smiling same place later tyrion and jorahs hands are tied malko punches jorah in the face he gets up malko got a lot of fight in you huh malko punches jorah again slaver salt mines malko that or a galley slave he looks strong enough slaver what about the dwarf malko worthless cut his throat the slavers man approaches

wait wait wait wait you cant just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it he has to know it came from a dwarf and how could he know unless he sees the dwarf slaver it will be a dwarf sized cock tyrion guess again tyrion looks to malko malko the dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant the slavers get jorah and tyrion to their feet jorah queen daenerys has outlawed slavery malko were bound to volantis not slavers bay besides she reopened the fighting pits i never heard of free men fighting in the pits tyrion the fighting puts in mereen youre in luck then youre about to be rich you are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms malko looks at tyrion and laughs tyrion him malko him hes got to be 60 years old tyrion sure hes a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long we can all see that but he is a veteran of 100 battles they wrote songs about him malko gestures to his men to bring jorah closer malko is that true jorah nods tyrion he won the tournament at lannisport unseating ser jaime lannister himself malko shakes his head and laughs tyrion the kingslayer malko jousting youre talking about jousting a fancy game for fancy lads the men who fight at mereen will swallow him whole jorah i killed a dothraki blood rider in single combat malko jumps up shocked and gets in jorahs face malko liar jorah its no lie his name

woman a kind woman cersei she was neither of those things we both know it still i pity her son how fortunate that the young lord of the vale has a new father to counsel him baelish i know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age cersei if war comes to westeros will the knights of the veil fight for their king baelish young lord robyn heeds my advice and i have always counseled loyalty to the throne cersei good if theres nothing else baelish there is another matter your grace something so urgent i couldnt trust the words to a raven you once charged me with finding

plans to marry her to his son ramsay a bastard recently legitimized by king tommen cersei roose bolton is warden of the north by the grace of my father baelish indeed as reward for stabbing his own king in the heart cersei we were fools to trust a turncloak baelish marrying his son to the last of the starks gives him more legitimacy in the north than an alliance with a hated southern house cersei i will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil baelish i would counsel patience your grace cersei patience sansa helped murder my son roose bolton is a traitor baelish

olenna oh you can smell the shit from 5 miles away well why are we stopped go on ext kings landing garden olenna rumors and gossip thats all they got its theater nothing more if they arrested all the pillow biters in kings landing thered be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else margaery everyone knew about him and renly olenna renly baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the seven kingdoms everyone knew no one cared margaery but he was the kings brother olenna and loras is the queens brother no no no no this is unacceptable margaery cersei is behind this olenna of course she is she wants to drag our names through the dirt put us in our place get some rest dear you look appalling let me deal with cersei lannister int cerseis room cersei writes at her desk without acknowledging olenna olenna your grace i have travelled a long way cersei you must be exhausted olenna put the pen down dear we all know you arent writing anything cersei ah yes the famously tart tongued queen of thorns olenna and the famous tart queen cersei cersei beg your pardon olenna i know youre behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson cersei if you apologize for that comment perhaps olenna youll get your apology when i get loras cersei i was as shocked as anyone when the faith arrested ser loras i have no love for these fanatics but what can the queen mother do olenna has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies cersei i assure you our alliance with house tyrell remains olenna do you expect the alliance to continue after youve thrown our future into prison cersei as i said i didnt imprison anyone as for your veiled threats olenna what veil cersei the lannister tyrell alliance brought peace to a war torn country do you really want to see the seven kingdoms slide back into warfare olenna i didnt trust your father i didnt particularly like him but i respected him he was no fool he understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them cersei house lannister has no rival the high septon has called for an inquest not a trial just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against loras have merit which im sure they dont loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and well forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened good day lady olenna int high septons room high sparrow you are aware of the rumors concerning you and renly loras i dont pay attention to rumors sparrow you were said to be despondent when he died witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside even as stannis army closed in loras he was my friend he was my king sparrow wasnt joffrey your king he was anointed by the 7 not renly loras i was wrong to support renlys claim i know that but i was forgiven by joffrey i fought for him at the battle of the blackwater sparrow wearing renlys armor loras why does it matter what i wore sparrow do you deny all of the charges against you fornication buggery blasphemy loras of course i deny them sparrow you never lay with renly baratheon loras never sparrow nor any other man loras never sparrow that will be all ser loras loras walks back to his seat olenna well i think thats quite enough of that sparrow faith calls queen margaery forward margaery you call me forward sparrow yes we have some questions for you margaery i am the queen sparrow you are and according to law of the seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest margaery walks to the stand sparrow how do you respond to these charges against your brother margaery they are lies sparrow all of them margaery all of them sparrow queen margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge margaery yes i swear it sparrow thank you your grace the faith brings olyvar in loras looks shocked cersei gives a thin smile sparrow do you know this man olyvar yes very well he is ser loras tyrell heir to highgarden sparrow how did you come to meet olyvar i squired for him he took a liking to me he summoned me to his chamber the first day we met sparrow and what occurred in his chamber olyvar we engaged in intimate relations sparrow you laid with him olyvar that night and many others loras liar hes a liar sparrow is there anyone else who can support your claim olyvar yes yes queen margaery she walked in on us once not long ago she didnt seem surprised cersei this testimony is an insult to a great house why should the faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to highgarden olyvar he has a birthmark your grace quite high on his thigh wine colored and roughly the shape of dorne loras jumps at olyvar and the faith restrains him margaery and olenna get up to leave and the faith blocks their way loras liar olenna what are you doing let us pass sparrow the faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for ser loras and queen margaery margaery what sparrow bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any take her the faith grabs her and carries her out of the room margaery tommen tommen king tommen looks around the room unsure of what to do margaery you cant do this i am the queen tommen tommen i am your queen how dare you olenna glares at cersei cersei smiles

the safest streets but you can find your way home if you have imagined your way back then my dear you re more than halfway there and you might only possess what you ve carried on your back but you ve always been free now it s time to believe time to give up that unforgiving act of altogetherness and start living out your oldest childhood dreams well losing your mind it ain t half as bad as it seems and if you would take the risk well it might be worth your time it s only your life it s only going by  goodbye sweet mother earth without you now i m a lonely universe you won t always

of our seats but not off the plane you never think about it but airplane doors are twenty feet in the air and even if you survived the jump they probably would have shot you you can go up to first class you can stretch in the aisles there are three seats on each side and there was only one aisle in the middle everyone knew every inch of that plane  our flight was full there were children sleeping on the floor we had no way to get information this is before most people had mobile phones and only a couple people got through hello mom bonjour operator tom oh thank god i finally got through i borrowed a passenger s phone how are you are the kids okay no i m fine tom i m fine safe and sound on the ground here in newfoundland we don t know much except for the bbc listen i can t

that we flew together tell them i m fine put a pin here in gander on our plane someone has a cell phone but then the battery dies there are phones in the backs of the seats but they don t work half

complimentary booze open the airplane doors wave at all the cars hello to whoever you are wherever we are the ground crews supplied whatever we needed nicotine patches medication pampers something to drink so the flight attendants brought out all the mini bottles of liquor and delivered them to everyone soon everyone got friendlier i took a couple of pictures of the view there with my camera we didn t know where we were but we knew that we were hammered open the airplane doors wave at all the locals surely there s something better to do than park wherever we are we d been sitting there for fourteen hours when we pull out the grey goose kevin and i were kind of hiding it because because we didn t want to share it anyway this woman this hot mess behind us kept completely freaking out i

re one of those people who laughs when english people say awkward things i just wish we knew what was happening what s happening what s happening somewhere in between your life and your work when the world may be falling apart and you think i m alone i m alone and i m so damn helpless there s nothing left to do but drink we open the airplane doors flash all the cars whoo i ve never done that before twenty eight hours god over an entire day running out of things to say and wondering if there s someone going to clue us in tell us all what s happening because the sun is setting and we re sitting in the dark wherever we are later that night i m up in the cockpit with some of the other passengers when the pilot puts the radio on over the intercom and the whole plane goes silent when the president gives his speech i ask the american people to join me in saying thanks for all the folks who ve been fighting hard to rescue our fellow citizens and to join me in saying a prayer for the

like youre tied to a slave masters cruel hand and it s the same pain that drives that oppressors heart of stone so youve grown to love the man you keep pouring yourself out again and again into legible lines through a crooked pen yeah its painful but its familiar so habit breeds comfort and i dont know what id do without him so in the early morning when youve fallen asleep in our home i drift back into the memories that ive claimed as my own and wonder if tonight will be a night ill hang on my wall like i did before we stopped taking photos out of the habit of being comfortable with not trying at all in a perfect world well have albums labeled seasons with chapter headings and well staple them to the cork board that hangs at the foot of the bed theres longevity in a memory spilt out in pen and if a picture is worth a thousand words then ive written down every one of them i work hard scarred toil through that soil for the youth i see in my friends but these journals are moments in time snapshots of our lives and in retrospect age is an overexposed photo that the memories can t mend i know my sweet seductress and her name is depression i wrote best beneath that demons destructive oppression in those polaroids she drove the ink into the canvas like a slave beneath his masters cruel hand and i hated that whip but always wondered what id do without it so i grew to love the man oh i wept for change i begged for movement and the good lord he answered my prayers but you dont know how to breathe easy when you let go of your habits even if your comforts left you gasping for air dear time grandfather s as creaky as his front porch scent like oil in the gun barrel dip can kicked over the railing sandpaper hands stuck behind thumb tacks on my wall ive got an ache in my chest for every season i miss and it gets worse when the snow starts to fall there are butterflies alive in that couples eyes a few years since forgotten by all and sometimes if the phone starts to ring i can still hear their wings when you call but i begged for movement and i got what i asked for and i can picture the answer like it came yesterday and in the land of the gods i think that things are timeless but we are still prone to decay you know i still lift up hope of certain smiles in those photos for us when i pray time is a cruel lover and she breaks her house apart at its

packed in stitch packed in a propaganda to sell my friends on the statement that life holds meaning and i can write about the life i m living but most often it feels like i m just writing not living

professional at letting go accepting that only black and white in life is now grapevines wrapping around my mind and numbing me into falling in love a sacred bond now a cultural joke still trying to live but functioning enough to keep pushing i wish i could finally inhale and exhale freely but sometimes i need to choke i need to be reminded that this is not another formulated system i ve come upon in order to feel accepted or maybe it is because i ve become pretty good at keeping my demons at bay and i always tell myself i got them to go away but every time i move on to a new point in my life i want them to stay and everyday i ll invite them into my home stupidly just so i don t feel so alone cause now i m drowning hoping somebody comes by or sees me as something worth saving and the interesting thing about falling in love is that sometimes moving on keeps me from moving forward i found out i m not so grave and i wanted to say this to your face but my pride scared me away so just

in the day i will no one s gonna fuckin tell me jack but can you rely on anyone in this world no you can t it s all my fault there s wall to wall empty cans i sat in the kitchen all fucked off imagining over and over what they were all doing behind my back dodgy things going on actions i regretted stain bottle with a pipe and tin foil on the mat scott texted me to say he d have a look at the tv for me and i felt like just telling him to fuck right off chap but what he said about wanting to do the right thing by both mates and then opting to stay out it seemed to match but i told him he could make it up by fixing the tv he said that s the least he could do to square things flat i thought that d be that but then the next bit was mad this is where everything started to all turn back it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was he had to unscrew about fifteen screws before he could pull the panel off the back to get in the fecking thing but just as he did so he said he saw summat that slipped inside behind the panel down the back of it must have been some leaflets or a bill maybe i didn t wanna lose the bill in case it was a final warning so we both tried to get the back off and work out if there were any more screws to get out or if we left any in and when he looked down the back of the tv his eyes just froze before he rammed his hand in saying no shit he s looking at me absolutely speechless he can t quite believe what he s trying to pull out the slit i get up wondering what he s smiling about he s shaking his head at this point with the biggest of grins i look down the back of the tv and that s where it was in all its glory my thousand quid it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was about two this afternoon the last of the people left my house cause they never stop chatting til all the racket s gone i really feel like things clicked into place at some point or maybe it s the fact that me and alison really got on or maybe it s that i realised that it is true no one s really there fighting for you in the last garrison no one except yourself that is no one except you you are the one who s got your back til the last deed s done scott can t have my back til the absolute end cause he s got to look out for what over his horizon he s gotta make sure he s not lonely not broke it s enough to worry about keeping his own head above i shut the door behind me huddled up in my coat condensation floating off my breath squinted out the sun my jeans felt a bit tight i think i washed them too high i was gonna be late so i picked up my pace to run it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was it s the end of something i did not want to end beginning of hard times to come but
