eclipsing eclipsed is it completely void or is the truth in shade are all the facts before us a masquerade suffering no deceit no selfish lies we stand in our own crypt and we mobilize waking up to blazing heat and the stench of rancid meat dont have the patience or the time to repeat mistakes like high hot hauls through highway tolls with bigger brothers for hungry trolls each horn sharpened by eye sockets torn standing on the graves of the worn welcome to the place integrity is born heart in the right place just missing the mark feigning exception is a shot in the dark with no remorse and no regret is anybody listening yet tremble beneath the weight of inevitability and all the casualties therein cower in the shadow of the ever present sun witness eclipsing eclipsing eclipsed bask in

believe theres anything beneath i dont believe theres death in the basement no i dont believe no i dont believe embrace the fall there is no end no ambiguous hypothesis to comprehend no bruised and

message therein profound in our final moments our true names are all discovered so let it fall fall even if it turns out to be futile at least we couldnt ask for a sky so clear or a day more beautiful

grass and printed the mud with the well hammered shoe that she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth and although he goes grazing a minute away she tracks him all night she tracks him all day and she s blind to his presence except to compare her injury here with his punishment there then at home on a branch on a high stream a songbird sings out so suddenly and the sun is warm and the soft winds ride on a willow tree by the riverside ah the world is sweet and the world is wide and he s there where the light and the darkness divide and the steam s coming off him he s huge and he s shy and he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky and he comes to her hand but he s not really tame he longs to be lost she longs for the same and he ll bolt and he ll plunge through the first open pass to roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass or he ll make a break for the high plateau where there s nothing above and nothing below it s time for their burden the whip and the spur will she ride with him or will he ride with her so she binds herself to her galloping steed and he binds himself to the woman in need and there is no space just left and right and there is no time but there is day and night then she leans on his neck and whispers low whither thou goest i will go and they turn as one and they head for the plain no need for the whip oh no need for the rein now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight who snaps it asunder the very next night some say it s him some say it s her some say love s like smoke beyond all repair so my darling my darling just let it go by

for don t you know that it s coming don t you know that it s coming i go so deep in my mind i don t know when i ll surface take a breath head first into something uncertain searching for gold threw this away like i knew this was old the temperature perfect the verses are cold imagine that came back with something that s brand new if you don t stand up how they gonna understand you cause they all brainwashed this music the shampoo head and shoulders above em i can t lose man to be the one chosen is something you can t choose you gotta play the hand that you re dealt you gotta start counting your blessings instead of your wealth and if you try to make a change you better start with yourself and stop running stop running i know you wanna get away i know you wanna get away tell me what are

wrong steady lying bout id rather be alone shit and if i did i d have to own up little did i know the cognac was keeping me from growing up and my fear of flying keeping me from blowing up and musical meditation is spiritually glowin up this is my work but it was just a diversion when i was kicking the curb feels like i m sinning when i be seeing the light cause now i m working on this living just to rap about life that s some backwards commitment and on the way i know i gave away some friends and every day i wish that we could speak again but every time i wanna make it right i freeze up and the visions of the shadows of my demons who went out of sight they ve been out of sight until now sometimes when you aim to build you end up destroying things the kind you hate so much you end up enjoying things like how we break it up to keep it moving forward but when we sit inside the new box we thinkin about the older things i m just a man playing god with my thoughts over pans and pots these scotch rocks are acting like novocaine might as well fix the grill spill the spray until the day that my brains cold that s what i told the rain pre apocalyptic l a everyday yet i keep myself company on the motorway like the hunchback of notre dame ringing dead radio waves still feel this weight from the barricade tryna feel like a human among these animals tryna feel some community in this solitude and as i hit the nuke button once again i can see that i don t have a single friend  until now they went out of sight until now they went out of
