everything or maybe words are just my only thing 2006 dilla died and i was living off his gift i just heard donuts at the borders on the corner in la habra i was over all these people tryna tell me my aspirations were goners i wrote my poems so i could stay in my zone thinking why go to church if i feel god in my home maybe i write because i m feeling odd in my bones and when i exorcise this demon i m not thinking of those it s 2010 i got some shows and i m finally making friends i m on the cusp of something big and i can feel it everything has been building up to this momenti can steal it i m just a aphid in the crib speaking major lip service paid for showed the whole city what this wayniac is great for word to the kev machine word to everything these words are everything or maybe words are just my only thing  2016 i spent the last 2 years fucking up big dreams you never know what you want until you get it the future ain t set sometimes it s the little things winning over these checks i had the chance to sell out and i told them bout how words are everything much bigger than gold clouds if i m a shell of a man my words are empty ringing through the halls of my bones for near a century don t lecture me i see that selling soul get better things and maybe its just fear that s keeping me from better scenes but i m here one piece an uncle and a beast when they hit play they know that imma feast so rest in peace married to the game but it s complicated i know just how it works if i was smart i d get hella cake like if i throw a hook upon this beat it d get hella plays if i just said yes to all these fools i d get hella paid if only i could keep my mouth shut no enemies but i don t see the point in knowing truth and not set it free i can t both express myself then play the game if you just can t handle what i say then don t say my name keep it out your mouth like a foot rappers babble like a young adult book look my trifocal looks could kill some dumb occult crooks burn a skull cook if i come out retirement i got em all shook let me shake em then paperless stirring up emotions with my paper pen if you getting this for free what you pay for then word to friends

seen thee rising high o er book and paper i bend thou didst appear o mournful friend i am the spirit that ever denies and justly so for all that is born deserves to be destroyed in scorn therefore twere best if nothing were created destruction sin wickedness plainly stated all of which you as evil have classified that is my element there i abide scatter the stars with a lavish hand water fire tavern wall birds and beasts all within command thus in our narrow booth today creation s ample scope display wander swiftly observing well from the heavens to the world to hell the world of spirits is not barred to thee now then faustus what wouldst thou have mephisto do i charge thee mephisto wait upon me while i live to do whatever faustus shall command be it to make the moon drop from outer sphere or the ocean to overwhelm the world go bear these tidings to great lucifer say he surrenders up his soul so that he shall spare him four and twenty years letting him live in all voluptiousness having thee ever to attend on me to give me whatsoever i shall ask i will sublime spirit thou hast given me all all for which i besought thee not in vain didst thou reveal thy countenance in the fire thou hast given me nature for a kingdom with the power to enjoy and feel only a visit of chilling bewilderment thou bringest all the living creatures and taught me to know my brothers in the air in the deep waters and in the silent coverts when through the forest the storm rages uprooting the giant pines which in their fall crushing drag down neighboring boughs and trunks whose hollow thunder shake the hills then thou dost lead me to a sheltering cave and revealest me to myself and layest bare the deep mysterious miracle of my nature and when the pure moon rises into sight soothingly above me then about me hover creeping from rocky walls and dewy thickets silver shadows phantoms of a bygone world which allay the austere joy of meditation now fully do i realize that man can never possess perfection with this ecstasy which brings me near and nearer to the gods my mother the harlot put me to death my father the scoundrel ate my flesh my dear little sister laid all my bones in a dark shaded place under the stones then i changed into a wood bird fluttering away fly away mankind that foolish cosmos always acts as incomplete he thought himself to be i am part of that part which was the absolute a part of that darkness which gave birth to light the arrogant light which would dispute ancient rank of mother night therefore i hope it won t be long before with matter it shall perish evermore scatter the stars with a lavish hand water fire tavern wall birds and beasts all within command thus in our narrow booth today creation s ample scope display wander swiftly observing well from the heavens to the world the world of spirits is not barred to thee so still i seek the force the reason governing life s flow and not just its external show the governing force the reason some things cannot be known they are beyond your reach even when shown why should that be so they lie outside the boundaries that words can address and man can only grasp those thoughts which language can express what do you mean that words are greater yet than man indeed they are then what of longing or affection pain and grief i can t describe these yet i know they are in my breast what are they without substance as mist is in that case man is only air as well 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the honor roll was all i d known till you took me over to the dark side the thrill was good together
