you had nowhere to go chorus narrator well he rested easy at the bar his foot upon the rail and laughed and talked of times he d had out living on the trail the silence was never broken as the words poured from his lips quiet as the forty five he carried on his hip he said cowboy i rode the cattle drive from here to san antone ten days in the saddle you know and weary to the bone i rode from here to wichita without a womans smile the camp fire where i cooked my beans was the only light for miles chorus narrator well he rolled another ciggarette as he turned toward the door i heard his spurs a jingling as his boot heels hit the floor he loosened up his belt a notch pulled his hat down on his head as he turned to say goodby to me this is what he said cowboy now the high lines chase the

in a house with his mother his room was piled high with crates of vinyl records the boy liked to sit on the floor with his turntable his records stacked around him and strewn about at night he could pull his blanket up under his chin and look around his moonlit room one day there began a great period of rain when walking with his mother the boy saw a rainbow in the sky he asked her what it was his mother began it s what happens when the sun shines through the rain but she soon paused she looked down at her boy and up again at the rainbow and thought of a different story she said the rainbow is a path it leads from dark to light and from light to dark it leads to your imagination if you open your mind you ll find your dusty rainbow from the dark the rainbow is a path it leads from dark to

betrayed tryin not to look ashamed well the drunkards drink deeply from cups full of nothingness ghost lovers laugh at the games that they play while the moments do somersaults into eternity cling to their coattails and beg them to stay saying i got nothing to hide well illusions projected on walls made of tiffany mad minuets to a sad satin song harlequin mandolins harmonize helplessly hoping that endlessly won t last for long praying that their god ain t dying then i turn and i see her in a dress made of moonlight teardrops like diamonds run slow down her face and her arms they surround me like chains made of velvet and the demons fall faithfully into their place and the river runs with jewels now the morning lies open the night went quite quickly memory harmlessly fractures and fades

of cold when do you say you took your dream too far and finally come to grips with the person you are i think for some of us the dream s too vivid and the gift we ve been given is the curse that comes with it if you strive for perfection and progress you beat your own ass in the process man i m satisfied never my shit always could be better shit the verse i m saying now could be way more clever i remember when there wasn t no pressure i just do this before the music was part of a to do list i love writing but why i m clueless it s peaceful yet deceitful like a buddhist judas and its s fucking up my brain but somehow it s the only thing that keeps me sane i guess i m like a little goth art student take away his pen next day at school he starts shooting but arts stupid if you consider the bitter cost of this all the relationships i ve lost to this all the times that i hit ignore when my family and friends they would call for this a constant state of exhaustiveness i give my all to this a stressful endeavor like tiger woods probably thinks that golfing is i should get a office gig but i can t cause i m over here dreaming and as i write another song i just feel like screaming stop fucking with me stop judging me i just want to live comfortably and i ain t talking about wealth i m talking about my brain i m talking about mental health stop fucking with me stop judging me i look around and suddenly i realize that there s nobody else the only one judging me is myself most people they got big dreams and big plans end up as a big flock of sacrificial lambs a single achiever can make a billion believers look at the children they re all willing and eager like when i was a kid i watched jordan play and dreamed of being up on the nba court one day realized early that i didn t have it that don t mean that there ain t people that took that stab at it like my man every day practice shooting baskets dreaming about playing for the magic or mavericks high school star a 30 point a night average 4 year college starter alright average didn t get drafted still he could see the dream now he s 35 playing for some european team knees fucked up constantly throbbing now he s popping oxycontin and it s becoming a problem had to move back with his mom and she want him to get a job but he doesn t have any qualities they need can t put 3 man weave drills under specialty skills more and more he eats pills prescription refills he still sees that dream that vision and it haunts him a voice inside his head and it taunts him his mom thinking that he s on something and she right as he screams in the middle of the night  stop fucking with me stop judging me i just want to live comfortably and i ain t talking about wealth i m talking about my brain i m talking about mental health stop fucking with me stop judging me i look around and suddenly i realize that there s nobody else the only one judging me is myself i wake up in the morning it s the same old thing i wake up in the morning it s the same old thing we can t all be heroes shit it s hard enough not to crack under the pressure of average expectations most of my heroes were drug addicts so dream high and be prepared to fall really fucking far take a walk around the city tour l a listen to what addicted women on the corner say study their words many of them weren t born this way many moved here back in the day thinking that they d be the next dorris day there was role she was born to play but somewhere she went astray some people crack on the day that disappointment comes when they realize they ain t one of the annointed ones she saw the vision and she came here on a mission audition after audition but she never caught a glimpse of success and then she got older and the industry disowned told herself that it was over now she never ever sober and it drove her to the point she can t control her own emotions or addictions but she still sees the vision when she s dreaming a voice in her head like a demon and she on sunset at the bus stop screaming stop fucking with me stop judging me i just want to live comfortably and i ain t talking about wealth i m talking about my brain i m talking about mental health stop fucking with me stop judging me i look around and suddenly i realize that there s nobody else the only one judging me is myself but stop fucking with

young you ve no rights you long for new heights but some of those nights leave more than love bites tops cropped skirts stop at the top of their thighs and the boys got that hungry look in their eyes they wanna be grown up and have respect you see but they re acting uneducated sexually i ain t saying be celibate go out and have your fun but there s plenty you can do without impregnation and there

rolling around the streets rowing and fighting but it s all just because life ain t too exciting and it s easier than trying to do the right thing but there are other choices if you want them you don t have to tow the line and just float with the flotsam you can build your time better when you find a passion the internet and public services give free education so it really ain t a case of rich or
