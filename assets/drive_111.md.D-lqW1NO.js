lovers the tie dyes the tired eyes and the rest so im going out to see what the water makes of me or if there is just a lubber in my chest its not about cattle im sick of committing so i might as well straddle the line between starting and quitting and if they dont commend me they wont get off easy cause its hard for me i guess so the salt negates my bitterness this silly situation is hit or miss my love for you is nearly gone between a thorn in my side and a water bitten ride i will take the one with more wide open sky and if they publish me ever and i get what is coming about my endeavor and not about the fact that im running a magazine cover so your future lover will shiver when he reads whats become of me its been a matter of months i dont matter to you so i guess there is something that youd like me to do find something abandoned or a deeper shade of blue or maroon or a darker night sky but its gotten to the point where i think i can see in the murkiest depths for several miles it seems but no publications have even mentioned my name so i started wearing earth tones again i started feeling alone again ive started wondering where you are but its not like ive seen all the things i need to see and its not like ive done all the things i gotta but i miss you goddamnit i hate to admit it i didnt even plan it but my head went and did it so ill stay a bit longer and ill hope to get stronger but im weaker than you think but if i cant stop this restlessness then i cant stop the rest of this ill take my longing to the shore and im going back westward so i can counter sequester myself from yourself and yourself from the storm the streets are more quiet than they were when i left them i wont start a riot but i guess ive got a couple of questions like where the hell are you and what am i to do now that ive returned and my bridges have been burned but as my luck would have it you quit your bad habit you started sleeping with the door closed and the curtains drawn tight and an absence of light and the feeling something bad is gonna happen so my shoulders pulled through just in time to find four hands in the air but none of them were mine so im going back out

and poor and horribly hairy the outside was rough but once he smiled you could see that he had a heart of gold inside the beast loved a beauty this pretty little thing she was the fairest of them all and she could dance and sing but unlike the beast whose love shined the best she loved herself never cared for the rest la belle et la bte quelle tragdie elle est comme le jour il est comme la nuit il est amoureux elle ne se soucie pas vont ils mourir tout seule on verra one day the beast found the beauty perfection sitting by the lake the beast then decided that it was the time to tell the pretty beauty of his feelings inside he stepped out from the shades with a flower in hand said bravely my lady the fairest in this land i might not be a prince but my heart beats for you oh the beauty just laughed so cold so cruel you smelly old fat hairy pig she said you thought i could love you i d rather be dead still laughing she turned and danced to her home leaving the beast heart broken alone la belle et la bte while the beauty lives all by herself still today the beast learned his lesson and changed his ways he found that true beauty cannot be seen and that things are most likely not what they seem","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"hey hey my my rock and roll can never die there s more to the picture than meets the eye hey hey my my out of the blue and into the black you pay for this but
