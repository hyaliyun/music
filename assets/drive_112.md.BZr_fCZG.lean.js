come on now nod your head im gonna do it a check in yo we all know that life can get hectic but if you live in the second you exist in the present and that s how you stay connected through good times and hardships if you learn to just accept it and know that every struggle in life is there to teach you a lesson it s times like this that make you it s always the darkest part of the night right before the sun has its breakthrough the spirit s there to knock you down but if you make that the end you ll never know the beauty of being able to stand up again and face it with patience the basis is dealing with judgements and hatred depressed hopeless feelings but i ve been told that you only create your own ceiling and life is limitless and knowing this is what the spirit is that s why i try

behind it that s the way it was supposed to be at anytime you could turn over a new leaf we all know the truth it s up to us to use the key it s been three years since my first album dropped and it s been fear that s really got me stuck in this spot not wanting to put out anything whack so instead of putting my licks on tracks i put my lips to a sack cause it s easier to spend your life drunk and high on drugs than to put everything in a recording put it out and then get judged we look for the audience to put their hands up and show love but when their hands go down our confidence really takes the plunge so instead of making music that people might not like i went into isolation and traded in my mic for the pipe started living the college life drinking and smoking every day rationalizing to myself that i was going through a phase that i d stop thinking my music would take its place but when you live in fog inspiration s hard to create it takes more to get connected than to quit smoking for a day and when i get frustrated i get a swisher and get blown away then all of a sudden it hit me these kids are listening if i m not making music then why the fuck am i existing how can i talk about the problems of something else when i don t have the motivation and confidence to change myself it s been so long since i really truly felt what it s like to live life without substances to help massive struggle that s natural to one s health but with addiction in my blood i play the cards i was dealt knowing that it s the most calm right before the storm and when you least expect it it doesn t rain it pours i swear to god you can never be warned and with or without umbrella nature s still gonna take its course  that s why i try and inhale deep so i can find peace in essence just find me

across the ocean to the shore till he can shout no more i have come o er moor and mountain like the hawk upon the wing i was once a shining knight who was the guardian of a king i have searched the whole world over looking for a place to sleep i have seen the strong survive and i have seen the lean grown weak  see the children of the earth who wake to find the table bare see the gentry in the country riding off to take the air reaching for his saddlebag he takes a rusty sword into his hand then striking up a knightly pose he shouts across the ocean to the shore till he can shout no more see the jailor with his key who locks away all trace of sin see the judge upon the bench who tries the case as best he can see the wise and wicked ones who feed upon life s sacred fire see the soldier with his gun who must be dead to be admired see the man who tips the needle see the man who buys and sells see the man who puts the collar on the ones who dare not tell see the drunkard in the tavern stemming gold to make ends meet see the youth in ghetto black condemned to life upon the street reaching for his saddlebag he takes a tarnished cross into his hand standing like a preacher now he shouts across the ocean to the shore then in a blaze of tangled hooves he gallops off across the dusty plain in vain to search again where no one will hear through the woodland through the valley comes a horseman wild and free tilting at the windmills passing who can the brave young horseman be he is wild but he is mellow he is strong but he is weak he is cruel but he is gentle he is wise but he is meek","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i used to be a fisherman on the icy crests we d ride like a banshee on the wind we d sail the ocean wide from the shoals of yarmouth bay to newfoundland we d

from a crooked cottage on the hill i can see tomorrow s rain rumble through destiny down a sleepy hollow lane if we re all merely players in a play on this great stage the problem is the script writers ain t on the same page i echo through the mountain when i m singing in the air from my lab a lad with lavish living in his lair i just write in my haven set the challenge so to speak recite it to my raven like edgar allen poe try i ve been serving gems with a thin swerving pen transcribe the world i see through a tim burton lens to the grim certain end these rebels stay proud hear the levels way loud at the devil s playground from my tower at sunset i watch all the misled slow motion human lemmings running to the cliff s edge with this said let s get free from their grasp cuz there s no path to peace ya ll peace is the path so i chill under the arctic with my mellow cup of tea and broadcast transmissions from my yellow submarine i ve been trekking this trail since the earth was born i sail my black pearl through this world s perfect storm it s like see every night through my eyes is a window i watch life pass by like the wind blows and when i turn from my mirror that s my intro to step into this life with my mic and some inspo ration please forgive me for my sins though when i m alone in the dark left in limbo i light a thought like a spark to my indo forever put it down for my art and my kinfolk daddy who lives down the end of destiny lane son two poets sit above the clouds down in destiny lane i m a field full of flowers i ma bring it back by dinner i m the skill i m the power i m a silverback gorilla you still a caterpillar thinking your killer raps are iller so while you beef i m fishing writing chilling by the river so let me introduce you to my castle of calligraphy the lights are on we re all at home we march to a new symphony that mad hatter of that motion music whose liquid lyricism leaves the oceans moonlit so my pirate ship can set sail through the sun rain snow or hail cuz there s something bout to happen like there s something in the wind on a quest without a vest like i m huckleberry finn so call me that book with a spectacular twist cuz even hogwarts ain t seen magic like this see i m that author in the attic that ll liberate the mind with a bird s eye view trying to illustrate time i was born ready  see every night through my eyes is a window i watch life pass by like the wind blows and when i turn from my mirror that s my intro to step into this life with my mic and some inspo ration please forgive me for my sins though when i m alone in the dark left in limbo i light a thought like a spark to my indo forever put it down for my art and my kinfolk the next scripture will be read by none other than the big macca licious i have served a 7 foot thousand wave to be here this evening to greet you with the thoughts of a cosmic cowboy who will travel the land to spank the monkey in front of the queen s face while watching television in the debate to tell you that that is brain washing bullshit back at it it s big macca 1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there ll be no lettin there ll be no lettin up now tell me

smoke and mirrors lead me astray see the pit boss steal each tick tock time it seems will suffer at our hands i look for exits in the haze the dense electric twilit maze i ve heard that there is one that leads to sunlit lands where daylight breaks on you and shines into the gray that sleeps beneath your skull daylight breaks on you and burns away the gray that suffocates your soul daylight daylight daylight daylight  daylight they tell me that it s just a myth and they try to betray me with a kiss and daylight they tell me that it can t exist and they might never know just what they ve missed as daylight pours fire into my gray eyes pours grace into my gray life breaks in and lights the way i can t live without the day","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"verse a sinful audience in sight
