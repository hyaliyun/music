that i been through like fightin and shootouts and bangin and shit all because a nigga made a hit check it 1991 it was double or nothing not a nigga wit hit then we broke out with the fonky shit about bitches and niggas and gettin drunk and off that bud i was doing the shit they hadn t heard of but foolish was i to think that it wasn t no other cities like this and they didn t like this that compton was the home of a foot in yo ass where you got blast and now that s just a thing of the past let me tell ya why firsthand we did a show up in oak land and niggas was kickin up sand to them

just letting you know that if ya plan to take a trip to the bay keep your hand on your clip because oakland yeah i m telling y all oakland moving on to st louis where they country as fuck with gold teeth in they mouth but they still know what s up where it s hot as a muthafucka hot enough to make ya cuss that s why i kept my ass on the bus but later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends who put us up on the st louis cap the smith center with big bob little steve tojo biss and rich and a couple of bitches then they took us to a man named gus in a store he put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore that s when i started thinking that this wasn t like home but then they had to prove me wrong cause later that night after we did the show we went back to the afterset and wouldn t ya know yeah bloods and crips start scrappin and shootin in missouri damn how could this happen now st louis yeah y all st louis i don t think they know they too crazy for their own good they need to stop watchin that colors and boyz n the hood too busy claimin sixties tryin to be raw and never ever seen the shaw but now back to the story that i m tellin we packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin when we arrived i saw red and blue sweatsuits when i m thinkin bout horse dookie and cowboy boots i guess texas ain t no different from the rest and san antonio was just waitin to put us to the test and before it was over the shit got deep a nigga got shot in the face and was dead in the street then they came in the club thinkin of scrappin little did they know that we was packin yeah we was puttin em down and scaring the rest shit i even had to wear the bulletproof vest now san antonio yeah san antonio after about a month on the road we came home and i can safely say that l a is a much better place to stay how could a bunch of niggas in a town like this have such a big influence on niggas so far away but still my story ain t over cause i got one more to tell and the people of colorado they know it well it was all in the news and if you don t remember i had this show i did in denver with a punk ass promoter in a bunk ass skating rink bitches was lovin it but niggas was shovin and shit to the front of the stage to throw their gang signs but i m getting paid so i didn t pay it no mind then i poured out my brew onto their face and chest then

that fall in love with a material item we re gonna pump the beat a little something like this i m in junior high with a b plus grade at the end of the day i don t hit the arcade i walk from school to my mom s apartment i got to tell the suckas everyday don t start it cause where i m at if you re soft you re lost to stay on course means to roll with force a boy named rob is chillin in a benz in front of my building with the rest of his friends i give him a pound oh i mean i shake his hand he s the neighborhood drug dealer my man i go upstair and hug my mother kiss my sister and punch my brother i sit down on my bed to watch some tv machine gun fire do my ears deceive me nope that s the fourth time this week another fast brother shot dead in the street the very next day while i m off to class my moms goes to work cold bustin her ass my sister s cute but she got no gear i got three pairs of pants and with my brother i share see there in school see i m made a fool with one and a half pair of pants you ain t cool but there s no dollars for nothing else i got beans rice and bread on my shelf everyday i see my mother strugglin now it s time i ve got to do something i look for work i get dissed like a jerk i do odd jobs and come home like a slob so here comes rob his gold is shimmery he gives me two hundred for a quick delivery i do it once i do it twice now there s steak with the beans and rice my mother s nervous but she knows the deal my sister s gear now has sex appeal my brother s my partner and we re gettin paper three months later we run our own caper my family s happy everything is new now tell me what the fuck am i supposed to do that s why you fall in love with your chain you fall in love with your car love is gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind so i want you to check the story out as we go down the line money s flowin everythin is fine got myself an uzi and my brother a nine business is boomin everything is cool i pull about a g a week fuck school a year goes by and i begin to grow not in height but juice and cash flow i kick up my feet and begin to watch tv cause now i got other people workin for me i got a 55 inch television you know and every once in awhile i hear just say no or the other commercial i love is when they say this is your brain on drugs i pick up my remote control and just turn cause with that bullshit i m not concerned see me and my brother jump in the bm drivin around our territory again i stop at the light like a superstar and automatic weapons cold sprayed my car i hit the accelerator scared as shit and drove one block to find my brother was hit he wasn t dead but the blood was pourin and all i could think about was war and later i found that it was rob and his crew now tell me what the fuck am i supposed to do  you know that s why that word love is very very serious very addictive my brothers out of it but i m still in it on top of that i m in it to win it i can t believe that rob would diss me that faggot that punk he s soft a sissy i m drivin around now with three of my guys the war is on and i m on the rise we rolled right up to his favorite hang out said hello and then the bullets rang out some fired back so we took cover and all i could think about was my brother rob jumped up and began to run bustin shots hopin to hit someone so i just stopped and let off three shots two hit him and one hit a cop i threw the gun down and began to shout come on i got him it s time to break out but as we ran there were the boys in blue pointin their guns at my four man crew they shot down one they shot down two now tell me what the fuck am i supposed to do thats why you know a lot of people believe that that word love is real soft but when you use it in your vocabulary like you re addicted to it it sneaks right up and takes you right out so for future reference remember it s alright to like or want a material item but when you fall in love with it and you start schemin and carrying on for it just remember it s gonna get you 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i ain t going back to jail next time that the county or the state see me it s gon be in a bag uh this is it baby end

and spray a little on the curb remember what you own take the sunset home if no one s out right now i hope you know you re not alone try to find some nights to watch the shining lights park see the city sparkle out on diamond heights all those attractive glass spires that we love to stack higher i m starting grass fires when my car backfires after four flat tires rolling off road to avoid the bad drivers coming back home and i climb the walls into the sky on tall risers to make it all brighter so blaze your lighters up raise your cider cup and let s pull an all nighter when the sun sets on

tips and we never really kept them loaded just in case cause each enemy was a friend and none of it was about oil religion or land it was all just pretend remember how we used to bend reality like we were circus strong men like our imaginations were in shape then like we were all ninjas trained in the deadly art of did not like i totally got you did not remember how we forgot remember how our parents told us never to look directly into the sun and how we were their sun and so we never looked directly into the mirror in fear that we would go blind remember how we used to find any old reason just to call someone we were crushing on like we could just pawn off our sense of embarrassment buy a chunk of courage that would last just long enough to have us askin em about math and stuff and how stuff was just stuff like i heard you re getting braces now braces somehow were and still are kinda hot remember how we forgot remember how we all caught mono and our folks would go oh the kissing disease and our first steps into gangstahood had us saying mother please even though wed never really kissed anyone even though we never did half the things we said wed done we just spun yarn like rumpelstiltskin spun gold we told ghost stories never realizing we would one day ourselves become ghosts haunting the hallways of schools breaking all the rules of silence in the library but we had no chains to rattle no voice to battle the fact that we had no vocal chords we had only finger nails on chalk boards we would scream shout and yell trying to tell ourselves what experience can teach is what no teacher taught remember how we forgot once upon a time we were young our dreams hung like apples waiting to be picked and peeled and hope was something needing to be reeled in so we can fill the always empty big fish bin with the one that got away and proudly say that this time impossible is not an option because success is so akin to effort and opportunity they could be related so we took chances we figure skated on thin ice believed that each slice of live was served with something sweet on the side and failure was never nearly as important as the fact that we tried that in the war against frailty and limitation we supplied the determination it takes to make ideas and goals the parents of possibility and we believe ourselves to be members of this family not just one branch on one tree but a forest whose roots make up a dynasty so when i call you sis or bro its not lightly and when i ask you to remember its because the future isn t what it used to be so remember now pay tribute to every sacrifice laid upon the altar of somehow for all the times somehow we overcame somehow we pushed on somehow weve gone the distance and in going there we possessed the freedom to map the uncharted lands of any and everywhere we are unbound six feet above the underground where we will all one day rest so until then test the limits test the boundaries and borders as if the headquarters of potential lay just beyond the world s edge let the belief that hope belongs to us all be the pledge you take to make the unachievable as inconceivable as the false fact hat we were never here we were here and our memories are as dear to us as every slow motion moment or held breath so remember every instance before death every first kiss first dance near miss last chance yes no maybe so let us go the distance once more let us remember all the moments that were and were not like the point is something we can get and what we can get is what we got because all we have are the times between the moments we connect each dot so live and remember burn like an ember capable of starting fires like each moment inspires the next like memories are the context we put ourselves in so that life becomes the next of kin we need to notify in case of a big bang or extinction level event let now be our advent let us live like we meant it let us burn like we mean it because this world doesn t give a shit if we end in a train wreck or a car crash if our story ends with a dot or dash if we were dust or ash because all we were is all well be and all we are is the in between of so far so good so forget every would could or should not forget remembering how we forgot live like a plot twist exists now and in memory because we burn bright our light leaves scars on the sun let no one say we will be undone by time s passing the memories we are amassing will stand as testament that somehow we bent minds around the concept that we see others within ourselves that self knowledge can t be found on bookshelves so who we are has no bearing on how we appear look directly into every mirror realize our reflection is the first sentence to a story and our story starts we were here","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"shooting off vicious collections of words the losers make fact by the things they have heard and i find myself trying hard to defend them i made decisions some right

think up just aren t as scary as letting yourself be talked into believing you can be only half of what you are she d put a hand on each scar and say if you really want to get scared watch the news its steeplechase every day thousands of people face going under thousands of knives but it s still more cost effective for doctors to pay off lawsuits than its to save lives so don t try walking a mile in my shoes just wear my pajamas and walk in my dreams instead beause this isn t a deathbed she d say i m not gonna give up today i m not just gonna lay here and take it beause life is as elusive as getting an orgasm from my ex so sometimes i just got to fake it so if anyone ever tells you you re not good enough you re not smart enough give up your foolish dream if anyone ever tell you to quit you got to make them wear a diaper on their mouth because man they re just talking shit then she d smile and say you gotta let your body be the rocking chair that soothes the tired body of hope let your arms be the rope around the neck of self loathing let your skin be the clothing that keeps compassion warm on the cold streets of regret she says don t pray for me yet and i said no problem religion is something i gave up on along with dieting but love love is a feeling that in me and through me i ve often called god so i will love you she looked me straight in the heart and said its a shame they don t make hospital beds for two but kid you got your own shit to do and i can t continue to let you be doing alright or be going just fine not when there s world full of people tired of dressing in shadows just waiting for you to shine now bring me my goddamn jello she liked jello she liked me too during visiting hours i had to read to people who had no one but this is about a woman named everyone this isn t about death it s about the fact that i can still feel her breath in my ear sometimes i can even hear her say you re not giving up today because i live in a world full of seeing eye underdogs and i m pretty sure we re all tired of wearing our choke chains we re tired of being treated like walking canes in a world so blind no one can find each other so we just keep bumping into one another like people are just buildings made of bone who collapsed every time they re made to believe they were meant to stand alone but you re not some of us can love some of us look

menu but everything s on it impossible i know but i met a man who makes meals at a restaurant called death row i met a man who makes the last meals and i know way too many people who would attack him asking him how it feels to be part of something like that so instead i just let him chew the fat and i listen and he tells me about a 31 year old boy a 31 year old boy because he was convicted at the age of 22 been waiting 9 years on death row and last week was his turn so he asked for sourdough french toast and a side of magic beans because he d rather face down a giant rather take his chances with a beanstalk than walk down that hall where every footfall echoes into that same oblivion where every experience he never had congregates to create a world he never lived in so yeah you find yourself asking for things like magic beans and a cook finds himself understanding what it means to be desperate take my clothing i dont want it all my money never had none save your pity for the needy never had it dont need it now im gone and he tells me that most of this food never gets touched that doesn t stop him from being exact even though the fact is he ll never make a meal as good as mom could it ll never taste as good as it would coming from the one who raised you and he knows this but he s meticulous even though he knows that this 31 year old boy grabbed his arresting officer s service revolver tried to use it like a problem solver he knows this but he makes french toast with sourdough as though he was cooking for a king because the last thing you should do is eat well especially if there s a family praying that you have to go slow when you take that walk through hell so everything s fresh and the eggs are free range and there s a last minute change of pans because the last hands to wash that pan missed a spot and this cook got a vision of french toast that falls apart so softly it feels like lovers lying in bed breaking apart to sleep so deeply the shallow of their dreams is enough for hate to drown in because if you re goanna come up short on a request like magic beans you better be sure the first part of that meal means something he tells me it s a job and as clich as it sounds someones gotta do it tells me back in the day they used to let mothers try but most of them couldn t get through it so a job was born out of necessity and those struck by poverty didn t have false visions of turning this work into their legacy they didn t dream of a dynasty were the mountains were made of chocolate or sugar stood in for sand but they knew america would put a check in their hands so men and women were born into workers because ideas like right and wrong get outweighed by need anytime you ve got mouths to feed he tells me that america failed that they nailed freedom to a cross because every boss in every office in his own separate world having to be held up by the backs of employees expected to say please every time they have to take a piss i know way too many people who would tell me that they can t go on like this and we say this but we still set our alarms to be up in time for our 9 to 5 we re just reporters coming to you live from bus stops and coffee shops we wear our lives like costumes use bills and coins like props in an over budget production that we cannot seem to stop so it just goes on like this as if we accept this as if we ve all become buddhas of mass production our brains rotting like teeth under the sweet unending bliss of false enlightenment and he tells me we used to be flint and we d spark whenever struck by new ideas but now all there is is jobs and someone s gotta do them and isn t he lucky that he lives in a country where everyone wants to be someone naked deep down where you burymy bones dont want no company i spend my lifetime in solitary dont scare me to be alone and isn t he lucky that when the day s done he can go home and forget like he played this hand knowing it was a bad bet because what you risk reveals what you value and this man ventured everything he knew to the point where his wife can no longer convince him that her eyes are the colour blue and what kind of life have you got left when you want no one to know what you do see he lets everyone think that hes just a cook because he doesn t want his kids to know what daddy does and is unable to tell his mother where he was when they executed a 31 year old boy killing the first son of the same mother he made the meal the man who took his brother because he didn t trust anyone who was willing to fill in for him that day because they d say things like dont worry with just enough of a smile if he ever stood trial trying to defend that meal all he d ever feel is guilty so he made french toast with sourdough as though he was making a monument to his virtues that would never be brought down by the half truths of america in truth it never got touched and he tells me when the skeletons in his closet finally bust down the door all he s gonna need is his fist and someone s jaw says regret is like living your life as a blind man having to imagine everything you lived but never saw he can t imagine it any different than his mother at the execution sitting in the front row clear tears mixing with blush and eye shadow sitting there looking as though shed been punched in the face by a rainbow but he says i know i did the right thing and i m not here to sing his praise or raise a big deal made of granite and concrete but america will never fall to its feet and say i m sorry and all this is is the story of a man who makes meals and how one day he made a testament to his ethics golden brown and stacked a perfect 5 inches high tells me he feels bad for the boys on death row he knows america failed them he says most of them still ask for apple pie","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"home late from work and i m feeling so wiped out there s never a minute of rest you ve had the kids and you re feeling the same way there

lurking at the train station mad brothers know his name so he thinks he got a little fame from the stick up game and while we re blaming society he s at a party with his man they got their eye on the gold chain that the next man s wearing it looks big but they ain t staring just thinking of a way and when to get the brother they ll be long gone before the kid recovers and back around the way he ll have the chain on his neck claiming respect just to get a rep ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped the one with the hoodie said we ll hurt you if you don t run all your jewels and pay give up the rolex watch or you won t see another day see they were on the attack and one said yo you wanna make this to a homicide rap make it fast so we can be on our way kick in the rings and everything ok the kid was nervous and flinching and little shorty with the 38 yo he was inching closer and closer put the gun to his head shorty was down to catch a body instead money was scared so he panicked took off his link and his rings and ran frantic but shorty said nah pulled the trigger and stepped it was nothing he did it just to get a rep the rep grows bigger now he s known for his trigger finger rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure he s near the peak of his crazy career his posse s a nightmare macking jewels and crazy gear but as we know the things we do come back and shorty s not peeping others are scheming to counteract cause the kid that got shot didn t perish so he pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows too late shorty was caught in the midst his time ran out his number came up and that s it you know the rest so don t front the plan has been upset some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep7","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"aiiyo son it seems like everyday more

ruled the world was king on the throne i d make peace in every culture build the homeless a home i m not running for congress or the president i m just here to tell the world how my story went you see first it was a dream i was living in rome and then i moved to london bought a brand new home and everywhere i went i drew lots of attention like a stretch limousine one of those new inventions it took a few years fore the day had come but i was ruler of the world ranked 1 so i headed towards washington to claim the crown let the whole world know that the king was in town as i arrived the crowd started to cheer and then someone yelled out the king is here so i headed toward stage to make a speech about the new style of living i was gonna teach uh huh if i ruled the world i d love all the girls wear diamonds and pearls if i ruled the world people started flowing as they reached for my hand i said thank you for bringing me to the promised land but now i must go so goodbye to everybody tonight i ll see you all at my super dinner party and late that night at my super dinner party i was dancing to the beat and entertaining la di da di the music started ending it was time for a speech the crowd started sitting as i rose from my feet and this was once a dream i explained to the crowd but now i rule the world and i feel so very proud excuse me please for stopping this show i just had to thank you all huh and me so my first day in office the king on the throne i spent my first three hours on the telephone you know with newsmen reporters and voters too i had so many calls i didn t know what to do you know hours passed i continued to work i signed so many papers my fingers started to hurt then i shook off the pain say this ain t no thing cause there s nothing in the world like being 1 king  if i ruled the world i d love all the girls wear diamonds and pearls if i ruled the world now i rule the world and now i m on top and i m rolling with folks that could never be stopped and i m here to let you know this is where i belong and to you sucker mc s that sing my song and it s a song that s strong about right and wrong and i ma rock it to you baby baby all night long and it s a song about love and happiness in a world of peace and you know that s fresh now i m the king and i want you to know that i m the master blaster rapper who s running the show and to all of you rappers in every country you better stop what you re doing and listen to me cause we gotta stop war and use unity to fight crime and hunger and poverty cause the african baby is dying overseas while you sucker mission politicians busting out z s huh 20 million people all unemployed while the rich man try to play pretty boy floyd while the working class just struggles hard try to make ends meet against all odds while the poor man can t even deal with life you know he tried to escape and smoked the coke on the pipe and it s time for a change to a better way cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day so listen up world while i teach this class and take heed to the message or we ain t gonna last cause i know the solution is the contribution of woman and man to just join the revolution that ll take your brain to a higher plane and help you deal in a world that s gone insane with the problems that i know we can stop from the ruler of the world and the man on top but the years went by and time was up and then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck and all the people at the time who said they were my friends didn t know me when my job had come to an end the king who took my place was happy as can be he was running his mouth like muhammad ali so i shook his hand calmly as i headed to the door on my way to the ghetto to treat once more if i ruled the world i d

sometimes it made me frightened mad i wish i ve been raised without them like some other children had but now i m grown with kids of my own and i know just how they felt and though it seems to me that

like they about to be extinct never met his girlfriends little sister but she recognized him from cell phone pictures any other circumstances she d have hollered but topless in heels is a little bit awkward eventually his friends leave and when he gets up she grabs him by the coat sleeve too drunk to catch what she says but he did offer her three hundred on some head like  when you do wrong it makes me want to do right it also cancels out the guilt that makes the load feel light it also gives some leverage to the morally impaired so make mistakes for us to hold over your

irresistible appeal of black individuality where has all of that gone the very people who blazed our path to self expression and pioneered a resolutely distinct and individual voice have too often succumbed to mind numbing sameness and been seduced by simply repeating what we hear what somebody else said or thought and not digging deep to learn what we think or what we feel or what we believe now it is true that the genius of african culture is surely its repetition but the key to such repetition was that new elements were added each go round every round goes higher and higher something fresh popped off the page or jumped from a rhythm that had been recycled through the imagination of a writer or a musician each new installation bore the imprint of our unquenchable thirst to say something of our own in our own way in our own voice as best we could the trends of the times be damned thank god we ve still got musicians and thinkers whose obsession with excellence and whose hunger for greatness remind us that we should all be unsatisfied with mimicking the popular rather than mining the fertile veins of creativity that god placed deep inside each of

cupid donner and wolf blitzer let s head to the roof from there they would spring these deers had magical powers and all of them had wings now i took off my glasses cause this was too weird big bucks turned into ducks is what seemed to appear hey they circled around and i swear that they flew these deer had bags of my garbage and big willy in there too and then in a a flash they was tearing up my roof i heard the stompin and chompin of each little hoof as i drew out my pistol not knowing what to say down the fireplace came willy he must have got away he had on a mink coat from his bandana to his foot and his clothes were all nasty covered it ashes and soot he had my bag of garbage flung over his back and he looked like a fat raccoon lookin for a snack as i stood there wondering why he was not in bed i yelled hey i don t have any cookies you crazy knuckle head his mouth was wide open as he stood there in shock then i realized i was in my tighty whites with only a top alright quit

hey willy loves his jelly willy s chubby and plump like a fat little mouse and i got tickled at seeing him and said why are you at my house he winked at me and smiled as he set down his stash i saw it was not my garbage and it certainly was not my trash hey this cat didn t say a word as he pulled out some toys and not just cheap crap this stuff was for big boys he was doing a job and he was going to work this could not be willy because willy he s a jerk he left me some goodies then he sprang in the air i wasn t sure what i just saw but hey i didn t care and i heard him yell out as he left with

steaming cup and told her to sit at the table and sup but after she left he was filled with dismay for he saw that the hours were slipping away and the lord hadn t come as he said he would then conrad felt sure he had misunderstood when out of the stillness he heard a cry please help me and tell me where am i so again he opened his friendly door and stood disappointed as twice before it was only a child who d wandered away and was lost from her family on christmas day again conrad s heart was heavy and sad but he knew he should make the little girl glad so he called her in and he wiped her tears and quieted all her childish fears then he led her back to her home once more but as he entered his own darkened door he knew the lord was not coming today for the hours of christmas had passed away so he went to his room and knelt down to pray and he said dear lord why did you delay what kept you from coming to call on me for i wanted so much your face to see when soft in the silence a voice he heard lift up your head for i kept my word three times my shadow crossed your floor and three times i came to your lonely door i was the beggar with bruised cold feet and i was the woman you gave something to eat i was the child on the homeless street three times i knocked and three times i came in and each time i found the warmth of a friend of all the gifts love is the best and i was honored to be your christmas guest","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m dreaming of a white christmas just like the ones i used to know where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells

down dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound so i tried to write rhymes something like them my boys said that ain t you ice that shit sounds like them so i sat back thought up a new track didn t fantasize kicked the pure facts motherfuckers got scared cause they was unprepared who would tell it how it really was who dared a motherfucker from the west coast l a south central fool where the crips and the bloods play when i wrote about parties it didn t fit 6 n the mornin that was the real shit o g original gangster when i wrote about parties someone always died when i tried to write happy yo i knew i lied cause i lived a life of crime why play ya blind a simple look and anyone with two cents would know i m a hardcore player from the streets rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats a little different than the average though jet you through the fast lane drop ya on death row cause anybody who s been there knows that life ain t so lovely on the blood soaked fast track that invincible shit don t work throw ya in a joint you ll be coming out feet first so i blast the mic with my style sometimes i m ill and other times buckwild but the science is always there i d be a true sucker if i acted like i didn t care i rap for brothers just like myself dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth but i kick it to you hard and real one wrong move and your cap s peeled i ain t no super hero i ain t no marvel comic but when it comes to game i m atomic at dropping it straight point blank and untwisted no imagination needed cause i lived it this ain t no fucking joke this shit is real to me i m ice t o g  two weeks ago i was out at the disco two brothers stepped up to me and said hey yo ice we don t think you re down what set ya claiming e drew the glock yo my set s aiming dumb motherfucker try to roll on me please i m protected by a thousand emcees and hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls we won t even count the girls cause they got my back and i got theirs too fight for the streets when i m on oprah or donahue they try to sweat a nigga but they just didn t figure that my wit s as quick as a hair trigger he s not your everyday type prankster i m ice t the original gangster so step to me if you think that you re ready to got on your bullet proof well mine s going right thru this ain t no game to me it s hollow fame to me without respect from streets so i don t claim be the hardest motherfucker on earth catch me slipping i can t even get worked but i don t slip that often there s a coffin waiting for the brother who comes off soft when the real fucking shit goes down take a look around all them pussies can be found they talk a mean fight but fight like hoes i m from south central fool where everything goes snatch you out your car so fast you ll get whiplash numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass gangbangers don t carry no switchblades every kid s got a tec 9 or a hand grenade thirty seven
