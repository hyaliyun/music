there because foundations are secure because this nation we know what the foundation is it s all over the constitution it s all over the walls of the jefferson memorial the lincoln memorial it s written throughout history regardless of what the politicians believe regardless of what you and i attest to truth is truth the founding fathers built it on the truth of the word of god everything about the laws of this land were taken from the scripture from old testament they were right from the old testament books of the law and so you can t move away from that foundation without destroying the nation and so this whole debate and argument over what s truth and what s not truth the only truth that founded this nation we left a country of tyranny for religious freedom to worship and god s not afraid of who or how you worship because he knows sooner or later if you re truly seeking you ll see him god s not insecure he s confident and so we need to come to him see him as he is and that s true worship because in the midst of that all securities are made clear and all fears are relieved","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i no dey denge denge i no dey pose eh my baby give me biscuit i want

drag you wore an armor that covered your face it s life in drag i wore hands high to show truce and embracing it s life in drag who taught you how to hate your self who forced you to confide in spell mistook pathetic for empathy cast a stone at the foe and the stone hit me i held your hand in ritual to show disarming while you were a weapon inside your self inside your body oh i can t pretend i can t conceal my apprehension when pressed against the callous of your palm i reconciled because you couldn t feel me there and you wore binary like a badge of fucking honor while i struggled dealing

you apart constricting the free beating of your heart i knew your postcard would say wish you could stay wish you felt the same way  asked to be admitted and they put a lock on your door subdued medicated face to linoleum floor and you tried to break away painted window panes bars behind the glass molded to the frame you saw yourself in those days you felt buried from the start tearing you apart constricting the free beating of your heart i knew your postcard would say wish you could stay wish you felt the same way i am tearing up pieces of old news to mend the leaks in my open wounds protect your pressure points i refuse to press against let yourself renew project the voice that i found for you pull up the weeds from the ground you grew feel soil under your toes its you you have forever i felt weaker when i bent beaten to the end folding on myself too damaged to mend i couldnt hold all the weight you felt buried from the start tearing you apart injuring yourself dragging from

but before he fell he spoke to the angels up there to confuse and compel them one final attempt to steal glory from god he made up the untruest of tales and said he was a god and he blinded their eyes with his music like using a veil and one third of the angels believed and pursuing his trail they got booted as well and got sent to the earth like he s like a lion just roaming and moving his tail and now those angels are demons and they have conformed and committed to do what he tells them he s so stupid he s doin the same thing he did up in heaven and you couldn t tell but instead of getting angels to earth now he s tryna get humans to hell the music in your radio is big big bigger than you ever knew i promise i mma tell the truth kids i ll say a prayer to cover you my friend but i can t

pioneered by a man named don wasserman and i had the honor to learn directly from don he would use acoustic sounds to guide the sensation of the meditation i have expanded to the synthesizer so i ll be at my keyboard to help guide these sensations let s start with the face this is a very busy part of our body this is mission control a lot of senses meet at this nexus and there s quite a bit of activity there s a constant chatter in this region constant computation and it s very loud but you may not notice it like a refrigerator that s running and suddenly shuts off that quiet chatter is constantly happening and it s good this is how we decide how we go about our day but it is important to have some control over this chatter for example let s gently roll some of the high end off this chatter it s important to examine this chatter these are your thoughts they say the unexamined life is not worth living well the unexamined thoughts it s not worth thinking you might move these thoughts forward from behind your eyes and mind just a few feet in front of you and just just look at them see what see what they re up to see what they re saying after all they re your thoughts you might notice the thoughts gently orbiting around your head until they re a few feet in back of your head and they gently fade away this chatter and you re left just experiencing what is currently happening i like to think of a dog meditating a deep inhale release sense a smile spreading through the eyes and with a gentle listening and receptivity aware of the ass this is a chance to check in i studied with a great teacher who would refer to this as the ha ha region listening to and feeling whatever mood is here without judgement an honest contact much like the chatter we re unaware of our ass most of the day you might add in an ambience around your ass experience this new space feel this new sense of freedom to exist with with ya ass","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"look around at

sit in my room you know and just stare at the ceiling just trying to understand life you know i m tired of hurting just wanna be a better person i m sorry i m not who i used to be i guess i used to be a sucker for love but i promise ain t no more using me i used to love you like it was two of me but i really can t be mad because im glad of what i grew to be i guess thats how it goes usually i write this eulogy for you and me with these said stipulations you know in order for you to grow you have to stop watering dead situations even though in your heart you may feel sad inside but that pain is only temporary theres no need to agonize one day you ll be glad it died and satisfied knowing that you did all that you can do so what if nobody understands you all that matters is that you learn to light your own candle in other words the light inside so that when times get dark you can always see things on the brighter side because you have that light inside i guess that s how it go you know we live and we learn we grow through what we grow through but don t let life break you dont let failed relationships make you harder because when you do you loose your happiness you lose your sense of love and how to love you know and create your own happiness happiness reliant on anybody others than yourself is only temporary and love yourself its a cold world our here nobody really wants to be alone and its human nature to be passionate but when somebody continues to hurt you why do you accept them back again are you willing to sacrifice a few months in exchange for your happiness maybe you re also afraid of being alone and thats the only things thats stopping you but its never too late or impossible to find love in solitude i know it may bother you and inside of you it may feel like when doves cry but sometimes it s more than okay for you to let go and maybe let love die and honestly sometimes i sit in my room and i cry myself to sleep trying not to let these suicidal thoughts get the best of me i really don t believe love and relationships are in my destiny because everybody that i ve been with has made a complete mess of me so i really don t think i have much left in me i know god is only testing me but i m still here in this deep depression i guess i did nt learn the first time and so i have to repeat the lesson you know everything in life comes with a deeper message but deep inside of me i m still trying to fight the feelings of leaving this world even though i know i have a right to live it this really can t be the life i m living and i remember that night so vivid you left me in the street with blood in my eyes without a care in the world like you had nothing inside i guess thats what i get for trusting your lies see man like life is a roller coaster i guess you know but i guess its worth the ride you know theres ups and downs theres trials and tribulations theres hurt theres pain and there is happiness you know but all of this help us become better people and we all have suicidal thoughts at least in my world we do in this world there is no escape the only escape is within you you have to dig deep inside of you and find that thing that makes you happy find that thing that totally fulfill you in life because life is all about self fulfillment no body else can fill your cup it is up to you to fill your own cup and that is the purpose of life self fulfillment and learning to love yourself you know we all go through the same things i am no different from you i am no different from you love is what binds us it s unfortunate that those that say they love us prove otherwise through their actions and thats when you have you separate yourself from all the negativity and all the toxic situations and all the toxic relationships and work on you because at the end of the day man and woman its all about you its all about you yeah i pray for your healing i pray for your happiness all abundance its going to be okay

because he loves music that s the only thing he won t betray he cannot live a normal life it s been at that or suicide i d rather die than work a job around barely getting by it s a movement this music headphones on and just lose it i ve got one shot like eminem said in his movie can you see what i want now is it coming across your mind that i m built for one thing and that s to rhyme no more
