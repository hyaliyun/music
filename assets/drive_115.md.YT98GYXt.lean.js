the darkness i m skydiving gone airborne kept me grounded i m in flight i can sense some change in the atmosphere surrounded by these divine skies disobeyed and betrayed you i m taking a slight detour holding on for dear life with or without you i ll endure clutching onto a broken compass nowhere to be found only you know my location of my whereabouts somewhere along the way i lost sight of you i m still breathing at this altitude should i ever fall and let me fall with you as my parachute should i ever fall and let me fall with you as my parachute need you now more than ever the show ain t over but i m taking a bow knew i didn t belong but your love knows no bounds you were like the castle and palaces i found solace and refuge in i m desperate need assistance til my ghostly eclipse vanishes release the haze i m under grown resentful and stubborn pride comes before the fall like anakin skywalker was bruised beaten and crushed hush begun a gradual descent will gently land as i take a fearsome plunge you saw the flaw in my star you never fled or wavered when i went astray you saved me in one flew swoop like a cape crusader heard you say dive so i dove and swiftly began to plummet through it all you re all i need when i land i ll hit the ground running  with you as my parachute","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"it s the sweet taste of reward is it better than it was before she s a

something that in my memory has been misplaced suddenly all comes back and as i look to the stars i remember the time i knew a girl from mars i don t know if you knew that oh we d stay up late playing cards henri winterman cigars and she never told me her name i still love you the girl from mars surging through the darkness over the moonlight strand electricity in the air twisting all through the night on the terrace now that summer s here i know that you are almost in love with me i can see it in your eyes strange light shimmering over the sea tonight and it almost blows my mind and as i look to the stars i remember the time i knew a girl from mars i don t know if you knew that oh we d stay up late playing cards henri winterman cigars and she never told me her name i still love you the girl from mars  today i sleep in the chair by the window it felt as if you d returned i thought that you were standing over me when i woke there was no one there i still love you the girl from mars do you remember the time i knew a girl from mars i don t know if you knew that oh we d stay up late playing cards henri winterman cigars but she never told me her name do you remember the time i knew a

search has begun i ve come to see where my beginnings have gone oh the walls and the windows were still standing and the music could be heard at the door where the people who kindly endured my odd questions asked if i came very far and when my silence replied they took me inside where their children sat playing on the floor well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on and it left me so warm and so high but as i stepped back outside to the grey morning sun i heard that highway whisper and sigh are you ready to fly and i looked into the faces all passing by it s an ocean that will never be filled and the house that grows older and finally crumbles that even love cannot rebuild it s a hotel at best you re here as a guest you oughta make yourself at home while you re waiting for the rest well i looked into the dreams of the millions that one day the search will be through now here i stand at the edge of my embattled illusions looking into you ah the great song traveler passed through here and he opened my eyes to the view and i was among those who call him a prophet and i asked him what was true until the distance had shown how the road remains alone now i m looking in my life for the truth that is my own  well i looked into the sky for my anthem and the words and the music came through but words and music will never touch the beauty that i ve seen looking into you and that s true1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m ready to flee to a better place go west south and east whatever the way let s make a move hurry up lets go now you got to believe we can get away

to hear her react and she says man the farther we run the harder we act like in the backseat looking at me holding me like you wont let up and leave me alone but how could that be wait look i cant breathe im knocked down but strong enough to shout that youre an animal and you cant stop the habits that form and i told you they run when you call and if you had to crawl on back theyd ask nothing

middle of the night and say take me like you know i like it and well make believe that waiting wasn t wasted time and like an animal i ran into your wrecking ball and i crashed into the record wall
