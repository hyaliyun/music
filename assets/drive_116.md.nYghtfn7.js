to the point where they ruled the planet but rome greece and persia wasn t havin it they attacked and won the war but it wasn t enough they had to get to the core cause in that time it was alkebulan that ruled religion politics and man in order to destroy the egyptian race they had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet so they proceeded to ban it then replace it with christianity and it s been that way all the way to today learn what we teach hear what we say but here comes the k the r the s the o the n the e the bdp and we rhyme intelligently let me continue with theodosius a greek ruler not known to most of us he in the fourth century a d closed the egyptian schools you see two years later justinian rules six a d was it for schools as a result ignorance had swirled over christian europe and greco roman worlds this went on for a thousand years of ignorance stupidity and tears now comes the seventeenth century hardness europe began to come out of it s darkness so johann f blumenbach a german came out of nowhere and started confirming white supremacy and men of colors before this time all men were brothers it was johann who went on to say there are five different colors in the world today that s caucasian malayan and mongolian american indian and ethiopian yet the ignorance gets scarier he believed whites were superior according to his idiotic fountain the purest whites were from the caucas mountains j a blofener and h s chamberlain both supported this outrageous racism this went on to what the master race should be and why they killed the jews in germany here is the reason why i m so concerned because you must learn 4","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"ain t no love ain t no love like my baby s love it s like burning fire a torch shut up in

conscientiously his diction was perfect elocution great to describe his speech words are inadequate he said we who plant the cane and dig the oil and develop the estates with sweat and toil while employers are living luxuriously why should we die in misery  his speech created a sensation and was welcome by the population there is a rumor he will be recalled by the commissioners he has been

the atmosphere one sunday morning i chanced to hear a rumbling and a tumbling in the atmosphere i ran to stare people were flocking everywhere gesticulating and gazing and pointing in the air it was the graf zeppelin which had come to pay a visit to trinidad i gazed at the zeppelin contemplatively and marveled at mans ingenuity the whirring of the engines were all i heard as it floated in the air like some giant bird and in between as the mighty airship gleamed the pilot and the sailors and the passengers were seen they were waving little flags which they had heralding their visit to trinidad i gazed and the knowledge came back to me how wonderful the work of man can be to see that huge object in the air maintaining perfect equilibrium in the atmosphere wonderfully beautifully gloriously decidedly defying all the laws of gravity was the graf zeppelin which had come to pay a visit to trinidad as i gazed at the zeppelin something touched meh hand i turned and saw an old decrepit coolie

hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling hed had the same dream before his aunt was back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and dont you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table was almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday presents it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag was harry but he couldnt often catch him harry didnt look it but he was very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley was about four times bigger than he was harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parents died she had said and dont ask questions dont ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there wasnt much room dudley meanwhile was counting his presents his face fell thirty six he said looking up at his mother and father thats two less than last year darling you havent counted auntie marges present see its here under this big one from mummy and daddy all right thirty seven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two presents while were out today hows that popkin two more presents is that all right dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirty thirty nine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke wants his moneys worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mrs figgs broken her leg she cant take him she jerked her head in harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to adventure parks hamburger restaurants or the movies every year harry was left behind with mrs figg a mad old lady who lived two streets away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mrs figg made him look at photographs of all the cats shed ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry as though hed planned this harry knew he ought to feel sorry that mrs figg had broken her leg but it wasnt easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbles snowy mr paws and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested dont be silly vernon she hates the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this as though he wasnt there or rather as though he was something very nasty that couldnt understand them like a slug what about whats her name your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully aunt petunia looked as though shed just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruins she snarled i wont blow up the house said harry but they werent listening i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that cars new hes not sitting in it alone dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wasnt really crying it had been years since hed really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums dont cry mummy wont let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arms around him i dont want him t t to come dudley yelled between huge pretend sobs he always sp spoils everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms just then the doorbell rang oh good lord theyre here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend piers polkiss walked in with his mother piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he was usually the one who held peoples arms behind their backs while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who couldnt believe his luck was sitting in the back of the dursleys car with piers and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle hadnt been able to think of anything else to do with him but before theyd left uncle vernon had taken harry aside im warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys im warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and youll be in that cupboard from now until christmas im not going to do anything said harry honestly but uncle vernon didnt believe him no one ever did the problem was strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didnt make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadnt been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he couldnt explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly wouldnt fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wasnt punished on the other hand hed gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens dudleys gang had been chasing him as usual when as much to harrys surprise as anyone elses there he was sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings but all hed tried to do was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid jump but today nothing was going to go wrong it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasnt school his cupboard or mrs figgs cabbage smelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about things people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects this morning it was motorcycles roaring along like maniacs the young hoodlums he said as a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it was flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycles dont fly dudley and piers sniggered i know they dont said harry it was only a dream but he wished he hadnt said anything if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldnt no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wasnt bad either harry thought licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wasnt blond harry had the best morning hed had in a long time he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime wouldnt fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didnt have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it was all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it was cool and dark in there with lit windows all along the walls behind the glass all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone dudley and piers wanted to see huge poisonous cobras and thick man crushing pythons dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it didnt look in the mood in fact it was fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coils make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake didnt budge do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he wouldnt have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes slowly very slowly it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching they werent he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised its eyes to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wasnt sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil was it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen was bred in the zoo oh i see so youve never been to brazil as the snake shook its head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you wont believe what its doing dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the ribs caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howls of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictors tank had vanished the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits as the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanksss amigo the keeper of the reptile house was in shock but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again piers and dudley could only gibber as far as harry had seen the snake hadnt done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least was piers calming down enough to say harry was talking to it werent you harry uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry he was so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meals before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he didnt know what time it was and he couldnt be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he couldnt risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food hed lived with the dursleys almost ten years ten miserable years as long as he could remember ever since hed been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash he couldnt remember being in the car when his parents had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead this he supposed was the crash though he couldnt imagine where all the green light came from he couldnt remember his parents at all his aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he was forbidden to ask questions there were no photographs of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought that strangers in the street seemed to know him very strange strangers they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wild looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"it s barely yours on loan what you think you own the place that you call home the ideas in your bones in your bones this would still feel dumb back

here to watch me im not demonstrateing all the classic emcee characteristics cept the words thick as hair your chest gets im dressed a mystfit always in a shabby outfit none of these ragedy old clothes in my closet still fit and shit id definitely have been wearin the same pair of pants forever josie hadnt of stepped in but i keep my boots laced i got my tooth paste everything i care about can fit inside of one suit case and im not trying to rhyme about the same ol same ol or just trying to change the place where i stay on the pay roll a year ago i was broke me and my girl go dutch dont look at myself in the mirror too much and such is the way of things recently release the beast in me with two or three pbrs and some weed and i become and pretty decent emcee but sometimes that still aint enough man this aint a rat race im not running for cheese dog im hunting down a place to be im not down with the streets its more like im down with the freaks and all the class clowns man yo the geeks but all this shit that i spit just aint spittin for me sometimes i wish that it was so it would flow more easily but everything that i speak is a tiny little piece of these parts of myself that i place over these beats i emcee or at least thats what i strive to be and you can believe no ones harder on myself than me cause i gotta feel rightfully that ive earned all these things and i work hard as the people i got working with me they got mouths to feed see they gotta eat thats the type of hunger that drives my heart to stay hungry my necessities are just some jeans and a t but go shopping do your thing ill be fine in these  so if my clothes no go with the story you been told bout hip hop or if it looks like i dont sport enough gold understand that was never my goal thats not my role so that is not how i roll ill keep on flowing on top or unknown i seen both all i can do is stay up and keep going man i been spitting half my life in clothes i bought at half price and given half the chance id rap one handed holding half a mic and in half a night i might become irrelevant so all this shit around me you can sell it the hell with it its evident ive never had the frame

to has graciously offered his services for this afternoon s demonstration his medulla oblongata tells his brain stem that it s gotta send an impulse full of data which creates a lotta pain his frontal lobe gets busy with a thought that makes him dizzy puts his cortex in a tizzy so he never will complain that s what i love about the brain mr hilltop will you raise your left knee please you have just witnessed a voluntary nerve impulse mr hilltop you may lower your knee reflex movements on the other hand are those which are made independently of the will why you dirty rotten yellow son of a bitch mr hilltop ooooh frederick even though i almost kneed him his reflexes have no freedom to react when i mistreat him it s important i explain synaptic nerve connection goes its way without detection bringing cranial protection in a never ending chain that s what i love about the brain but what if we were to block those nerve impulses by simply aplying local pressure which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp just at the swelling of the posterior nerve root for say oh four seconds why you mother grabbing bastard as you can see even though i have just smashed my knee into his crotch he does not react he feels absolutely nothing mr hilltop mmmm frederick more or less so if it were not for this continuous stream of motor impulses from the brain we would collapse like a bunch of broccoli mr hilltop oooooh frederick and in conclusion so there s no confusion let me say it once again though your genitalia has been known to fail ya you can bet your ass on the brain everybody

our house and collapsed at our door strangled as an empty christmas stocking wailing for her piece of coal i have never seen a person so finished with god her face was a massacre of grief her cries like shoveled granite chewed through her shrilling throat all they left was the flag she kept screaming i thought her lungs would start bleeding it scraped my chest clean hollowed me for weeks our house was the echo of a mother clawing the floorboards for her dead son a downed forest in her nail beds at night i obsessed over how long flowers might survive in the hands of thieves spent a month scouring for answers in our basement in the photographs of my father in vietnam he was as thin as a blade his eyes unfiltered as the cancer they were given for free anyone could see but the freckles in his shame that war was no place for a soldier the heart is no place for the talons of the kind of secrets you can only keep in the same chamber you will keep loaded to keep your hands from shaking the ghosts of dead children awake my uncle wasnt killed by a bullet he drank himself to sleep trying to drown out their tiny screams my grandmother followed him to the grave like every mother does i keep thinking of them today as i sit in my parents living room my father has been home from the hospital for a week but i was just told he spent 3 years in a field of agent orange but is refusing to accept his 10 veterans medical discount because a true patriot knows cost of war pays for it himself i have written this poem before but always through a window never through an open door i find my mother by the stove stirring spaghetti sauce from a jar i have never heard her breathing pull this hard earlier in the car while my father broke down she turned up the radio dial to save him the embarrassment of his whimper the radio was playing i wanna sex you up we listened to it at full volume for three minutes it was fucking hilarious how none of us heard the word i dont hear the words anymore the president announces the end of a war and i just stare at my mothers eyes as my fathers face falls into the trembling trench of his hands like a boy fresh out of bootcamp who has just dropped his gun into somebodys cradle when a war ends what does that look like exactly do the cells and bodies stop detonating themselves does the orphanage stop screaming for its mother when the sand in the desert is melted down to glass and our reflection is not something we can stand to look at does a white flag make for a perfect blindfold yesterday i heard a story about a 6 year old girl in iraq who cant sleep because when she does she dreams of nothing but the day she watched her dog eat her neighbors corpse if you told her the war was over do you think shed sleep shes seen teeth rip through a ribcage and swallow a heart and i can buy dog tags at the mall i can buy camouflage at the gap i can stare at the vietnam wall and forget it is missing the 2 million names of the 2 million vietnamese slain so i can certainly forget about the little girl her dog the neighbor and whichever soldiers we choke chained in the opposite direction of god at 4 am i find my father in the living room the news caster says that the number of us soldiers killed in war this month was outdone by the number that came home and committed suicide outside there is a flag waving from our front door my father picked it out as carefully as he picked out my name when he built our house i want to tell him that i still build my spine from the clothesline that holds his work shirts but i know id start crying i am exactly like him we both have wrinkles around our eyes a hundred years older than our age we both carry ourselves like ambulances with someone dead inside hoping well get there in time i didnt get here in time this house echoes like an empty canteen flowers dont survive long in the hands of thieves so much is wilting i look out the window my fathers flag is a glow in the moonlight i remember something i was told many years ago i was told in world war ii 80 of us soldiers could not bring themselves to kill an enemy soldier they found sleeping sleeping i want to ask my father if he thinks that is true but i know he wont sleep if i do and he needs to sleep god knows we all do","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"tonight in iraq there is a race to rape little girls before they can be

but his empty chair if you are a nation under god how is hell so close to your prayers do you see what you are pressing against your bones bones cannot break into song a mother can never find the right place to store an empty cradle a mouth can never find the right shape to hold the lullabies it will never sing america if you could rip the pipelines from your throat if you could hang them like wind chimes from the battered night would you remember how freedom rings would you remember that every river is a lantern running without oil and your children sing your anthems so proud america the beautiful remember when you melted the desert the sand became a mirror if you could stand so close the flames caught the lashes of your eyes if you could memorize one face fading into smoke and never

wondering what the hell is past the line of the solar system and you re thinking to yourself geez this is an incredible life as you try to look deep into the delicate night smoking weed wondering if you re inhaling it right and you wanna know do distant planets have intelligent life well of course they do and they might have big red eyes or big green thumbs or skin light blue but a lot of them
