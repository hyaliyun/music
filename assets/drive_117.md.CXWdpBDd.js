the debate is about to proponents intelligent design is the notion that the universe is too complex to have developed without a nudge from a higher power than evolution or natural selection to detractors intelligent design is creationism the literal interpretation of the book of genesis in a thin guise or simply vacuous about as interesting as i dont understand as has always been true in the sciences before understanding is reached accordingly there cannot be a debate the teaching of evolution has long been difficult in the united states now a national movement has emerged to promote the teaching of intelligent design in schools the issue has famously surfaced in a courtroom in dover pa where a school board is requiring students to hear a statement about intelligent design in a biology class and parents mindful of the constitutions church state separation have sued the board in the interest of fairness perhaps the presidents speechwriters should take him seriously when they have him say that schools should be open minded and teach all points of view so far however the curriculum has not encompassed one obvious point of view malignant design unlike intelligent design for which the evidence is zero malignant design has tons of empirical evidence much more than darwinian evolution by some criteria the worlds cruelty be that as it may the background of the current evolution intelligent design controversy is the widespread rejection of science a phenomenon with deep roots in american history that has been cynically exploited for narrow political gain during the last quarter century intelligent design raises the question whether it is intelligent to disregard scientific evidence about matters of supreme importance to the nation and world like global warming an old fashioned conservative would believe in the value of enlightenment ideals rationality critical analysis freedom of speech freedom of inquiry and would try to adapt them to a modern society the founding fathers children of the enlightenment championed those ideals and took pains to create a constitution that espoused religious freedom yet separated church and state the united states despite the occasional messianism of its leaders isnt a theocracy in our time the bush administrations hostility to scientific inquiry puts the world at risk environmental catastrophe whether you think the world has been developing only since genesis or for eons is far too serious to ignore in preparation for the g8 summit this past summer the scientific academies of all g8 nations joined by those of china india and brazil called on the leaders of the rich countries to take urgent action to head off global warming the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify prompt action their statement said it is vital that all nations identify cost effective steps that they can take now to contribute to substantial and long term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions in its lead editorial the financial times endorsed this clarion call while observing there is however one holdout and unfortunately it is to be found in the white house where george w bush insists we still do not know enough about this literally world changing phenomenon dismissal of scientific evidence on matters of survival in keeping with bushs scientific judgment is routine a few months earlier at the 2005 annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science leading us climate researchers released the most compelling evidence yet that human activities are responsible for global warming according to the financial times they predicted major climatic effects including severe reductions in water supplies in regions that rely on rivers fed by melting snow and glaciers other prominent researchers at the same session reported evidence that the melting of arctic and greenland ice sheets is causing changes in the seas salinity balance that threaten to shut down the ocean conveyor belt which transfers heat from the tropics toward the polar regions through currents such as the gulf stream such changes might bring significant temperature reduction to northern europe like the statement of the national academies for the g8 summit the release of the most compelling evidence yet received scant notice in the united states despite the attention given in the same days to the implementation of the kyoto protocols with the most important government refusing to take part it is important to stress government the standard report that the united states stands almost alone in rejecting the kyoto protocols is correct only if the phrase united states excludes its population which strongly favours the kyoto pact perhaps only the word malignant could describe a failure to acknowledge much less address the all too scientific issue of climate change thus the moral clarity of the bush administration extends to its cavalier attitude toward the fate of our grandchildren","artist_name":"The Evidence"},{"lyrics":"she s an underdog lives next door to me she s always heard you won t amount to anything and it kills me to watch the agony beyond her eyes

trust what if i m fucking that up so you don t trust in me much i m wasting your time to say i m straight i d be lying it s either you or this music but i can t make up my mind i d throw you a line i d give you a sign right now i m through with the trying i think you ready to fly i settle for less so when i m tired of stress i go through the motions pretending i m at my best fall victim to flesh i live to be fresh but this ain t what i expect because my life is a wreck i run out of breath cause i ain t taking the steps money comes and it goes til family s all i got left i m seeing my growth but i m still from myself you ll be hollering out next because you re ready to fly i can t find the words so you ll just fill in the blanks i m doing the norm and not what it takes i ll keep folding my cards and you ll keep raising the stakes til we forget about us and what we have is too late i know in your heart you ain t conditioned to race so i steady the wheel forever pumping the brakes resort to the bottle that s how i deal with the shakes pray for these haters that s how i deal with the hate look to the sky don t be content with the now you ain t concerned with the why you just wanna know how i didn t give it a chance when you just wanna be down and save me from myself but i m wanting to drown king is much more than the weight of a crown as good as it feels that ain t the way that it sounds being single is cool til ain t nobody around then i m chasing you down cause you was ready to fly i can t be what you want me to be you re shooting too high cause you ain t aiming at me one minute you re calling out for the d then the next minute you wanna be free then the next minute you hollering out peace although i know it s a war and there ll be blood in the street if you call don t be frustrated at me just leave you re heart at the beep cause mine is harder to reach cause mine is harder to see and that don t make it harder to cheat being friends would make it harder to breathe so if you ready to fly just forget about me but if you willing to try then i m willing to leap out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet i ain t the man you want me to be i guess that s what s been bothering me11","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"you blew fire in my heart when i was frowned you laid me coffins and laced them with gowns and how i did lick that spot on your neck that sent

in a zoo he lived there too for two years and a half he hasn t had a bath my mommy doesn t lick me even when i m sticky from candy floss candy apples popcorn and soft drinks jelly beans and gumdrops there must be something better than living in this cage but i m really not too sure because i m rather short of age joshua giraffe was feeling kind of sad things were going bad how little of life he had wasting away with no room to play trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo so he went next door to the elephant and asked him what to do i m wasting away with no room to play i m trapped in a zoo with buffalo poo the elephant was very old and gray and he had a huge balloon bottom and he said never fear joshua for a vision will appear that night a dream came to joshua and joshua saw animals like crazy monkeys and a whole pile of hippypotostropasuses and flitty moths frogs size twelve and sleazy lizards and a tribe of nasty saviars but joshua wasn t afraid because he sang himself this song  nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo nothing can go wrong o i m in the congo even in his dream he knew he d never get away not even for a day then a peanut hit him on the nose joshua giraffe was back in the zoo what could he do awakened from his dream he d never be the same because of things he d seen he d seen alligators crocodiles tree sloths anacondas cobras and large winged moths orangutans gorillas baboons eating grapes gibbons rude mandrills and just plain apes but joshua was lucky he had some special friends and that day they went to the zoo but he was up tight so they waited till the night and they chopped his cage in two he discovered he could fly and he soared into the sky with them wrapped around his neck and they haven t come back yet so if you see them get a net funicello ho ho oh ho ho ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho ho ho oh ho ho oh ho ho that s right they haven t come back yet but when they do they say they re going to free all the animals from their cages no matter how new or modern even some pets too so if on your way home today you happen to find a baboon basking in the balcony or a lion licking a lemon in the lobby or a python perched in the pantry a wildebeest in the w c with a turtle twirling in your tub don t be afraid just say you re a friend of their friend joshua giraffe joshua joshua joshua giraffe joshua joshua

playing games within my mind like the embers as they die love was one prolonged goodbye and it all comes back to me tonight in the gloom like an angel passing through my room i close my eyes and my
