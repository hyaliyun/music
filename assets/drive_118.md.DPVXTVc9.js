a pussy s good for maybe six or seven at the most and i m sure they can t compare as far as taste mrs lovett what a charming notion eminently practical and yet appropriate as always well it does seem a waste mrs lovett how i ve lived without you all these years it s an idea i ll never know how delectable also undetectable how choice how rare think about it lots of other gentlemen ll soon be coming

yes all around it s man devouring man my dear and who are we to deny it in here ah these are desperate times mrs lovett and desperate measures must be taken here we are now hot out of the oven what is that it s priest have a little priest is it really good sir it s too good at least then again they don t commit sins of the flesh so it s pretty fresh awful lot of fat only where it sat haven t you

fuck not worried about my ashes that one day will turn to dust not thinking that i should listen just wanna be feeling great doesnt matter whats the prison rest assured i will

the sky seemed to spell out a greeting as the children flew by a guard in a chariot of silver and gold gave the children all tickets then the story he told of a time in the future that was sunshine and flowers and the children grew sleepy in the sky s white towers they dreamed of the story that the guard had displayed they saw all the wonders tiny minds were amazed they saw candy forests and dragons that breathed fire on all that was evil in the misty mire they came to the village where the turtles in caves made pies for the people and the lemonade the people lived out by the sea and each day the seagulls would wake them as they passed on their way the people were kindly they would sing to the sky and each bright new morning the sun shone from their eyes the children passed over and all the people could see as they dived from the sky to the treacle sea they bathed on the white sand minutes turned into hours and the children all giggled and gave each other flowers the king from his castle came down to the sea and he spoke to the children so patiently he gave them small presents and bid them farewell and the children unwrapped them tiny silver bells their tinkling floated across the island with ease and it came back toward them on the perfume breeze they smiled at the tinkling they gazed at the sun and they smiled at each other pretty little ones a beautiful white horse came down to the sea and the children all climbed up as he knelt on one knee they rode through the valleys and high over hills and they laughed oh so loudly their fear to kill they came to a lakeside of deep velvet and green and they all stared in wonder at its beauty serene they climbed from the white horse they watch as it goes as they stood by the green lake for to kiss their toes a boat in the distance was suddenly there waiting to take the children to anywhere the porcupine captain said that he didn t mind in his coat of black needles he looked very kind  his crew were six rabbits with fluffy white ears and the children all stroked them and lost all their fears they sailed through the sunshine across the green lake and they drank lemonade and they ate ice cream cake they landed in a dark cave as the boat disappeared and they all stood in darkness through the shadows they peered but out of the blackness shone diamonds so bright their tiny white hands shielded eyes from the light in a pool of quicksilver stood neptune so wise and pearls were his white teeth bright diamonds his eyes he spoke to the children in a voice of velvet and he beckoned them to him in a circle they sat he told of sky island and of his magic cave and magic pink seashells to the children he gave they listened intently as the music came far from the magic pink seashells and nobody talked but neptune had vanished when they lifted their eyes so they walked from the cave as two kingfishers cried in the bright shiny sunlight they got down on one knee they listened to the sea shells of the musical sea but the day grew much darker so they climbed on the breeze and they floated to the village and the people were pleased to see them so happy with their tinkling bells and the people all listened to the musical shells but the children were so sad the time had come to leave so the people waved goodbye and begged them to believe of the wonders they had seen in the island of the sky and the children said they would and away they did fly through the white clouds of no time til forever it seems and the children stayed children and they lived in their dreams1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"yeah yeah i come from the land where the mullet attacks business up front party in the back you got a style in the south when you steppin out put a gold tooth in

moment and a few rusty razor blades pinch she can feel them comin through she can t feel any emotion only feels when it breaks through damn she wishes she could see the light but never got the chance so she creeped into the night she would stay up contemplating if her life was worth the pain of a knife in a world full of wrongs tell me who s really right she s never sleepin she s scared when she closes her eyes that she might wake up in the morning in a puddle of cries she dried her eyes told her mother bye one last time snuck some pills out of the bathroom and waited to fly don t get a second chance lonely she stepped on her plans said goodbye to all her friends as she clenches her hands it s like damn  got this feeling that everything comes to an end i can feel it running again and

s lost in peaceful dreams so i turn out the lights and lay there in the dark and the thought crosses my mind if i never wake up in the morning would she ever doubt the way i feel about her in my heart if tomorrow never comes will she know how much i loved her did i try in every way to show her every day that she s my only one and if my time on earth were through and she must face the world without me is the love i gave her in the past gonna be enough to last if tomorrow never comes cause i ve lost loved ones in my life who never knew how much i loved them now i live with the regret that my true feelings for them never were revealed so i made a promise to myself to say each day how much she means to me and avoid that circumstance where there s no second chance to tell her how i feel if tomorrow never comes will she know how much i loved her did i try in every way to show her every day that she s my only one and if my time on earth were through and she must face the world without me is the love i gave her in the past gonna be enough to last if tomorrow never comes so tell that someone that you love just what you re thinking of if tomorrow never
