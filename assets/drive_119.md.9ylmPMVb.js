little sheep never make a peep so i m taking a stand and i m making demands and i ll stand even if i have to stand alone and say bring the troops back home with all of the beauty to behold in this world why would you want to feed the destruction with all of wonders to witness in this world why would you want to see armageddon with all of the things you could be in this world why would you go and be a soldier man oh oh oh oh i oh i i think i know why cause when you were 3 years old they put a toy gun in your hand and they showed you shows of g i joes how could you overstand the difference between fiction and reality oh if your parents knew how it impacted you they would ve burned the tvs but they were too busy working for the man and they were too busy just fitting into the plan so when you were 6 years old they put you in the boy scouts so harmless it seemed to be marching waving the flag about but they already got you wearing that uniform on your back using weapons earning medals gaining rank in your pack yeah it s the symbolism that keeps you coming back esoteric symbolism that they subconscious tap oh yes the symbolism keep you slipping through the cracks it s the symbolism got your mind under attack but youth put on your thinking cap don t get caught in their trap no with all of the creativity in this world why would you create nuclear weapons with all of

cause when you were 13 years old you joined the rotc your high school version of your immersion in the military they got you dreaming of that m16 in your hands heroically killing enemies for democracy in a foreign land why it s the mind control that keeps you killing blindly government mind control been going on for centuries so when you were 18 years old the recruiters came to your school with fancy dress and propaganda trying to make you their fool telling you you re never gonna amount to anything but look at all of the rewards and benefits uncle sam will bring just sign on the dotted line the officer says with a grin sign your name on the dotted line just there and we ll take you in just pick up the pen and sign we ll take care of everything sign your name on the dotted line and your bright future can begin but can you hear the bugle play as you sign your life away yeah oh lord give me one good reason give me one good outcome from all of this killing it don t make no sense oh so many are dying orphaned babies crying in the name of freedom what a false pretense oh with all the money all the power all the souls that you devour mr politician man it could never equal the power of jah love that i hold in the fingers of my pure clean hands so mr soldier man i m begging you come back home oh military man leave them war machines alone cause them politicians sit in their mansion reaping all the benefits while you lay dying in the trenches and they just don t give a shit no oh lord there s got to be a better way to communicate i don t believe that killing man makes us more safe lord i know the opposite is true oh how bout you do you buy into the news have they got you so confused but when i feel the pressure in the air i get so scared will we live to see another day another month another year how can i protect my family from these crazy leaders addicted to war tell em we don t need no more of these broken dreams and fantasies are falling down the well or daddy s

here alone if i close my eyes tonight i know i ll be home the year was 1941 i was eight years old and far far too young to know that the stories of battles and glory was a tale a kind mother made up for her son you see dad was a traveling preacher teachin the words of the teacher but mother had sworn he went off to the war and died there with honor somewhere on a beach there but he left once to never return which taught me that i should unlearn whatever i thought a father should be i abandoned that thought like he abandoned me by 47 i was fourteen i d acquired a taste for liquor and nicotine i smoked until i threw up yet i still lit em up for thirty more years like a machine so right there you have it that one filthy habit is what got me where i am today i can smell the death on the sheets covering me i can t believe this is the end i can hear those sad memories still haunting me so many things i d do again but this is my deathbed i lie here alone if i close my eyes tonight i know i ll be home got married on my twenty first eight months before my wife would give birth it s easier to be sure you love someone when her father inquires with the barrel of a gun the union was far from harmonious no two people could have been more alone than us the years would go by and she d love someone else and i realized i hadn t been loved yet myself from there it s your typical spiel yeah if life was a highway i was drunk at the wheel i was helping the loose ends all fall apart yeah i swear i was destined to fail and fail from the start i bowled about six times a week a bottle of beam kept the memories from me our marriage had taken a seven ten split and along with my pride the ex wife took the kids  i can smell the death on the sheets covering me i can t believe this is the end i can hear those sad memories still haunting me so many things i d do again but this is my deathbed i lie here alone if i close my eyes tonight i know i ll be home i was so scared of jesus but he sought me out like the cancer in my lungs that s killing me now and i ve given up hope on the days i have left but i cling to the hope of my life in the next then jesus showed up said before we go up i thought that we might reminisce see one night in your life when you turned out the lights you asked for and prayed for my forgiveness you cried wolf the tears they soaked your fur the blood dripped from your fangs you said what have i done you loved that lamb with every sinful bone and there you wept alone your heart was so contrite you said jesus please forgive me of my crimes sanctify this withered heart of mine stay with me until my life is through and on that day please take me home with you i can smell the death on the sheets covering me i can t believe this is the end i can hear you whisper to me it s time to leave you ll never be lonely again but this was my deathbed i died there alone when i closed my eyes tonight you carried me home i am the way follow me and take my hand and i am the truth embrace me and you ll understand and i am the life and through me you ll live again for i am love i am love i i am love5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"where do we go from here now that

not let go so i got out my ropes and a rusty clawfoot tub and i rigged myself a chariot to ride down in that hole my wife she did help me she fed me down the ropes and then i sank away from the surface of this world when the last rope pulled tight i had not reached the end and in anger i swung there down in that dark abyss so i got out my knife i told my wife goodbye i cut loose from the

into the leaden sky a man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers but awakes to a morning with no reason for waking hes haunted by the memory of a lost paradise in his youth or a dream he cant be precise hes chained forever to a world thats departed its not enough its not enough his blood has frozen and curdled with fright his knees have trembled and given way in the night his hand has weakened at the moment of truth his step has faltered one world one soul time pass the river roll and he talks to the river of lost love and dedication and silent replies that swirl invitation flow

gil scott herons you know they paved the way they set the pace they set the tone like the last poets all of these are great people great minds to do things to carry the torch of our ancestors to let us know whats really really going on around the world hip hop has definitely carried that torch in a positive way rap was a vehicle for stopping the violence just as jazz was back in the days back in the 60s back in the 30s quincy jones mccoy tyner grant green wes montgomery elvin jones miles davis eric gale phil sanders freddie hubbbard billy higgins jimmy smith wayne shorter ahmad jamal thelonius monk all big influences for what it is that we do and what it is that we are as we take our stance in music jazz was also like a secret conversation i mean it was a universal language so no matter what culture you came from you would still hear the music and feel the story even if you didnt know the words in hip hop we have to put our all into it so you can feel the energy coming across just the same as the saxophone player who played with the same intensity and feeling and thats what were all here for to feel that love and vibration in music to uplift the people indeed to uplift the

recognize his face oh lord not even recognize his face oh tell me my darling son pray tell me what they done how is it you come to be this way he tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move and the mother had to turn her face away dont you remember ma when i went off to war you thought it was the best thing i could do i was on the battleground you were home acting proud you wasnt there standing in my shoes oh and i thought when i was there god what am i doing here im a tryin to kill somebody or die tryin but the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close and i saw that his face looked just like mine oh lord just like mine and i couldnt help but think through the thunder rolling and stink that i was just a puppet in a play and through the roar and smoke this string

of time in my cave now worried that the drum breaks might lead to break downs venting on a song that s never ending lifting up the pen and pretending i m picking up the pace now but what s the point of runnin faster if you re only runnin laps you re so concerned about staying on the track you forget the finish line s the starting point you re coming back to so now i keep it how the crow flies

that the love they shared was true far away the fiddler s bowing the grass forever blue it was in the dead of winter when her man first caught the chill and he said he heard the angels singing cabin on the hill through the springtime he was groaning the good times are past and gone by the summer she was moaning love o lover please come home now she stands out in the midnight in the moonlight all aglow she prays to carter stanley won t you please tell bill monroe rather be in some dark holler or some dark deep shady grove than to be a bluegrass widow  i started listening to bluegrass music in bryan duckworth s rust red 1970 ford maverick had an eight track tape deck and an eight track tape of bill monroe s greatest hits we used to skip second period chemistry and go over to the shamrock station across the street from the high school and get a case of texas pride beer charge it on my dad s credit card and get em to write it up as oil so dad never knew the difference then we d ride around and drink texas pride listen to bill monroe soon we got to be bluegrass experts and we d stop in another shamrock station and get another texas pride case drink that and listen to the stanley brothers and then we d go get a tape of jim and jesse and it was on to the kentucky colonels and mack wiseman and the new grass revival peter rowan and finally i got the brilliant idea one day to take all the greatest bluegrass song titles in the world and string em together to make this song right here the bluegrass widow quite possibly the worst bluegrass song ever written i did this in tribute to the front porch boys which was a bluegrass band i was in in college station texas we were a little four piece band we played weddings and parties and out on the porch and beer joints and one weekend on a handful of cheap amphetamines we decided to go to crockett texas we entered the international bluegrass band competition and took second place we could play faster than anybody in the competition the other two bands took first and third respectively i met some friends and went off into the night separated from the front porch boys and met back up with them in the cold gray light of dawn as the bluegrass songs say they were standing underneath a giant pine tree there in crockett singing the rudest most grotesque nastiest bluegrass songs you ve ever heard in your life i m talking about the kind of song where not only is the character in the song dead by the end of the song but he s been dismembered as well and the front porch boys stopped and looked up at me just long enough to say we re taking bluegrass music where it s never been before and we re not taking you with us cause you don t have that high and lonesome sound that bluegrass music requires well i m not one to fight failure i packed up my stuff and left the front porch boys broke up three days later when they realized i owned the pa system will you miss me when i m gone were his final words to her darlin think of what you ve done then replied his knoxville girl and the leaves had started turning when his mind began to fail then he broke down in a breakdown now she wears a long black veil and she

ive never been super pumped on the name i didnt really know what else to call it other than just taking the words that i say most in the song and naming it i always get this weird like 80s rock vibe from the title of the song which has always bothered me but since then have gotten over i remember the riff for the song holding on to you i can see it now on the piano on the keys im very visual when i write music and i remember i accidentally jumped over a few notes when i was tryna figure out just the riff and i didnt think it worked then i listened to it again and actually the riff anticipates the chord progression in a really nice way and then i fell in love with it and then obviously this is one of our key tracks that has been on this album that josh and i the other guy in my band were a little we dont really know what it means exactly to have a single out because weve always just worked on a body of work but this is one of those songs where we have to introduce ourselves and say this is kind of who we are you know this is one of those songs thats kind of a staple for us","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"hey what s up spotify listeners this is tyler from twenty one pilots and i m gonna do a track by track commentary for our new album called vessel the first track is called ode to sleep and i remember back when i was first trying to name the song we actually played it live first before it was named and this is back when we had kind of a small following in our hometown and it was small enough that everyone got to write on a piece of paper and put into a bucket it which name they wanted the song to be named one was ode to sleep i forgeti honestly forget the other names of the songs but it was cool because a hometown audience got to name the song i like putting this song first on the album because it kinda puts the listener through kind of a song structure boot camp if you will when it comes to them being able to anticipate what the rest of the album is so ode to

and it s probably some of my favorite verses the content is something that i worked very hard on when it came to the lyrical side of it everything kind of came together i got the idea from i actually did have a headache the day that i was writing it for sure but then that wasnt really the point you know i was trying to make that a metaphoric thing where there s a lot going on in his head and what s really cool is that this is one of those songs that as a songwriter i like to kind of just emit some sort of message almost like a ripple in the water and when i feel that ripple bounce off of someone else who resonates with what it is im going through and it starts coming back at me it s just a really cool feeling of you know i m not alone in what i m going through so migraine is one those

which i actually have experience you know ive been in the mellow side of songwriting for a long time and i really enjoy it its just never felt like there was a place for it on this album other than towards the end of the cd it kind of shows my maturity as a songwriter you know when you have as many options as you want you know when i sit down at the keyboard i have any optioni can make the song do this i can turn it into this and a lot of times one of the first things that you learn as a songwriter and as a programmer is patience being able to just dial things back and dont throw too many things into the pot obviously you could look at the album and be like yeah you didnt do a good job of that you know im sorry but the song truce is cool cause its just me and the piano i remember when i was talking to my producer about what we wanted the piano to sound like he put it best he said you know i want the piano to sound kind of distant like its behind several layer of curtains or something and so we kind of got a sound that kinda a little bit eerie and not too in your face just to kinda give the vocals thatthe room to really say what it is that theyre trying to say and truce is one of those songs that i just wanted to tell people hang in there you know theres someone out there who does know what youre going through i know that theres a lot of bands that say they want to use music to help people and i know a lot of that might be full of crap but if someone is encouraged at all by the music that i write then my whole life will be justified so i mean i would be crazy

not a very hard instrument to learn and i just knew that you know i dont wanna be playing other peoples songs on this thing i wanna try to write a song which is how ive always approached instruments so i tried to write a song right away and started off very simple just strumming out that bottom string you know which is a c and i just kept it going and i was justand i kept doing that until i found the melody i was looking for and you know my mom is a big inspiration to me and so the song really talks about her and what it is that i wanna do for her and whether that be financially or just in

brand new idea brought to everybody from the recording process and this song the run and go i always put myself somewhere mentally you know when im writing a song with where do i wanna play this song and ive always pictured myself playing a song like that on a festival style show where obviously theres a ton of people and i dont know if youve picked up on it but i have a pretty crazy imagination and my dreams are pretty big but this is one of those songs where i picture myself playing in the middle of the day cause were not that big yet were not playing night time slots at festivals but thats

bloke routine by approaching gina s new boyfriend to say that he shouldn t feel that there s any animosity between us and then i even go and make peace with her shouldn t have bothered then on friday night we went through to the arches there was only one car going so some of us had to get the train we got through quite late then we went to a pub to take the gear there was no problems getting in we saw some others waiting down the front of the queue so we skipped in it was a good night everyone was nutted and i ended up dancing with some blonde girl i thought she had been quite pretty until last night when matthew informed me that she had in fact been a pig when the club finished we wandered the streets for a while until we got to this 24 hour cafe i didn t like the look of it so we left and got a taxi back to morag s flat i couldn t sleep so i sat about drinking someone else s strawberry tonic wine and tried to keep everyone else up then at ten o clock in the morning we went downstairs to buy some drink we had intended to watch the football in the afternoon but we d passed out by then and slept right through it awaking to find that england had won two nil then we went to get the train home and had a few in the station bar we had some stuff left from the previous night s supplies so when we got home we decided to go down to john s indie disco same story as friday lots of hugging lots of dancing etc etc i couldn t sleep again so went to the park to look at the toon taking a detour through the playpark to get in we had to climb over a ten foot steel fence which resulted in severe bruising of our hands legs and groins but we had a good laugh on the stuff especially the tube slide which probably doubles up as a urinal for drunk teens then we walked through the woods to have a look at the tomb big disappointment but the mist on the lake was cool sunday afternoon we go up to john s with a lot of beer in time to watch the simpsons it was a really good episode about love always ending in tragedy except of course for marge and homer it was quite moving at the end and to tell you the truth my eyes were a bit damp then we watched these young girls in swimsuits have a water fight in the street we went up to the pub about ten it was busy for a sunday night lots of people we know including my first ever girlfriend who i still find very attractive quite frankly but i didn t really speak to her she s probably still a bitch anyway her friend gillian was there i had a chat with her she was still quite pleasant at the same time i watched malcolm make some terrible attempt to try and chat up a girl we know called jo he made some remark about her skirt that was barely there the previous night or something i couldn t sleep again that night thanks to some seriously disturbing nightmares matthew says i should cut down on the cheese went out for the weekend it lasted for ever high with our friends it s officially summer went out for the weekend it lasted for ever

that cross that is more than her share rocking alone in an old rocking chair it wouldn t take much just to gladden her heart just some small remembrance on somebody s part a letter would brighten her empty life there rocking alone in an old rocking chair i look at her and i think what a shame the ones who forgot her she loves just the same and i think of angels as i see her there rocking alone in an old rocking chair","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"when you get a chance would you please call your mother and thank her for the good years that we had gently break the news that you don t love me and
