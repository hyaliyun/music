of the darkness kiss my face and then the devil woke up and he grabbed my throat he pulled me down to the place where the silence grows he looks at me with hollow eyes and he whispered my name as the

inside the doorways thunder went crashing as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds seemin to be the chimes of freedom flashing flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight

unexpectedly we watched with faces hidden as the walls were tightening as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin rain dissolved into the bells of the lightning tolling for the rebel tolling for the rake tolling for the luckless they abandoned and forsaked tolling for the outcast burning constantly at stake and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze leavin only bells of lightning and it s thunder striking for the gentle striking for the kind striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind and the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing and the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales for disrobed faceless forms of no position tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts all down in taken for granted situations tolling for the deaf and blind tolling for the mute for the mistreated mateless mother the mistitled prostitute for the misdemeanor outlaw chained and cheated by pursuit and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing even though a clouds white curtain in a far off corner flared and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail for the lonesome hearted lovers with too personal a tale and for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  starry eyed and laughing as i recall when we were caught trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended as we listened one last time and we watched with one last look spellbound and swallowed til the tolling ended tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed for the countless confused accused misused strung out ones and worse and for every hung up person in the whole wide universe and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin 1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m having a notion it s a strange the

tree is carbon where did that come from it comes from the air it s carbon dioxide from the air people look at trees and they think it comes out of the ground that plants grow out of the ground but if you ask where the substance comes from you find out where did it come from trees come out of the air they surely come out of the ground no they come out of the air no they come out of the air the carbon dioxide in the air goes into the tree and it changes it kicking out the oxygen and then pushing the oxygen away from the carbon and leaving the carbon substance with water water comes out of the ground only it came out of the air didn t it came down from the sky so most of it almost all of the tree is out of the ground i m sorry it s out of the air now of course i told you the oxygen and carbon stick together very tight how is it that the tree is so smart to manage to take the carbon dioxide which is the carbon oxygen nicely combined and undo that so easy ah life life has some mysterious quirks no the sun is shining and it s the sunlight that comes down and locks this oxygen away from the carbon so it takes sunlight to get the plant to work and so the sun all the time is doing the work of separating the oxygen away from the carbon the oxygen is some kind of terrible byproduct which it spits back into the air and leaving the carbon and water and stuff to make the substance of the tree and then when we take the substance in the tree and stick it in the fireplace it is the only oxygen made by these trees and all the carbon would much prefer to be close together again and once you ve let the heat to get it started it continues and makes an awful lot of activity while it s going back together again and all this nice light and everything comes out and everything is being undone you re going back to carbon and oxygen back to carbon dioxide and the light and the heat that s coming out that s the light and heat of the sun that went in the sun that went in so it s sort of stored sun that s coming out when you burn a log so it s sort of stored sun that s coming out when you burn a log  so it s sort of stored sun that s coming out when you burn a

came a tapping as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door tis some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore nameless here for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door this it is and nothing more presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door darkness there and nothing more deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my sour within me burning soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing more open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door perched and sat and nothing more then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on the night s plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door with such name as nevermore but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only that one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpour nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before then the bird said nevermore startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of never nevermore but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom s core this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining on the cushion s velvet lining that the lamp light gloated o er but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating o er she shall press ah nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor wretch i cried thy god hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted on this home by horror haunted tell me truly i implore is there is there balm in gilead tell me tell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven that bends above us by that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore be that our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting get thee back into the tempest and the night s plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming and the lamp light o er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i wanna rock and roll i wanna give my soul i m wanting to believe i m not too old don t wanna make it up don t wanna

necessary to stop ethnic cleansing and bring stability to eastern europe lead stories in the press reported in a televised address clinton explained that by bombing yugoslavia we are upholding our values protecting our interests and advancing the cause of peace in the preceding year according to western sources about 2 000 people had been killed in the yugoslav province of kosovo and there were several hundred thousand internal refugees the humanitarian catastrophe was overwhelmingly attributable to yugoslav military and police forces the main victims being ethnic albanian kosovars commonly said to constitute about 90 percent of the population after three days of bombing according to the un high commissioner for refugees several thousand refugees had been expelled to albania and macedonia the two neighboring countries refugees reported that the terror had reached the capital city of pristina largely spared before and provided credible accounts of large scale destruction of villages assassinations and a radical increase in generation of refugees perhaps an effort to expel a good part of the albanian population within two weeks the flood of refugees had reached some 350 000 mostly from the southern sections of kosovo adjoining macedonia and albania while unknown numbers of serbs fled north to serbia to escape the increased violence from the air and on the ground on march 27 u s nato commanding general wesley clark declared that it was entirely predictable that serbian terror and violence would intensify after the nato bombing on the same day state department spokesperson james rubin said that the united states is extremely alarmed by reports of an escalating pattern of serbian attacks on kosovar albanian civilians now attributed in large part to paramilitary forces mobilized after the bombing general clarks phrase entirely predictable is an overstatement nothing is entirely predictable surely not the effects of extreme violence but he is surely correct in implying that what happened at once was highly likely as observed by carnes lord of the fletcher school of law and diplomacy formerly a bush administration national security adviser enemies often react when shot at and though western officials continue to deny it there can be little doubt that the bombing campaign has provided both motive and opportunity for a wider and more savage serbian operation than what was first envisioned in the preceding months the threat of nato bombingagain predictablywas followed by an increase in atrocities the withdrawal of international observers sharply condemned by the serb parliament predictably had the same consequence the bombing was then undertaken under the rational expectation that killing and refugee generation would escalate as a result as indeed happened even if the scale may have come as a surprise to some though apparently not the commanding general under tito kosovars had had a considerable measure of self rule so matters remained until 1989 when kosovos autonomy was rescinded by slobodan milosevic who established direct serbian rule and imposed a serbian version of apartheid in the words of former u s government specialist on the balkans james hooper no dove he advocates direct nato invasion of kosovo the kosovars confounded the international community hooper continues by eschewing a war of national liberation embracing instead the nonviolent approach espoused by leading kosovo intellectual ibrahim rugova and constructing a parallel civil society an impressive achievement for which they were rewarded by polite audiences and rhetorical encouragement from western governments the nonviolent strategy lost its credibility at the dayton accords in november 1995 hooper observes at dayton the u s effectively partitioned bosnia herzegovina between an eventual greater croatia and greater serbia after having roughly equalized the balance of terror by providing arms and training for the forces of croatian dictator tudjman and supporting his violent expulsion of serbians from krajina and elsewhere with the sides more or less balanced and exhausted the u s took over displacing the europeans who had been assigned the dirty work much to their annoyance in deference to milosevic hooper writes the u s excluded kosovo albanian delegates from the dayton negotiations and avoided discussion of the kosovo problem the reward for nonviolence was international neglect more accurately u s neglect recognition that the u s understands only force led to the rise of the guerrilla kosovo liberation army and expansion of popular support for an armed independence struggle by february 1998 kla attacks against serbian police stations led to a serbian crackdown and retaliation against civilians another standard pattern israeli atrocities in lebanon particularly under nobel peace laureate shimon peres are or should be a familiar example though one that is not entirely appropriate these israeli atrocities are typically in response to attacks on its military forces occupying foreign territory in violation of longstanding security orders to withdraw many israeli attacks are not retaliatory at all including the 1982 invasion that devastated much of lebanon and left 20 000 civilians dead we need scarcely imagine how the u s would respond to attacks on police stations by a guerrilla force with foreign bases and supplies fighting in kosovo escalated the scale of atrocities corresponding roughly to the resources of violence an october 1998 cease fire made possible the deployment of 2 000 european monitors breakdown of u s milosevic negotiations led to renewed fighting which increased with the threat of nato bombing and the withdrawal of the monitors again as predicted officials of the un refugee agency and catholic relief services had warned that the threat of bombing would imperil the lives of tens of thousands of refugees believed to be hiding in the woods predicting tragic consequences if nato made it impossible for us to be here atrocities then sharply escalated as the late march bombing provided motive and opportunity as was surely predictable if not entirely so the bombing was undertaken under u s initiative after milosevic had refused to accept a u s ultimatum the rambouillet agreement of the nato powers in february there were disagreements within nato captured in a new york times headline that reads trickiest divides are among big powers at kosovo talks one problem had to do with deployment of nato peacekeepers the european powers wanted to ask the security council to authorize the deployment in accord with treaty obligations and international law washington however refused to allow the neuralgic word authorize the new york times reported though it did finally permit endorse the clinton administration was sticking to its stand that nato should be able to act independently of the united nations the discord within nato continued apart from britain nato countries were skeptical of washingtons preference for force and annoyed by secretary of state albrights saber rattling which they regarded as unhelpful when negotiations were at such a sensitive stage though u s officials were unapologetic about the hard line turning from generally uncontested fact to speculation we may ask why events proceeded as they did focusing on the decisions of u s plannersthe factor that must be our primary concern on elementary moral grounds and that is a leading if not decisive factor on grounds of equally elementary considerations of power we may note at first that the dismissal of kosovar democrats in deference to milosevic is hardly surprising to mention another example after saddam husseins repeated gassing of kurds in 1988 in deference to its friend and ally the u s barred official contacts with kurdish leaders and iraqi democratic dissidents who were largely excluded from the media as well the official ban was renewed immediately after the gulf war in march 1991 when saddam was tacitly authorized to conduct a massacre of rebelling shiites in the south and then kurds in the north the massacre proceeded under the steely gaze of stormin norman schwartzkopf who explained that he was suckered by saddam not anticipating that saddam might carry out military actions with the military helicopters he was authorized by washington to use the bush administration explained that support for saddam was necessary to preserve stability and its preference for a military dictatorship that would rule iraq with an iron fist just as saddam had done was sagely endorsed by respected u s commentators tacitly acknowledging past policy secretary of state albright announced in december 1998 that we have come to the determination that the iraqi people would benefit if they had a government that really represented them a few months earlier on may 20 albright had informed indonesian president suharto that he was no longer our kind of guy having lost control and disobeyed imf orders so that he must resign and provide for a democratic transition a few hours later suharto transferred formal authority to his hand picked vice president we now celebrate the may 1999 elections in indonesia hailed by washington and the press as the first democratic elections in 40 yearsbut without a reminder of the major u s clandestine military operation 40 years ago that brought indonesian democracy to an end undertaken in large measure because the democratic system was unacceptably open even allowing participation of the left we need not tarry on the plausibility of washingtons discovery of the merits of democracy in the past few months the fact that the words can be articulated eliciting no comment is informative enough in any event there is no reason to be surprised at the disdain for non violent democratic forces in kosovo or at the fact that the bombing was undertaken with the likely prospect that it would undermine a courageous and growing democratic movement in belgrade now probably demolished as serbs are unified from heavenbut by the bombs not by god in the words of aleksa djilas the historian son of yugoslav dissident milovan djilas the bombing has jeopardized the lives of more than 10 million people and set back the fledgling forces of democracy in kosovo and serbia having blasted germinating seeds and insured that they will not sprout again for a very long time according to serbian dissident veran matic editor in chief of the independent station radio b 92 former boston globe editor randolph ryan who has been working for years in the balkans and living in belgrade writes that now thanks to nato serbia has overnight become a totalitarian state in a frenzy of wartime mobilization as nato must have expected just as it had to know that milosevic would take immediate revenge by redoubling his attacks in kosovo which nato would have no way to stop as to what planners envisioned carnes lords confidence is hard to share if the documentary record of past actions is any guide planners probably were doing what comes naturally to those with a strong cardin this case violence namely play it and then see what happens with the basic facts in mind one may speculate about how washingtons decisions were made turbulence in the balkans qualifies as a humanitarian crisis in the technical sense it might harm the interests of rich and privileged people unlike slaughters in sierra leone or angola or crimes we support or conduct ourselves the question then is how to control the authentic crisis the u s will not tolerate the institutions of world order so the problems have to be handled by nato which the u s pretty much dominates the divisions within nato are understandable violence is washingtons strong card it is necessary to guarantee the credibility of natomeaning of u s violence others must have proper fear of the global hegemon one unappealing aspect of nearly any alternative to bombing barton gellman observed in a washington post review of the events that led to the confrontation in kosovo was the humiliation of nato and the united states national security adviser samuel berger listed among the principal purposes of bombing to demonstrate that nato is serious a european diplomat concurred inaction would have involved a major cost in credibility particularly at this time as we approach the nato summit in celebration of its fiftieth anniversary to walk away now would destroy natos credibility prime minister tony blair informed parliament blair is not concerned with the credibility of italy or belgium and understands credibility in the manner of any mafia don violence may fail but planners can be confident that there is always more in reserve side benefits include an escalation of arms production and salesthe cover for the massive state role in the high tech economy for years just as bombing unites serbs behind milosevic it unites americans behind our leaders these are standard effects of violence they may not last for long but planning is for the short term the issues there are two fundamental issues what are the accepted and applicable rules of world order how do these or other considerations apply in the case of kosovo there is a regime of international law and international order binding on all states based on the un charter and subsequent resolutions and world court decisions in brief the threat or use of force is banned unless explicitly authorized by the security council after it has determined that peaceful means have failed or in self defense against armed attack until the security council acts there is of course more to say thus there is at least a tension if not an outright contradiction between the rules of world order laid down in the un charter and the rights articulated in the universal declaration of human rights a second pillar of the world order established under u s initiative after world war ii the charter bans force violating state sovereignty the ud guarantees the rights of individuals against oppressive states the issue of humanitarian intervention arises from this tension it is the right of humanitarian intervention that is claimed by the u s nato in kosovo with the general support of editorial opinion and news reports the question was addressed at once in a new york times report headed legal scholars support case for using force one example is offered allen gerson former counsel to the u s mission to the un two other legal scholars are cited one ted galen carpenter scoffed at the administration argument and dismissed the alleged right of intervention the third is jack goldsmith a specialist on international law at chicago law school he says that critics of the nato bombing have a pretty good legal argument but many people think does exist as a matter of custom and practice that summarizes the evidence offered to justify the favored conclusion stated in the headline goldsmiths observation is reasonable at least if we agree that facts are relevant to the determination of custom and practice we may also bear in mind a truism the right of humanitarian intervention if it exists is premised on the good faith of those intervening and that assumption is based not on their rhetoric but on their record in particular their record of adherence to the principles of international law world court decisions and so on that is indeed a truism at least with regard to others consider for example iranian offers to intervene in bosnia to prevent massacres at a time when the west would not do so these were dismissed with ridicule if there was a reason beyond subordination to power it was because iranian good faith could not be assumed a rational person then asks obvious questions is the iranian record of intervention and terror worse than that of the u s and other questions for example how should we assess the good faith of the only country to have vetoed a security council resolution calling on all states to obey international law what about its historical record unless such questions are prominent on the agenda of discourse an honest person will dismiss it as mere allegiance to doctrine a useful exercise is to determine how much of the literaturemedia or othersurvives such elementary conditions as these when the decision was made to bomb there had been a serious humanitarian crisis in kosovo for a year in such cases outsiders have three choices try to escalate the catastrophe do nothing try to mitigate the catastrophe the choices are illustrated by other contemporary cases lets keep to a few of approximately the same scale and ask where kosovo fits into the pattern colombia in colombia according to state department estimates the annual level of political killing by the government and its paramilitary associates is about at the level of kosovo and refugee flight primarily from their atrocities is well over a million another 300 000 last year colombia has been the leading western hemisphere recipient of u s arms and training as violence increased through the 1990s and that assistance is now increasing under a drug war pretext dismissed by almost all serious observers the clinton administration was particularly enthusiastic in its praise for president gaviria whose tenure in office was responsible for appalling levels of violence according to human rights organizations even surpassing his predecessors details are readily available in this case the u s reaction is escalate the atrocities turkey for years turkish repression of kurds has been a major scandal it peaked in the 1990s one index is the flight of over a million kurds from the countryside to the unofficial kurdish capital diyarbakir from 1990 to 1994 as the turkish army was devastating the countryside two million were left homeless according to the turkish state minister for human rights a result of state terrorism in part he acknowledged mystery killings of kurds alone amounted to 3 200 in 1993 and 1994 along with torture destruction of thousands of villages bombing with napalm and an unknown number of casualties generally estimated in the tens of thousands no one was counting the killings are attributed to kurdish terror in turkish propaganda generally adopted in the u s as well presumably serbian propaganda follows the same practice 1994 marked two records in turkey it was the year of the worst repression in the kurdish provinces jonathan randal reported from the scene and the year when turkey became the biggest single importer of american military hardware and thus the worlds largest arms purchaser its arsenal 80 percent american included m 60 tanks f 16 fighter bombers cobra gunships and blackhawk slick helicopters all of which were eventually used against the kurds when human rights groups exposed turkeys use of u s jets to bomb villages the clinton adminis tration found ways to evade laws requiring suspension of arms deliveries much as it was doing in indonesia and elsewhere turkish aircraft have now shifted to bombing serbia while turkey is lauded for its humanitarianism colombia and turkey explain their atrocities on grounds that they are defending their countries from the threat of terrorist guerrillas as does the government of yugoslavia again the example illustrates act to escalate the atrocities laos every year thousands of people mostly children and poor farmers are killed in the plain of jars in northern laos the scene of the heaviest bombing of civilian targets in history it appears and arguably the most cruel washingtons furious assault on a poor peasant society had little to do with its wars in the region the worst period was from 1968 when washington was compelled to undertake negotiations ending the regular bombardment of north vietnam kissinger nixon then shifted the planes to bombardment of laos and cambodia the deaths are from bombies tiny anti personnel weapons far worse than land mines they are designed specifically to kill and maim and have no effect on trucks buildings etc the plain was saturated with hundreds of millions of these criminal devices which have a failure to explode rate of 20 percent to 30 percent according to the manufacturer honeywell the numbers suggest either remarkably poor quality control or a rational policy of murdering civilians by delayed action these were only a fraction of the technology deployed including advanced missiles to penetrate caves where families sought shelter current annual casualties from bombies are estimated from hundreds a year to an annual nationwide casualty rate of 20 000 more than half of them deaths according to the veteran asia reporter barry wain of the wall street journal in its asia edition a conservative estimate then is that the crisis last year was approximately comparable to kosovo though deaths are far more highly concentrated among children over half according to studies reported by the mennonite central committee which has been working there since 1977 to alleviate the continuing atrocities there have been efforts to publicize and deal with the humanitarian catastrophe a british based mine advisory group is trying to remove the lethal objects but the u s is conspicuously missing from the handful of western organisations that have followed mag the british press reports though it has finally agreed to train some laotian civilians the british press also reports with some annoyance the allegation of mag specialists that the u s refuses to provide them with render harmless procedures that would make their work a lot quicker and a lot safer these remain a state secret as does the whole affair in the united states the bangkok press reports a very similar situation in cambodia particularly the eastern region where u s bombardment from early 1969 was most intense in this case the u s reaction is do nothing the reaction of the media and commentators is to keep silent following the norms under which the war against laos was designated a secret war meaning well known but suppressed as also in the case of cambodia from march 1969 the level of self censorship was extraordinary then as is the current phase the relevance of this shocking example should be obvious without further comment president clinton explained to the nation that there are times when looking away simply is not an option we cant respond to every tragedy in every corner of the world but that doesnt mean that we should do nothing for no one but the president and commentators failed to add that the times are well defined the principle applies to humanitarian crises in the technical sense discussed earlier when the interests of rich and privileged people are endangered accordingly the examples just mentioned do not qualify as humanitarian crises so looking away and not responding are definitely options if not obligatory on similar grounds clintons policies on africa are understood by western diplomats to be leaving africa to solve its own crises for example in the republic of congo scene of a major war and huge atrocities here clinton refused a un request for a trivial sum for a battalion of peacekeepers according to the uns senior africa envoy the highly respected diplomat mohamed sahnoun a refusal that torpedoed the un proposal in the case of sierra leone washington dragged out discussions on a british proposal to deploy peacekeepers in 1997 paving the way for another major disaster but also of the kind for which looking away is the preferred option in other cases too the united states has actively thwarted efforts by the united nations to take on peacekeeping operations that might have prevented some of africas wars according to european and un diplomats correspondent colum lynch reported as the plans to bomb serbia were reaching their final stages i will skip other examples of and which abound and also contemporary atrocities of a different kind such as the slaughter of iraqi civilians by means of a vicious form of what amounts to biological warfare a very hard choice madeleine albright commented on national tv in 1996 when asked for her reaction to the killing of half a million iraqi children in five years but we think the price is worth it current estimates remain about 5 000 children killed a month and the price is still worth it these and other examples might be kept in mind when we read admiring accounts of how the moral compass of the clinton administration is at last functioning properly in kosovo kosovo is another illustration of act in such a way as to escalate the violence with exactly that expectation to find examples illustrating is all too easy at least if we keep to official rhetoric the most extensive recent academic study of humanitarian intervention is by george washington university law professor sean murphy he reviews the record after the kellogg briand pact of 1928 which outlawed war and then after the un charter which strengthened and articulated these provisions in the first phase he writes the most prominent examples of humanitarian intervention were japans attack on manchuria mussolinis invasion of ethiopia and hitlers occupation of parts of czechoslovakia all accompanied by uplifting humanitarian rhetoric and factual justifications as well japan was going to establish an earthly paradise as it defended manchurians from chinese bandits with the support of a leading chinese nationalist a far more credible figure than anyone the u s was able to conjure up during its attack on south vietnam mussolini was liberating thousands of slaves as he carried forth the western civilizing mission hitler announced germanys intention to end ethnic tensions and violence and safeguard the national individuality of the german and czech peoples in an operation filled with earnest desire to serve the true interests of the peoples dwelling in the area in accordance with their will the slovakian president asked hitler to declare slovakia a protectorate another useful intellectual exercise is to compare those obscene justifications with those offered for interventions including humanitarian interventions in the post un charter period in that period perhaps the most compelling example of is the vietnamese invasion of cambodia in december 1978 terminating pol pots atrocities which were then peaking vietnam pleaded the right of self defense against armed attack one of the few post charter examples when the plea is plausible the khmer rouge regime was carrying out murderous attacks against vietnam in border areas the u s reaction is instructive the press condemned the prussians of asia for their outrageous violation of international law they were harshly punished for the crime of having ended pol pots slaughters first by a chinese invasion then by u s imposition of extremely harsh sanctions the u s recognized the expelled dk as the official government of cambodia because of its continuity with the pol pot regime the state department explained not too subtly the u s supported the khmer rouge in its continuing attacks in cambodia the example tells us more about the custom and practice that underlies the emerging legal norms of humanitarian intervention another illustration of is indias invasion of east pakistan in 1971 which terminated an enormous massacre and refugee flight the u s condemned india for aggression kissinger was particularly infuriated by indias action in part it seems because it was interfering with a carefully staged secret trip to china perhaps this is one of the examples that historian john lewis gaddis had in mind in his fawning review of the latest volume of kissingers memoirs when he reports admiringly that kissinger acknowledges here more clearly than in the past the influence of his upbringing in nazi germany the examples set by his parents and the consequent impossibility for him of operating outside a moral framework the logic is overpowering as are the illustrations too well known to record again the same lessons despite the desperate efforts of ideologues to prove that circles are square there is no serious doubt that the nato bombings further undermine what remains of the fragile structure of international law the u s made that clear in the debates that led to the nato decision as already discussed today the more closely one approaches the conflicted region the greater the opposition to washingtons insistence on force even within nato again that is not an unusual phenomenon another current example is the u s uk bombing of iraq undertaken in december with unusually brazen gestures of contempt for the security council even the timing coinciding with an emergency session to deal with the crisis still another illustration minor in context is the destruction of half the pharmaceutical production of a small african country a few months earlier another event that does not indicate that the moral compass is straying from righteousness though comparable destruction of u s facilities by islamic terrorists might evoke a slightly different reaction it is unnecessary to emphasize that there is a far more extensive record that would be prominently reviewed right now if facts were considered relevant to determining custom and practice it could be argued rather plausibly that further demolition of the rules of world order is by now of no significance as in the late 1930s the contempt of the worlds leading power for the framework of world order has become so extreme that there is little left to discuss a review of the internal documentary record demonstrates that the stance traces back to the earliest days even to the first memorandum of the newly formed national security council in 1947 during the kennedy years the stance began to gain overt expression as for example when the highly respected statesperson and kennedy adviser dean acheson justified the blockade of cuba in 1962 by informing the american society for international law that a situation in which our countrys power position and prestige are involved cannot be treated as a legal issue the main innovation of the reagan clinton years is that defiance of international law and solemn obligations has become entirely open it has also been backed with interesting explanations which would be on the front pages and prominent in the school and university curriculum if honesty and human consequences were considered significant values the highest authorities explained that international law and agencies had become irrelevant because they no longer follow u s orders as they did in the early postwar years when u s power was overwhelming when the world court was considering what it later condemned as washingtons unlawful use of force against nicaragua secretary of state george shultz derided those who advocate utopian legalistic means like outside mediation the united nations and the world court while ignoring the power element of the equation clear and forthright and by no means original state department legal adviser abraham sofaer explained that members of the un can no longer be counted on to share our view and the majority often opposes the united states on important international questions so we must reserve to ourselves the power to determine how we will act one can follow standard practice and ignore custom and practice or dismiss it on some absurd grounds or we can take custom practice and explicit doctrine seriously departing from respectable norms but at least opening the possibility of understanding what is happening in the world while the reaganites broke new ground under clinton the defiance of world order has become so extreme as to be of concern even to hawkish policy analysts in the current issue of the leading establishment journal foreign affairs samuel huntington warns that washington is treading a dangerous course in the eyes of much of the world probably most of the world he suggests the u s is becoming the rogue superpower considered the single greatest external threat to their societies realist international relations theory he argues predicts that coalitions may arise to counterbalance the rogue superpower on pragmatic grounds then the stance should be reconsidered americans who prefer a different image of their society might have other grounds for concern over these tendencies but they are probably of little concern to planners with their narrower focus and immersion in ideology where does that leave the question of what to do in kosovo it leaves it unanswered the u s has chosen a course of action which as it explicitly recognizes escalates atrocities and violence a course that strikes yet another blow against the regime of international order which does offer the weak at least some limited protection from predatory states a course that undermines perhaps destroys promising democratic developments within yugoslavia probably macedonia as well as for the longer term consequences are unpredictable one plausible observation is that every bomb that falls on serbia and every ethnic killing in kosovo suggests that it will scarcely be possible for serbs and albanians to live beside each other in some sort of peace other possible long term outcomes are not pleasant to contemplate the resort to violence has again predictably narrowed the options perhaps the least ugly that remains is an eventual partition of kosovo with serbia taking the northern areas that are rich in resources and have the main historical monuments and the southern sector becoming a nato protectorate where some albanians can live in misery another possibility is that with much of the population gone the u s might turn to the carthaginian solution if that happens it would again be nothing new as large areas of indochina can testify a standard argument is that we had to do something we could not simply stand by as atrocities continue the argument is so absurd that it is rather surprising to hear it voiced suppose you see a crime in the streets and feel that you cant just stand by silently so you pick up an assault rifle and kill everyone involved criminal victim bystanders are we to understand that to be the rational and moral response one choice always available is to follow the hippocratic principle first do no harm if you can think of no way to adhere to that elementary principle then do nothing at least that is preferable to causing harm but there are always other ways that can be considered diplomacy and negotiations are never at an end that was true right before the bombing when the serb parliament responding to clintons ultimatum called for negotiations over an international presence in kosovo immediately after the signing of an accord for self administration in kosovo which will be accepted by all national communities living in the province reported on wire services worldwide but scarcely noted here just what that meant we cannot know since the two warrior states preferred to reject the diplomatic path in favor of violence another argument if one can call it that has been advanced most prominently by henry kissinger he believes that intervention was a mistake that aside it is futile through the centuries these conflicts have been fought with unparalleled ferocity because none of the populations has any experience with and essentially no belief in western concepts of toleration at last we understand why europeans have treated each other with such gentle solicitude through the centuries and have tried so hard over many centuries to bring to others their message of non violence toleration and loving kindness one can always count on kissinger for some comic relief though in reality he is not alone he is joined by those who ponder balkan logic as contrasted with the western record of humane rationality and those who remind us of the distaste for war or for intervention in the affairs of others that is our inherent weakness of our dismay over the repeated violations of norms and rules established by international treaty human rights conventions we are to consider kosovo as a new collision of east and west a times think piece is headlined a clear illustration of samuel huntingtons clash of civilizations a democratic west its humanitarian instincts repelled by the barbarous inhumanity of orthodox serbs all of this clear to americans but not to others a fact that americans fail to comprehend or we may listen to the inspiring words of secretary of defense william cohen introducing the president at norfolk naval air station he opened by quoting theodore roosevelt speaking at the dawn of this century as america was awakening into its new place in the world president roosevelt said unless youre willing to fight for great ideals those ideals will vanish and today at the dawn of the next century were joined by president bill clinton who understands as well as teddy roose velt that standing on the sidelines as a witness to the unspeakable horror that was about to take place that would in fact affect the peace and stability of nato countries was simply unacceptable one has to wonder what must pass through the mind of someone invoking this famous racist fanatic and raving jingoist as a model of american values along with the events that illustrated his cherished great ideals as he spoke the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of filipinos who had sought liberation from spain shortly after roosevelts contribution to preventing cubans from achieving the same goal wiser commentators will wait until washington settles on an official story after two weeks of bombing the story is that they both knew and didnt know that a catastrophe would follow on march 28 when a reporter asked if the bombing was accelerating the atrocities replied absolutely not he reiterated that stand in his april 1 speech at norfolk had we not acted the serbian offensive would have been carried out with impunity the following day pentagon spokesperson kenneth bacon announced that the opposite was true i dont think anyone could have foreseen the breadth of this brutality the first acknowledgment by the administration that it was not fully prepared for the crisis the press reported a crisis that was entirely predictable the command ing general had informed the press a week earlier from the start reports from the scene were that the administration had been caught off guard by the serbian military reaction the right of humanitarian intervention is likely to be more frequently invoked in coming years maybe with justification maybe not now that cold war pretexts have lost their efficacy in such an era it may be worthwhile to pay attention to the views of highly respected commentatorsnot to speak of the world court which ruled on the matter of intervention and humanitarian aid in a decision rejected by the united states its essentials not even reported in the scholarly disciplines of international affairs and international law it would be hard to find more respected voices than hedley bull or louis henkin bull warned 15 years ago that particular states or groups of states that set themselves up as the authoritative judges of the world common good in disregard of the views of others are in fact a menace to international order and thus to effective action in this field henkin in a standard work on world order writes that the pressures eroding the prohibition on the use of force are deplorable and the arguments to legitimize the use of force in those circumstances are unpersuasive and dangerous violations of human rights are indeed all too common and if it were permissible to remedy them by external use of force there would be no law to forbid the use of force by almost any state against almost any other human rights i believe will have to be vindicated and other injustices remedied by other peaceful means not by opening the door to aggression and destroying the principal advance in international law the outlawing of war and the prohibition of force recognized principles of international law and world order treaty obligations decisions by the world court considered pronouncements by the most respected commentators these do not automatically yield solutions to particular problems each has to be considered on its merits for those who do not adopt the standards of saddam hussein there is a heavy burden of proof to meet in undertaking the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international order perhaps the burden can be met but that has to be shown not merely proclaimed with passionate rhetoric the consequences of such violations have to be assessed carefullyin particular what we take to be predictable for those who are minimally serious the reasons for the actions also have to be assessed on rational grounds with attention to historical fact and the documentary record not simply by adulation of our leaders and their moral compass","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there was a look in your eye or was it my reflection tell me you
