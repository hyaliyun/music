horns of a new moonlight caesars ghost i saw the wartime tides the prince of denmarks father still and quiet the whole world was looking to get drowned trees were a fist shaking themselves at the clouds i looked over curtains oh it s then that i knew that only a full house gonna make it through i became a thin blue wire that held the world above the fire so it was i saw behind heavens just a thin blue line if gods up there hes in a cold dark room the heavenly host are just the cold dark moons he bent down and made the world in seven days and ever since hes been a walking away mixing with nitrogen in lonely holes where neither seraphim or raindrops go i see an old man wandering the halls alone but only a full house gonna make a home and i became a thin blue stream the smoke between asleep and dreams and in that clear blue undertow saw royal city far below borders soft with refugees streets a swimming with amputees its a bible or a bullet they put over your heart its getting harder and harder to tell them apart the days are nights and the nights are long beating hearts blossom into walking bombs and those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign get missiles from so high they might as well be divine and now the dogs are howling at your door singing about vengeance like its the joy of the lord bringing justice to the enemies not the other way round theyre guilty where killed and theyre killed where theyre found if whats loosed on earth will be loosed up on high its a hell of a heaven we must go to when we die where even laurel begs hardy for vengeance please the fat man s crying on his hands and his knees back in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage now he twists indecision takes bourbon for rage lead pellets peppering aluminum halcyon laudanum and opium he sings kiss thee hardy this poisoned cup his winding sheet is busy winding up in darkness he looks for the lights that have died you need faith for the same reasons that its so hard to find and this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck and like good tragedy thats what we expect at night i make plans for a city laid down like the hips of a girl on the spring covered ground spirals and capitals and the twists of a script streets named for heroes that could almost exist fruit trees from eden and the gardens that seem to float like the smoke from a lithium dream cedar trees growing in the cool of the squares young women walking in the portals of prayer the future glass buildings and the past an address the weddings in pollen and the wine bottomless and all wrongs forgotten and all vengeance made right the suffering verbs put to sleep in the night the future descending like a bright chandelier the world just beginning and the guests in good cheer in royal city i fell into a trance cause its hell to believe there aint a hell of a chance i woke beneath a clear blue sky the sun a shout the breeze a sigh the old hometown and the streets i knew wrapped up in a royal blue i heard my friends laughing out across the fields girls in the gloaming and the birds on the wheel the raw smell of horses and the warm smell of hay cicadas electric in the heat of the day a run of three sisters and the flush of the land and the lake was a diamond in the valleys hand the straight of the highway and the scattered out hearts they were coming together they were pulling apart and angels everywhere were in my midst in the ones that i loved in the ones that i kissed i wondered what it was id been looking for above heaven s so big there aint no need to look up so i

pluggin they super sport first they get behind my ride then they switch lanes to the left side i m scopin out the one smokin indo comin up fast rollin down his window he threw up a sign i put away my nine fool cause i m colorblind killer cali the state where they kill over colors cause brothers don t know the deal and they ll cap you not if they have to but if they want to first they might confront you but every nigga on my block can t stop and he won t stop and he don t stop not to the bang bang boogie but they like to gangbang and rookies ain t the only ones that drop some say the

here now picture that but on a black and white photograph cause brothers you don t know the half on the streets i was damn near out of my mind but ever since i ve been down i m colorblind  now here s the game plan yo at a quarter to nine i was told to peel a cap on the other side yo young and dumb and full of cum im a baby loc i gotta put in work for the hood and that ain t no joke stable and able but i m not ready and willin cause i m only thirteen and i ain t never did a killin grabbed the ak and jumped in the g ride started up the bucket and headed for the other side yo spotted the enemies

babies up in the dumpster but when i found out he came was perfect from a babe counting equality with god nothing to be attained he was living to save forgiving our shame though we was deserving to blame he preferred to give grace but they still put him in chains battered beaten and slain robes tattered and stained then he was thrown in the grave then he rose in three days god it s a good morning cause the son has been raised and as the tears run down my face and fall to my feet i heard a man crying out in the street talking bout you and me there he goes a hero the savior to the world here he stands with scars in his hands with love he gave his life so we could be free the savior of the world there will be no mourning there will be no crying he wipes every tear and stops us all from dying from every tribe and every nation and every climate a beautiful tapestry with god as the designer until i see his face amazing grace is my reminder this is the power of the cross though we re lost he can find us he s the good shepherd the priest the cornerstone the greatest servant and the king sitting on the throne if i was told i could save every person on the globe by giving up my son i d tell em no but it pleased the father to crush him he gave himself up with no discussion now we all stand blood covered redeemed us he cleaned us purchased and then freed us all this work but lord you don t need us you saved me so i don t want nothing if it s not in you your led your son to the cross help me follow suit lecrae there he goes a hero the savior to the world here he stands

pointed heads the object of the game was to toss a triangle as far as you could and then run to the opposite end of the field and catch it on the point of your head but since oblio had no point he would throw a triangle and arrow would jump up on his shoulders and the two of them would run to the opposite end of the field arrow making the catch using the point on the top of his head now most of the kids in the town thought it was alright for oblio and arrow to compete as a team but there was this one kid who was the son of the evil count who was the aid to the king and the counts kid insisted that cos triangle toss is a game for people with pointed heads and oblio obviously didn t fall into that category he should not be allowed to play well to settle the dispute they decided to have a contest best two out of three tosses and catches if oblio won he get to play if the counts kid won oblio wouldn t be allowed to play and that brings us to the game","artist_name":"Harry

holding you i feel like a mountain that doesnt know its being climbed as your breath is timed with the in and out of mine i rub my hand up your spine like it was the center line of a highway with no stop signs hit the intersection where your shoulders meet your neck and past the car wrecks of past boyfriends who parallel parked on dead ends and i just hope your skin lends me an extra mile so i can slow down take a while to admire the landscape and drape my arm over your being there this time when it comes to your skin im a drunk driver just trying to walk a straight line and some days collapse on me like the nights and i can tell i havent slept when the light peeks through the blinds and finds me with my eyes wide open hoping i can take all these poems i printed on post it notes fold them into tiny boats then launch them towards the shores of your skin where they can begin to colonize take up roots in your eyes weigh anchor in the harbor of your thighs until the tiny hairs on your body begin to rise like a million flags brought to mass and at long last i no longer have to roam and i finally understand those sailors who plant their lips to the ground i do the same to your body its because you taste like home and what i said was ill miss you what i meant to say was that i love you what i wanted to say was that i meant what i said i miss you like i miss my own bed after too many nights of sleeping on couches or hardwood floors or sitting silently behind the doors of hotel rooms became wounds breathing life in to this loneliness i miss you like a burn victim must miss

it s just that in most cases you could hold up a dress and a sweater then ask us which one is better we will always say naked that morning i slid out from behind the joke take a coat i said it was freezing that morning and the ice storm warning gave me cause to be concerned about your safety i still find it funny how when i love you can be reduced to a weather report i sort through the memories of that day and i m comforted by the fact that you used to say affection is in the details so i said wear that tuk the one that doesn t fit you quite right the one that makes you look like beauty is something you can put aside for a moment that lasts just long enough it lets you handcuff your makeup to the bathroom mirror let you leave your eyeshadow behind let you find your way back to me

ones you thought were red even though they were actually orange it s just that you were colorblind and i didn t have the heart to remind you because they were your favorite i loved the fact that on most days you looked like a patchwork quilt guilt free and warm you looked like an authority on all things lovely and i ve always had a thing for a girl in uniform that winter you left me snow blind trying to find enough details that would let you know that even though some people have perfect sight those same people could try to paint you by numbers and they still wouldn t get you right you were monet number 2 and van gogh number 6 a mixtape of hendrix and leibowitz portraits it makes no sense to me that we were ever together and my makeshift weather reports were the closest i ever came to telling you how i felt but you were a lover of the miniscule you dealt best with details weighing our relationship on scales you balanced us out and always made me feel needed you always asked me what

can catch it wrinkling in the rain see i can talk a good game from the stage but if you want to gage a romantic thing said when we were messing up the bed the best i can give you is oh my god we re totally humping regardless there s something beautiful about stating the obvious all of us do it in the moments when we can t believe it we have to say it it s like pinching yourself to make sure you re awake take for example something as simple as touching someone we so often say you re so soft and the last person to touch them may have said it for the twenty eighth time but today i m number twenty nine and i m not saying it for her benefit i m saying it for mine because there s almost 7 billion people in the world half of which are men and when the number of them is 3 5 billion it s pretty fuckin cool that i was number twenty nine and once upon a time i was first in line for a girl with freckles and strawberry blonde hair we loved like an electric chair hooked up to a nuclear power plant and plugged into the sun and everything we did had never been done i woke up the next morning with a smile that told the world i m number one i think of her more often than sometimes and if she ever hears this i want her to know that our first kiss tasted like pepper i met her on june 27th that year it was yellowknife s first day of continual light and despite the sun not setting that night we each went home alone even though our parents told us be home before dark we could ve stayed out for weeks could ve watched the way the sun leaks like liquid over the horizon casting shadows over all the right places of a bargain bin where love was 75 off and we were collectively 25 away from forever there are times in the north when the sun never sets and it gets confusing when we ask ourselves questions like is it too late or too early more often than sometimes we didn t care we lived like two games of solitaire waiting to be played by one another her mother once asked me do you love her and i said if there were 1 million teachers breathing down my neck telling me that the answer is no i would say yes i guess that was enough for her because that girl s father palmed me a condom and wished me a happy birthday even now there s no way to tell was that awkward or creepy we loved like two hit men hellbent on assassinating regret her orgasm was a wet gremlin multiplying itself into another her younger brother knocked on the bedroom door asking what are you guys doing in there and somewhere amid the awesome and all of the in between we replied in unison studying and we were i wrote notes on her skin in flesh toned permanent ink that would sink and sit inside as i tried to underline the important parts of her bellybutton birthmark collarbone and i wrote notes explaining that hers felt like silk stretched over stone i told her you re so soft she smiled and said duh followed by my bellybutton is not an erogenous zone and i said i hate that word and she asked which one and i said erogenous i told her there s beauty in the obvious and your bellybutton is where you started it s where cells divided and grew into you so let me do what students do best you can test me later but right now let me study she said you re lucky this is a take home test boy i highlighted and double underlined lips i think of the beauty in the obvious the way it forces us to admit how it exists the way it insists on being pointed out like a bloody nose or how every time it snows there is always someone around to say it s snowing but the obvious isn t showing off it s only reminding us that time passes and that somewhere along the way we grow up not perfect but up and out it teaches us something about time that we are all ticking and tocking walking the fine line between days and weeks as if each second speaks of years and each month has years listening to forever but never hearing anything beyond centuries swallowed up by millenniums as if time was calculating the sums needed to fill the empty belly of eternity we so seldom understand each other but if understanding is neither here nor there and the universe is infinite then understand that no matter where we go we will always be smack dab in the middle of nowhere all we can do is share some piece of ourselves and hope that it s remembered hope that we meant something to someone my chest is a cannon that i have used to take aim and shoot my heart upon this world i love the way an uncurled fist becomes a hand again because when i take notes i need it to underline the important parts of you happy sad lovely battle cry ballistic like a disaster or a lipstick earthquaking and taking out the monuments of all my hollow yesterdays we ll always have the obvious it reminds us who and where we are it lives like a heart shape like a jar that we hand to others and ask can you open this for me we always get the same answer not without breaking it more often than sometimes i say go for it","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the failing use of my right hand isn t actually the failing use of my right hand it s just another way to tell the time and i m ticking so i ve been picking myself up at bars with a bottle in each hand i only make plans with myself for the day after next but by the time the sun swings back around into position i forget the context of why i asked myself out in the first place did i think i was going to score i let a stranger pour me one more she says my name is sara doesn t take much more than that to start a relationship my darling sara cleans rooms for a living giving her youth and beauty to dirt and dust understands more than most that family must be the foot you put forward first you must weather the worst together but having never met her family she places love above all else then protests that i use the word love too freely in poems and i should really just say what i mean and i suppose what i mean most is that i m trying she s been buying me time on a maxed out credit card arms scarred from selling her own blood to pay down the debt tells me she doesn t mind going broke just so long as i can giver her a little swear she says try so i do my best impression of a pen and when every problem looks like a page i commit ink to paper the worth of the words that come out determines my wage i ve been making enough to pay her the compliment of not quitting of not sitting when standing is required she only asks that i put the effort n and in return she s willing to pin a paper heart to her chest then do her best impression of a target she tells me that effort is the siamese twin of success so when everyone else looks like a wrong answer she says she ll settle for being my best guess so we lie in bed like a mess that someone s been meaning to clean for the large part of a long while we lie there like a pile of dirty laundry and how we ll ever come clean is beyond me so we don t she says it s supposed to be dirty and if by the end you haven t hurt me then you didn t try so i do my best impression of a surgeon cutting purple hearts out of my own use my veins like thread then have hurt sewn to our skin like medals because when the bleeding stops and that dust settles all we have are our wounds to wear like decorations upon our chest sara does her best impression of a war tells me not to count my pride among casualties because maybe faith means never keeping score she says there s more to effort than just switching gears and in terms of what one should give in life sweat holds more value than tears you have to try and even though the failing use of my right hand means i ll never land a knockout punch in the first round life is composed of sound and fury whatever noise is left in me will be twice as loud when i try so i plug myself into the idea of going the distance and i amplify my darling sara has a throat like a vase she sings her words into bloom has voice like perfume it s been sticking to my clothes so everyone knows where i ve been sleeping she s been keeping me so close you could use my body for evidence pull her fingerprints as proof that she s been on top so often she s starting to look like my roof but a real sexy roof and she doesn t leak unless you count the crying she does that sometimes worries that she s just a back up plan my darling sara i ve lived long enough to learn too many choices can destroy a man i will make no exodus i ll be around long enough to watch uncertainty bid us farewell the echo our names into the crater caused by the impact of when our lack of conviction fell you ve never had to sell me on the idea of absolute certainty in the trustworthiness of another the first and only time you met my mother mom said i like the way she looks at you and i echoed back to her that i liked it too eyes like recycle bin blue sara looks at broken things as if she can make them new more than a few times i ve caught her staring caught her wearing a smile reserved for those busy making plans sara believes that distance is a fundamental that can be side stepped by a piece of string and two tin cans and i remember when my tin can rang they said there s no family to speak of so love is next in line and there s not a lot of time but she s asking for her boyfriend in the cab to the hospital i feel my heart bend as if bracing for impact so i do my best impression of a man and face fact it s supposed to hurt a doctor does his best impression of the truth and spares me his attempts to skirt around the issue they can t stop the bleeding and the failing use of sara s

and a fair few other giants of black american music perhaps because he was never as easy to pin down the compilers have until now opted to skirt around the genius of curtis mayfield the simple fact remains that he is one of the few genuine innovators of modern soul music as one of the most obvious bridges between r b and funk as a writer who brought a new dimension to the ghetto love song and as someone who was down with the cause from the dawn of civil rights in terms of sheer impact across a 20 year period there aren t many who can stand next to him happily people get ready turns out to be one of the smartest box sets ever put together and not just because it s got the words curtis and mayfield on the outside either but because it limits itself to a mere three cds which might sound a trifle tightfisted given that we re dealing with a back catalogue of some 30 odd albums but what it does is take you from the impressions in 1961 to take it to the streets released just before curtis mayfield s tragic accident 29 years later by way of the songs that represent the man at his absolute best the ones which painstakingly build layer upon layer of deceptively sumptuous strings bubbling percussion chopping guitar and sweeping brass topped off with a unique falsetto voice that could come over with equal facility as happy tearful urgent laid back celebratory or condemning the point is this while you won t get any argument from me that mayfield is one of the foremost poets of the 20th century or that his lush layered productions revolutionised the sound of black funk it s undeniable that he also cut quite a few wrong u ns along the way notably in the late 70s early 80s when soul was having a little identity crisis and he opted for disco remember love is the place you do then youre probably one of the five other people who bought it the sheer joy of people get ready is that it can extract the one track from love is the place which provides a musical flavour of the time while still sounding as much like a curtis song as say move on up namely she don t let nobody likewise the dreamy hustle style you are you are from do it all night or the crisp two step tripping out from something to believe and these messages are as crucial to the set as the impressions doo wop swinging gospel and deep roots r b or the fiery funk of the early 70s for tempting as it might be to cram the discs with the infinitely more credible and commercial aspects of curtis many of these later songs meant a great deal in certain circles as they kept clubland s soundtrack from going completely boogie oogie oogie so while party night may appear to have kept right on for the darkness out of the running it serves to present us with a fully rounded picture of one of the few individuals who has genuinely contributed to a number of different black music genres of course the major bonus of a shorter tracklisting is that it allows for fuller versions no radio edits or brutally truncated versions allowed here when a tune requires six minutes or more to make proper sense as in the case of billy jack get down or move on up then people get ready will let it flow which is what the whole set does with a particular sense of purpose the join from one stage of mayfield s career to the next is all but seamless first it flows around a snapshot of the impressions then it eases through the revolutionary material of the early 70s oozes round the weirdness of sweet exorcist and the skewed logic of there s no place like america today and into the disco period picking numbers that bring a dignity to the notion of the flared suit the set even goes as far as to include a cut from short eyes the soundtrack from a movie about a child molester in prison that disappeared almost immediately after its 1977 us only release indeed the only hiccough comes when curtis as a solo artist takes over from the impressions the first track we get is the makings of you with if there s a hell below we re all going to go following on its heels the latter track was the first track on side one of curtis his first solo album and the idea was that he announced himself and his new career with the booming lines niggers whiteys jews don t worry if there s hell below we re all gonna go it s a pity the same powerful statement couldn t have been made at the corresponding point here

story went you see first it was a dream i was living in rome and then i moved to london bought a brand new home and everywhere i went i drew lots of attention like a stretch limousine one of those new inventions it took a few years fore the day had come but i was ruler of the world ranked 1 so i headed towards washington to claim the crown let the whole world know that the king was in town as i arrived the crowd started to cheer and then someone yelled out the king is here so i headed toward stage to make a speech about the new style of living i was gonna teach uh huh if i ruled the world i d love all the girls wear diamonds and pearls if i ruled the world people started flowing as they reached for my hand i said thank you for bringing me to the promised land but now i must go so goodbye to everybody tonight i ll see you all at my super dinner party and late that night at my super dinner party i was dancing to the beat and entertaining la di da di the music started ending it was time for a speech the crowd started sitting as i rose from my feet and this was once a dream i explained to the crowd but now i rule the world and i feel so very proud excuse me please for stopping this show i just had to thank you all huh and me so my first day in office the king on the throne i spent my first three hours on the telephone you know with newsmen reporters and voters too i had so many calls i didn t know what to do you know hours passed i continued to work i signed so many papers my fingers started to hurt then i shook off the pain say this ain t no thing cause there s nothing in

night long and it s a song about love and happiness in a world of peace and you know that s fresh now i m the king and i want you to know that i m the master blaster rapper who s running the show and to all of you rappers in every country you better stop what you re doing and listen to me cause we gotta stop war and use unity to fight crime and hunger and poverty cause the african baby is dying overseas while you sucker mission politicians busting out z s huh 20 million people all unemployed while the rich man try to play pretty boy floyd while the working class just struggles hard try to make ends meet against all odds while the poor man can t even deal with life you know he tried to escape and smoked the coke on the pipe and it s time for a change to a better way cause the sun has gotta shine through the cloudy day so listen up world while i teach this class and take heed to the message or we ain t gonna last cause i know the solution is the contribution of woman and man to just join the revolution that ll take your brain to a higher plane and help you deal in a world that s gone insane with the problems that i know we can stop from the ruler of the world and the man on top but the years went by and time was up and then the ruler of the world had ran out of luck and all the people at the time who said they were my friends didn t know me when my job had come to an end

family that s as tight as you like i didn t really know where to start but college is kinda where the shit went pear see i found my wife in college but i never made it into the second year and i heard she was cheating and i was tryna figure it out like it was blue s clues but then you were friends with the guy she was beating i kinda felt like you let her get moved to cuz i felt snaked but i never said nothing never opened my mouth cause maybe you never knew you know you re my cousin you get the benefit of the doubt now imagine how gassed granddad would be seeing us on stage we were meant to be but it hasn t been an easy road man it s been like chapters on the first one s jealousy well maybe not jealousy but that word should give you an idea of the truth and true say we be first cousins when i say i do music yeah always comparing a kid like everywhere i go everybody saying something why don t he bring you in like a nigga did with yungen got me bunning got me feeling that the love is awful and they all say i should have been on paranormal now around that time i went from being cadet to krept s cousin and see yeah i was kicking myself cause i felt shit but never said nothing and like now we ain t spoken in months and even advice i can t ask the kid cause i remember your whatsapp status saying don t chat to me if you re going to ask for shit now around this time everything s getting loose feels like with me you want nothing to do see i m taking bare digs but everybody knew i was talking bout you in the like every single tune i was bruised even though i felt one way i would still

phone and phone you i m happy that you re doing your ting but it s a reminder of all the shit i don t do so when your videos were hitting a mill i was still taking bets up in william hill now jealousy gone cause it s dumb to feel and the second chapter is where the hunger spills see the second chapter s called hunger and this is where the shit gets peak cause it s when i stopped watching you and i started watching me but i still got your name in like every bar though parked up listening to argy fargo and the one time you brought me to wireless was exactly the kick i needed in the asshole cause you chose me right over the mandem like even though we haven t spoke in long though and wallahi after you send the invite thought you were going to say my bad wrong convo cause then you brought me on stage it was me you and killer konan i was the last one to come off stage well cause up there man it felt like home and i swear since that moment i took shit serious stopped shotting food quit the moves quit the fraud and mandem thought i was delirious see i d go carpark write bars leave the engine on and then somehow fall asleep wake up with a dead battery get jump started and then the same night go repeat till the point now that i ain t even got a car cause both the battery and engine s gone but at least now i m chasing my dream i ain t felt like a wasteman in long and the third chapter s called love ain t no soft shit ain t no need for boohoo s but when i started loving myself then i could love you like i used to got tired i been a wasteman rapper i m undercover in the crib man i got tired i go into music events didn t recognise me for a thing man i got tired i got tired of feeling like i ain t gonna win and yeah i got tired tired of telling you niggas that i don t know why you don t wanna bring a nigga in see i m just glad i m in the same race as you and the dream is to go and share 1st place with you you know man you re my left lung and there ain t no replacing you and
