to have to smile alone well it s been so long since my man s been gone and oh what a wonderful thing to have loved to have to die alone in selma s cards there re no folks fighting no tattered cloth on splayed out bones only the ottoman painted forests and only the quaint old homes but war stepped on our poor old door steps it s bloody boots on our welcome mat and madame selma started singing a low song about her man oh it s been so long since my man s been gone and if he s gone for the rest of my days will my love drag on well it s been so long since my man s been gone and it s been so long since the right kind of man tried to take me home and one day all the soldier s came by the joy they came beautiful young boys they came a marching the wheat fields waved their healthy hands the children ran their healthy hands reaching for their fathers hands and through the streets the music sings and through all the tears the music sings and all the years like nothing ever happened cheering well it s been so long since my man s been gone and it s been so long since the right kind of man tried to take me home madame selma keeps on smiling selling postcards in the square in all

here because you were there we ve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of america we were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the well being of the people it s only about profit everything elsetheir image their human resources their public relationsonly exist to protect the reality behind it once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart they didn t care about our survival or well beingthey just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources they took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own god and while some used missionaries and donations to off set this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions they supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them and stored them and kept them in power they became the bastard children of american industry kleptocracy governments of thievery they protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits the puppet rulers were given billions of us tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments and so the age of revolution began again they painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market but the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself it is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image destroy the image and the enemy will die such is the same in the rap industry but the major label super powers treat the underground like the third world when they need new assets new artists to prostitute a side ins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the third world they took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us but behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed they re no better than us their economic advertising was always a lie a few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the imf loans the seeds with suicide genes 20 year contracts and oil blood money build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters theyll stop at nothing to get what they want they paint the third world underground as savage and backward but the super powers are no less corrupt they ve just learned to disguise it better cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit and when there s enough at stake history s taught us that they ll even assassinate their own presidents just as the columbia represents man s highest

perhaps that his shoes were too tight it could be his head wasn t screwed on just right but i think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small but whatever the reason his heart or his shoes he stood there on christmas eve hating the whos staring down from his cave with a sour grinchy frown at the warm lighted windows below in their town for he knew every who down in whoville beneath was busy now hanging a hollywho wreath and they re hanging their stockings he snarled with a sneer tomorrow is christmas it s practically here then he growled with his grinch fingers nervously drumming i must find some way to keep christmas from coming for tomorrow i know all the who girls and boys will wake bright and early they ll rush for their toys and then oh the noise oh the noise noise noise noise there s one thing i hate all the noise noise noise noise they ll stand close together with christmas bells ringing they ll stand hand in hand and those whos will start singing fahoo forays dahoo dorays welcome christmas come this way fahoo forays dahoo dorays welcome christmas christmas day welcome welcome fahoo ramus welcome welcome dahoo damus christmas day is in our grasp so long as we have hands to clasp fahoo forays dahoo dorays and they ll sing and they ll sing and they ll sing sing sing sing and the more the grinch thought of this who christmas sing the more the grinch thought i must stop this whole thing why for fifty three years i ve put up with it now i must stop christmas from coming but how then he got an idea an awful idea the grinch got a wonderful awful idea i know just what to do the grinch laughed in his throat i ll make a quick santy claus hat and a coat this is stop number one the old grinchy claus hissed as he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist then he slid down the chimney a rather tight pinch but if santa could do it then so could the grinch he got stuck only once for a minute or two then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue where the little who stockings hung all in a row these stockings he grinched are the first things to go then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant around the whole room and he took every present it was quarter of dawn all the whos still a bed all the whos still a snooze when he packed up his sled packed it up with their presents their ribbons their wrappings their snoof and their fuzzles their tringlers and trappings ten thousand feet up up the side of mount crumpet he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it pooh pooh to the whos he was grinchily humming they re finding out now that no christmas is coming they re just waking up i know just what they ll do their mouths will hang open a minute or two then the whos down in whoville will all cry boo hoo that s a noise grinned the grinch that i simply must hear he paused and the grinch put a hand to his ear and he did hear a sound rising over the snow it started in low then it started to grow but this sound wasn t sad why this sound sounded glad every who down in whoville the tall and the small was singing without any presents at all he hadn t stopped christmas from coming it came somehow or other it came just the same and the grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow stood puzzling and puzzling how could it be so it came without ribbons it came without tags it came without packages boxes or bags he puzzled and puzzed till his puzzler was sore then the grinch thought of something he hadn t before maybe christmas he thought doesn t come from a store maybe christmas perhaps means a little bit more and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch s small heart grew three sizes that day and then the true meaning of christmas came through and the grinch found the strength of ten grinches plus two and now that his heart didn t feel quite so tight he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light with a smile to his soul he descended mount crumpet cheerily blowing who who on his trumpet he rode into whoville he brought back their toys he brought back their floof to the who girls and boys he brought back their snoof and their tringlers and fuzzles brought back their pantookas their dafflers and wuzzles he brought everything back all the food for the feast and he he himself the grinch carved the roast beast welcome christmas bring your cheer cheer to all whos far and near christmas day is in our grasp so long as we have hands to grasp christmas day will always be just as long as we have we welcome christmas
