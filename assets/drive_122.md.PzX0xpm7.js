naturally start to relax deeply learning how to go into hypnosis is a skill and you ll be learning it each time you hear this recording it s like a dance where my voice will lead you and you will naturally follow allowing yourself to go along with the suggestions being made if you re telling yourself this isn t working than that indeed is the reason that it isn t working convincing yourself that it is working is perhaps the very essence of hypnosis so now sit comfortably in a chair with your legs uncrossed feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your lap or on you legs or on the arms of a chair or lie down and close your eyes and begin to listen more closely to my voice while there is no harm in falling asleep and it indeed indicates that you did relax deeply it s generally better to stay conscience and absorb what is being said in a few moments i m going to ask you to look up above your head and to naturally turn to the light and this way your eyes will be turned strongly upward and will start to feel strained and grow tired and i ll begin to count down from five down to one until the eyes naturally close so now open your eyes and turn them upwards to gaze at a spot nearly directly above you and imagine a point of light shining directly into your eyes i m going to count from five down to one and as i do so your eyes will begin to feel tired and heavy like they want to close simply let them close and now five four three your eyes are are getting tired two eyes are getting very tired one i ve been having overwhelming bouts of sadness and self harming my depressions unimpressive it stems from stress or so they tell me hearts on fire yet uninspired i guess im preaching to the choir pessimistic narcissistic introspective hate required my obsession with

because it s never seen the sunshine and it s never felt the rain but casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chain oh she said casey it s been so long since i ve seen you here she said just a kiss to make a body smile see she said i ve put on new stockings just to please you lord she said casey can you only stay a while casey leaves the underground and stops inside the golden crown for something wet to wipe away the chill that s on his bones seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men who reach for anything they can to keep from going home standing in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by then he stumbles as he s leaving and he wonders if the reason is the beer that s in his belly or the tear that s in his eye oh she said i suppose you seldom think about me now she said now that you ve a family of your own still she said it s so blessed good to feel your body lord she said casey it s a shame to be alone","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"pauline more than a memory girl got to tell you what was a cold blue sofa and an oriental rug when

a fool in the forest and as he lay there sleeping a vision did appear upon his mantle shining a face of one so dear who had loved him in the springtime of a long forgotten year when the wildflowers did bloom in the forest she touched his grizzled fingers and she called him by his name and then he heard the joyful sound of children at their games in an old house on a hillside in some forgotten

he made me feel lonely and we i guess we knew it was a crime but i knew you would hold me right your love i could never fight chorus those restless nights so warm and wild his touch was ice your love was fire i know everyone needs to feel they re loved maybe i asked for too much sometimes i really felt so pushed and shoved but i never meant to hurt him at all when i slipped you would break my fall chorus maybe i m a fool but i just can t seem to settle down always thinking there s another star maybe that s the key cause love is never really sound and it s the only thing i can do cause i wasn t very good at being true and now i look back at all the broken dreams and wonder if i could have changed them i see that it was in the scheme of things cause still when i see your face i know nothing will replace chorus","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"back there in your room while you were gone i found the pages that she wrote to you my heart just froze but i couldn t stop myself i see what

needed her to face the world i wish that it could all just be erased i can t believe she could take my place as you came up the stairs you asked are you all right i d better go was all i said but

in some ways it was nice to have a place to belong but freedom called in its own way soft moonlit nights in her thoughts and the war raged on inside that she always fought chorus ah the love that plays in the strangest ways she felt his warm embrace like fire inside her and when the day would break it seemed her heart would shake but she knew he had her soul at stake chorus like a bird she was
