like any of us i bet he d just take a deep breath and he d let em all go and then he d take another deep breath and he d let em all go and then he d take another deep breath and he d hold it and then i bet he d feel hungry in a way that seems strange yes hungry for all the things he just can t change like the time he passed out in his own bedroom and his ex wife sewed him up in the sheet and she beat him with a broom and he forgave her and you think that that s rough then the irs came and they took away all his stuff they took his golf course and his recording studio and he just went on out and did another show so when it s all coming down on you i think you d better ask yourself what would willie do what would willie do well he d travel so far with nothing but a song and his old guitar and a tour bus and some semi trucks thirty crew men and a little bit of luck he loves all the people the rank and the randy if you don t believe it take a look at the family they ll tell you that it s true when it s all too much what would willie do what would willie do he d take a little time and talk to old rooster as they drive on down the line there s millions down that road and with a word he

progression as though theyve actually seen it this mindboggling selfishness as though materialistic shit can fix all your problems in situations and instances ive seen what money does to the soul it muddies it if theres no moral compass but youve amassed an amount of wealth then invest in a crucifix an attempt at saving yourself i can tell you its fucking hopeless but that would be pessimistic the poster child for contain negativity i will never be no longer am i lost in my thoughts im doing the best i can i have to put myself in their shoes how hypocritical am i to judge what someones been through or why the act they way they act and do the things that they do its all perspective we subject ourselves to different vices and my advice is be decisive with decisions you make dont be overly

his thoughts on yesterday how was it i asked and after a tap on the glass he looked my way then gave me this depressed expression and pressed his best just to say besides the tides and the grey skies it was ok and i said hey mister fish you did all that you wish you got nothing to complain about while hanging out in this abyss and he replied well existence is bliss there s so much that you missed besides get off the trip happiness is just a myth i said living in water is extremely more peaceful than life confined to a mind blinded by evil and forced to see through these two peep holes it seems i ve redeemed freedom not being limited by walls but that only means i qualify as ground for the sky when it falls that only means i qualify as ground for the sky when it falls that only means i qualify as ground for the sky when it falls that only means i qualify as ground for the sky when it falls but mr fish just laughed as i went on and on and on so i interrupted his chuckle putting up a middle finger and he boldly told me it s too bad i m such a thinker so arrogantly i asked how could someone think too much he added that insanity lingers and thoughts brought me to the brink of such he said you live inside a head that reminds me of my glass box and everyone s the same all brains are contained by your reality frame and chained to the terrain it s trained not to change and once you see what i ve explained you hit the jackpot and at that very moment it was like my eyes really opened the air that previously surrounded me was now an ocean still totally invisible except for minor pieces of debris then mr fish pushed up to the glass and he looked just like me my whole world spun around i didn t understand but i realized i was no longer a man so i thought about what he said and asked him what was going on and he said you didn t know it but you were the fish all along he said congratulations you did it you broke free you re just a fish like the rest of humanity now it took me a long time to get adjusted to this tank but now i know what i am and so to that man i give thanks i ve always lived inside this glass box that reminds him of his head it just goes to show ya that your mind is your own monster reality is what you make it and if you take it away you re just a fish like me swimming in the powdered water2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i ll be writing till i m dead

shed i ve trudged through the sediment in search of the rhythm dove soul first to bathe nude in its abyss paid dues and made music my religion now i listen close my eyes and forget i even exist i sing a bastard s tune inspired by the noise the ship made before it sank and was finally destroyed i flaunt the grin of a man made for disguising a boy who tried to avoid showing the cry in his voice but there s something special about the notes that he hears those scales are redemption unraveling repressed memories and when he breathes a new energy enters and consumes him to heal his wounds and unseal his doom if only i could make you understand but words are just words so i can t the universe s deepest art form keeps my heart warm with influence i tell ya ain t nothing quite as beautiful as music to be an angel you gotta earn your wings to control your own you gotta burn your strings to hit blackjack you gotta turn a king but to live forever all you gotta do is learn to sing i get a pleasure that s inevitably immeasurable and i won t let it be rejected by no man why does it have to be so damn difficult to live in the frame of a game that will slit your throat but i ve dug in the mud in search of the drum dove soul first to bathe nude in its abyss stayed true to the music now my favorite thing to do is close my eyes and forget that i even exist i hold this fistful of degenerate ideas for every genius that was murdered in the name of jesus still deaf to the bells that claimed to free us but i pay homage to my melody cause she s the sweetest the core of our spirit is naked the form of its are sacred blanketed by the original sound of the inner vibrations i m floating on the soft clouds of positive creation see i can look at a painting and admire the colors or

died made me remember all the subordinate feelings i cast aside and maybe i had lied when i said i was ok just getting along like a little song that stops to sing and say wild willow windy winter won

way so we could witness this kingdom people this song s for you kingdom people this song s for you so let s go verse 1 nine years old getting dropped off at sunday school class clowning with my boys i just wanna be cool see i grew up thinking that church was for the preacher until i met brothers who wanted to reach us and teach us how to study our bibles to see what it means and show christianity isn t just about what it brings but sadly there are some who live opposite scriptures christians to the public who muddy up the picture cause for too long cats like kells and mase been the spokesmen all the while the public see us as a joke man so this song s for the true shepherds who prove selfless whose aim is to aid the true helpless i mean brothers like spurgeon and piper tom nelson john edwards brothers who make disciples those who because of ezekiel 34 shepherd the flocks as a true pastor of the lord verse 2 i was a hardhead growing up in texas where the girls was fast acting and the men would plex us where nobody seems to care so my cousins was reckless but from moms and madea there was more that was expected from their perspective life wasn t over they all had a sense of hope that was based on jehovah and more over they knew the life to come they had a love for their people based on christ the son and as i write this song i can remember many times i left home mama crying just wishing i d try him well i tried him mama and i kept him too i praise god that madea that was praying me through thank you miss luke mama grant and aunt jessie mae mama all those who was praying through the faith this song s for you and knowing no one can compare to you to me madea s more than a tyler perry character verse 3 there are those that have gone on and gone home to worship at the throne but their lives live on it s their precedence of faith that gives the evidence of faith exhorting residents of grace to lay aside every weight that hinders our race true examples from
