words that jangle in your head why did summer go so quickly was it something that you said lovers walk along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of this song half remembered names and faces but to whom do they belong when you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware that

that even a house couldn t endure palms raised skyward his meager belongings collected on the floor singing songs to no one about nothing but crying because they mean so much it s these babblings that keep his life going keep the nickels flowing deep into his cup there we both were framed in awkward silence and i was in his living room invading his trust he finally said to me that he had one last cigarette to smoke and it was time to give it up but he laughed and added said he wasn t sure which to give up his life or the habit he said it s my habits that made my fingers weak when my chances came i couldn t grab it but it s my life that makes it hard and when my opportunities were there for free i chose my habits i half smiled and offered the most empathetic nod that i could conjure up and said i hear you brother i ve got problems too but words won t fill your cup i ve got responsibilities to face and they re woven tight to my dreams i ve got more bills to pay than i have time and i m starting to rip at the seams i ve got a plan and i know that if i stick to it i can accomplish happiness i ve got goals that beat my will and lately it s been hard to accept the challenge and he said hey man sounds like that s god talking to you and i don t know why you can t see you re so blind that you can t spare to make change because all your focus is on me all wrapped up in your own skin that you can t help set an old man free i ve been in your shoes before it feels like it was yesterday if not at all my existence has been a blink and for the life of me i can t remember what i saw that made so much sense to me even though i convinced myself that he was totally insane i bent over and lit his cigarette and told him to mind his own business because i was just waiting for my train and he said i ve been waiting here forever just dying in my skin and the only reason your living life is because your curious what ll happen in the end that might be true but why should i pay my hard earned attention to vagabond doctrine if you ve got so much knowledge to give why not treat yourself to what you re offering you probably have lived a hard life and i apologize but i have my own problems that you couldn t understand just like a lot of guys now here s a couple bucks go buy yourself whatever makes you happy even though i ve promised myself to not to pay for you to make my city look trashy he refused the money and sat there singing songs of love and hate i crammed the change in my pocket called him a lunatic and went on with my wait as i stood there hovering near his tiny frame i could feel his eyes judging me sadly it s as if he had to convince me that my life was on the wrong track and i needed it badly and i said hey old man your cigarettes all smoked up it s time for you to leave he looked at the trail of ash on his shirt and smiled as if it gave him some sort of relief he propped himself up collected his life and got prepared to become one with the night before he left he turned around and wished me luck with all my plans and said something about learning to walk before i ran before i knew it he was out of my sight and i had already forgotten his reasonings i could hear my train coming and home was on my mind not his cryptic meanings and then another traveler was on the platform and for some reason he was running towards me all i could see was his eyes but it s his words that will always stick with me through his heavy breaths he asked if i had just spent time with the old man i nodded in affirmation and tried to calm him so he could tell me why he ran and he said hey man that was god talking to you how could you not see that was god talking right to your face trying to hand you the keys he was right here and i can t understand why you chose to make him leave he just died in my arms right outside the station and said you were his only friend he begged me to tell you about his life make you see the light give you your chance again i cringed at the reality that was facing me i told the man i had no time for this and on my way i had to be right about that time my train pulled up and i made my escape i sat in the empty plastic seat and held tight to my fate that was decades ago and now i sit singing on my own platform my belongings stowed tightly in my bags handing out my sad sad songs and i say it s my habits that make my fingers weak when my chances come i can t grab them but it s my life that makes it hard and when my opportunities are there for free i choose my habits i have no responsibilities and as a result i no longer need my dreams i don t have any bills to pay it s like i m free but i m really in captivity i don t have any plans except to just sit here and try and weather the storm i wish i had goals but if i had those then i wouldn t be here warning you on my platform singing train songs","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m on the quest to enlightenment don t need no detour what you calling me for what

yeah if i didn t have you to hold me tight if i didn t have you to lie with at night if i didn t have you to share my sighs and to kiss me and dry my tears when i cry well i really think that i would have somebody else if i didn t have you someone else would do your love is one in a million you couldn t buy it at any price but of the nine point nine nine nine hundred thousand other possible loves statistically some of them would be equally nice or maybe not as nice but say smarter than you or dumber but better at sport or fucking tracing i m just saying i really think that i would probably have somebody else if i didn t have you someone else would do if i were a rich man fiddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle diddle dee i guess i would be with a surgeon or a model or a rellie of the royals or a kennedy or a nymphomaniacal exhibitionist heiress to a large chain of hotels if i were a rich man maybe i would fiddle fiddle diddle diddle with the rich man girls i m not saying that i d not love you if i was wealthy or handsome but realistically there s lots of fish in the sea and if i had a different rod i would conceivably land some even though i am fiscally consistently pitiable and considerably less brad pitt than brad pitiful am i really so poor and ugly that you think only you could possibly love me and i really think that i would probably have somebody else if i didn t have you someone else would do look i m not undervaluing what we ve got when i say that given the role chaos inevitably plays in the inherently flawed notion of fate it s abstruse to deduce that i found my soulmate at the age of 17 it s just mathematically unlikely that at a university in perth i happened to stumble on the one girl on earth specifically designed for me and if i may conjecture a further objection love is nothing to do with destined perfection the connection is strengthened the affection simply grows over time like a flower or a mushroom or a guinea pig or a vine or a sponge or bigotry or a banana and love is made more powerful by the ongoing drama of shared experience and the synergy of a kind of symbiotic empathy or something so i trust it would go without saying that i would feel really very sad if tomorrow you were to fall off something high or catch something bad but i m just saying i don t think you re special i mean i think you re special but you fall within a bell curve i mean i m just saying i really think that i would probably have somebody else i think you are unique and beautiful you make me happy just by being around but objectively you would have to agree that baby when i found you options were relatively thin on the ground you re lovely but there must be girls as lovely as you or maybe more open to spanking or table tennis i m just saying that i think that i would probably have somebody else i mean i reckon it s pretty likely that if for example my first girlfriend jackie hadn t dumped me after i kissed winston s ex girlfriend neah at steph s party back in 1993 enough variables would probably have been altered by the absence of that event to have meant the advent of a tangential narrative in which we don t meet which is to say there exists a theoretical hypothetical parallel life where what is is not as it is and i am not your husband and you are not my wife and i am a stuntman living in la married to a small blonde portuguese skier who when she s not training does abstract painting practises yoga and brews her own beer and really likes making home movies and suffers neck down alopecia but with all my heart and all my mind i know one thing is true i have just one life and just one love and my love that love is you and if it wasn t for you darling you i really think that i would possibly have somebody else if i didn t have you if i didn t have you someone else would do someone else would surely do5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"1 2 3 4 if you wanna be tongue tied you better know where i hide under the bleachers with pleasure

horns of a new moonlight caesars ghost i saw the wartime tides the prince of denmarks father still and quiet the whole world was looking to get drowned trees were a fist shaking themselves at the clouds i looked over curtains oh it s then that i knew that only a full house gonna make it through i became a thin blue wire that held the world above the fire so it was i saw behind heavens just a thin blue line if gods up there hes in a cold dark room the heavenly host are just the cold dark moons he bent down and made the world in seven days and ever since hes been a walking away mixing with nitrogen in lonely holes where neither seraphim or raindrops go i see an old man wandering the halls alone but only a full house gonna make a home and i became a thin blue stream the smoke between asleep and dreams and in that clear blue undertow saw royal city far below borders soft with refugees streets a swimming with amputees its a bible or a bullet they put over your heart its getting harder and harder to tell them apart the days are nights and the nights are long beating hearts blossom into walking bombs and those still looking in the clear blue sky for a sign get missiles from so high they might as well be divine and now the dogs are howling at your door singing about vengeance like its the joy of the lord bringing justice to the enemies not the other way round theyre guilty where killed and theyre killed where theyre found if whats loosed on earth will be loosed up on high its a hell of a heaven we must go to when we die where even laurel begs hardy for vengeance please the fat man s crying on his hands and his knees back in the peacetime he caught roses on the stage now he twists indecision takes bourbon for rage lead pellets peppering aluminum halcyon laudanum and opium he sings kiss thee hardy this poisoned cup his winding sheet is busy winding up in darkness he looks for the lights that have died you need faith for the same reasons that its so hard to find and this whole thing is headed for a terrible wreck and like good tragedy thats what we expect at night i make plans for a city laid down like the hips of a girl on the spring covered ground spirals and capitals and the twists of a script streets named for heroes that could almost exist fruit trees from eden and the gardens that seem to float like the smoke from a lithium dream cedar trees growing in the cool of the squares young women walking in the portals of prayer the future glass buildings and the past an address the weddings in pollen and the wine bottomless and all wrongs forgotten and all vengeance made right the suffering verbs put to sleep in the night the future descending like a bright chandelier the world just beginning and the guests in good cheer in royal city i fell into a trance cause its hell to believe there aint a hell of a chance i woke beneath a clear blue sky the sun a shout the breeze a sigh the old hometown and the streets i knew wrapped up in a royal blue i heard my friends laughing out across the fields girls in the gloaming and the birds on the wheel the raw smell of horses and the warm smell of hay cicadas electric in the heat of the day a run of three sisters and the flush of the land and the lake was a diamond in the valleys hand the straight of the highway and the scattered out hearts they were coming together they were pulling apart and angels everywhere were in my midst in the ones that i loved in the ones that i kissed i wondered what it was id been looking for above heaven s so big there aint no need to look up so i
