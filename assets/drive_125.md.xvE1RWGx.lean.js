audience of one where have they gone identities assume us as nine and five add up synchronizing watches to the seconds that we lost i looked up and saw you i know that you saw me we froze but for a

loved run away but what are we running from a show of hands from those in this audience of one where have they gone we re all okay until the day we re not the surface shines while the inside rots we

can hear all she says as she sits by his bed then one day his lips answer her in her own language the days quickly pass he loves making her laugh the first time he moves it s her hair that he touches she asks are you cursed he says i think that i m cured then he talks of the nile and the girls in bullrushes in new york he is laid in a glass covered case he pretends he is dead people crowd round to see him but each night she comes round and the two wander down the halls of the tomb that she calls a museum often he stops to rest but then less and less then it s her that looks tired staying up asking questions he learns how to read from the papers that she is writing about him and he makes corrections it s his face on her book more and more come to look families from iowa upper westsiders then one day it s too much he decides to get up and as chaos ensues he walks outside to find her she is using a cane and her face looks too pale but she s happy to see him as they walk he supports her she asks are you cursed but his answer s obscured in a sandstorm of flashbulbs and rowdy reporters such reanimation the two tour the nation he gets out of limos he meets other women he speaks of her fondly their nights in the museum but she s just one more rag now he s dragging behind him she stops going out she just lies there in bed in hotels in whatever towns they are speaking then her face starts to set and her hands start to fold and one day the dry fig of her heart stops its beating long ago on the ship she asked why pyramids he said think of them as an immense invitation she asked are you cursed he said i think that i m cured then he kissed her and hoped that she d forget that question2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i am an american aquarium drinker i assassin down the avenue i

but i m glad i took it because it was well worth it i got to read a couple books and do some research before i reached my verdict never thought that i was perfect always thought that i had a purpose i used to wonder if i d live to see my first kiss the most difficult thing that i did was recite my own words at a service realizing the person i was addressing probably wasn t looking down from heaven or cooking up something in hell s kitchen trying to listen in or eavesdrop from some other dimension it was self serving just like this is conveniently religious on easter sunday and on christmas the television went from being a babysitter to a mistress technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance til we just stayed distant and never touched now all we do is text too much i don t remember much from my youth maybe my memory is repressed or i just spent too much time wondering if i d live to have sex fell in love for the first time in fourth grade but i didn t have the courage to talk to her in eighth grade i wrote the note and slipped it in somebody else s locker considered killing myself because of that it was a big deal it was a blown cover it was over for me my goose was cooked stick a fork in me the jig is up i blew my chances the rest is history our future was torn asunder it became abundantly clear i was only brought here to suffer at least i didn t include my name thankfully i wrote the whole note in code and it had ten layers of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open plus it was set to self destruct whoever read it probably died laughing i wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened a year later i came to understand that wasn t love that i was feeling for her i had someone else to obsess over i was older i was very mature i forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph cause i was failing math disconnected the phone when i thought the teacher would call my home i checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road steamed open a couple envelopes like i was in private detective mode if you snoop around long enough for something in particular you re guaranteed to find it for better or worse that s how i learned it s best to just keep some things private it was the best of times it was the end of times it was the best of times it was the end of times it was the best of times it was the end of times it was the best of times it was the end of times i was always on deck i was next in line an only child with a pen and pad writing a list of things i could never have the walls in my house were paper thin every squabble seemed to get deafening if my memory serves me correctly i made it a point to void and forget some things probably to keep from being embarrassed never meant to upset or give grief to my parents kept my secrets hid my talents in my head never under the mattress therapy couldn t break me never learned a word that would ensure safety so i spoke softly and i tiptoed often the door to my room was like a big old coffin the way that it creaked when i closed it shut anxieties peaked when it opened up as if everything that i was thinking would be exposed i still sleep fully clothed it was the best of times it was beautiful it was brutal it was cruel it was business as usual heaven it was hell used to wonder if i d live to see twelve when i did i figured that i was immortal loved to dance but couldn t make it to the formal couldn t bear watching my imaginary girlfriend bust a move with any other dudes tone loc was talking bout a wild thang but i was still caught up in some child thangs scared of a god who couldn t spare the rod it was clearly a brimstone and fire thang pyromaniac kleptomaniac couldn t explain my desire to steal that fire now i add it to my rider like please oh please don t throw me in that patch of brier it was the best of times it was the end of times the school counselor was clueless cause i never skipped classes perfect attendance imperfect accent speech impediment they could never really fix and i faked bad eyesight so i could wear glasses considered doing something that would cripple me i wanted a wheelchair i wanted the sympathy i wanted straight teeth so then came braces four years of headgear helped me change faces it was the best of times it was the end of times now i wonder if i ll live to see marriage wonder if i ll live long enough to have kids wonder if i ll live to see my kids have kids if i do i m gonna tell em how it is don t listen when they tell you that these are your best years don t let anybody protect your ears it s best that you hear what they don t want you to hear better to have pressure from peers than not have peers beer won t give you chest hair spicy food won t make it curl when you think you ve got it all figured out and then everything collapses trust me kid it s not the end of the world 10","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"in the middle of the night in the

oh lord please don t let me be misunderstood  i m watchin tv the other day right got this white guy on there talking bout black guys talking about how young black guys are targeted targeted by who america you see one in every one hundred americans are locked up one in every nine black americans are locked up and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail a young motherfucker to jail would be less to send his or her young ass to college see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack cocaine yeah stuff like that meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine the police are only i don t want to say only right but shit only logic by riding around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood and um you know the other thing is mostly foundyou know where i m going but why bring a motherfucker to jail if it s not gonna stand up in court because this drug ain t that drug you know level 3 level 4 drugs shit like that mhm i guess it s all a misunderstanding and um i sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers you know that one in every nine we probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and it s not like your suburbs we don t have the things that you have why i really don t want to know the answer but i guess we just misunderstood huh yeah you know we don t have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers the real criminals you know sex offenders rapists serial killers shit like that oh don t get scared don t get scared i know you saw one of them sex offender papers don t trip he live right on the end of your block mhm yeah that nigga live right down the street from you sex offender on the level 3 drug convicted ex con yeah check him out and what you got you got daughters son what you got yeah well you know what don t stop the track that s the good weed you know what i have a fucking daughter you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain t the reason why i live next door to him meaning he didn t rap his way to my fuckin neighborhood he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood you move him out bring him to jail for life and then you move in a sex offender hahaha then give me a paper haha is that a misunderstanding cause i don t understand it another thing let me take my glasses off cause i want to see the reaction on the faces when i say this uhh mr al sharpton here s why i don t respect you and nobody like you mhm see you re the type that gets off on gettin on other people haha that s not good no homo and rather un human i should say i mean given the fact that humanity well good humanity rather to me is helping one another no matter your color or race but this guy and people like him they d rather speculate before they informate if that s a word haha you know spec before check anyway meanin i d much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton haha hold on i ain t finished wit you man gotta pluck the ashes mhm hold on um mr sharpton and anyone like you you don t know me so if you re not gonna try to then what you say or think about me or whatever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost to me and it doesn t make you a good person to criticize before you improvise doesn t necessarily make you a bad person neither but the characteristics fall heavily into bad s way haha but since i am human i am good and bad as well but i try my hardest to stay good and some of the things i do and say may be bad or just not too good but i do try so with that said i don t fault you i mean you re only human good or bad but i also don t respect you and i don t care if that s good or bad haha you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me you re just another don king with a perm just a little more political and that just means you re a little un human than us humans and now let me be human by saying fuck al sharpton and anyone like him fuck if you understand me i love being misunderstood haha why cause i live in the suburbs but i come from the hood bring the hook in but oh i m just a soul

searched for a comforting notion and the rich silver walls looked ready to fall as they shook in doubtful devotion the ice cubes would clink as they freshened their drinks wet their minds in bitter

we saw that rebellion was growing now everything s lost as they kneel by the cross where the blood of christ is still flowing too late for their sorrow they ve reached their tomorrow and reaped the seed they were sowing now harvested by the ringing of revolution in tattered tuxedos they faced the new heroes and crawled about in confusion and they sheepishly grinned for their memories were dim of the decades of dark execution hollow hands raised they stood there amazed in the shattering of their illusions as the windows were smashed by the ringing of revolution down on our knees we re begging
