king roy wilkins or any of these compromising negroes who say exactly what the white man wants to hear is interviewed anywhere in the country you don t get anybody to offset what they say but whenever

was a teacher from god jesus reply made him stop regarding the kingdom of god no ones going in in fact you cant even see it unless youre born again that must have consumed and stretched his mind because he said can a man enter his mothers womb a second time naturalistically the only way for him to hear it jesus said you must be born of the water and the spirit no other way to enter heaven that sounds like ezekiel 36 25 27 in this new birth the spirit is the source and the agent the water symbolizes spiritual purification flesh can only produce flesh thats true and factual regenerating work of the spirit is supernatural its kind of like the wind which is free east to west cant perceive the steps you can only see its effects in in the same way the holy spirit chooses whom he pleases to sovereignly open their eyes to the truth of jesus  if it wasnt for the spirits mysterious operation we would all be under serious condemnation id still be rejecting his son if god hadnt said let there be light like genesis 1 and just like the light could not refuse to shine irresistible grace renewed my mind lets exalt the king who died and truly is risen the new birth is not the effect of human decision but the cause it changes our natural habitation and situation its a radical transformation i was cursed and polluted so my dirt was inexcusable with new internal pupils his person is

with a view of love still fading weve got to figure this out why in every town the sky is falling in and all around us could it be you and i are the ones to blame at times we know which way the wind is leading it draws us in with a swift cool breeze and passing through our lungs fills our chest with a new beat to shrug off the darkness beneath our feet and what of romance is it worth pursuing when even the right ones end being wrong it seems weve made a mess of whats more than a feeling oh my god does it break your heart the distance here is growing and were in danger of missing what good is left the ones who stay while knowing just what an awful mess we can be so just slow down to take in the air we ve been quick to dismiss we re falling faster now but this is hardly the end woah it s more than simple distance when i found the water s up to my neck i m running purely on persistence hoping faith will force forward each step so shake your mind from slowly sinking under there s no time to sleep and wonder what would life be like had i been brave  the distance here is growing and were in danger of missing what good is left the ones who stay while knowing just what an awful mess we can be so just slow down to take in the air we ve been quick to dismiss we re falling faster now but this is hardly the end woah so what if change is simply looking forward and letting go of what doors have been closed maybe courage lies in moving on even though your fear begs not to the distance here is growing and im afraid that the memory of your kiss will be enough to stop me","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"he he he he he ha ha ha ha ha he he he he he little girls little girls everywhere i turn i can see them little girls little girls night and day i eat sleep and breathe
