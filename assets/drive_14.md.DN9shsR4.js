get me to look at my life and face it sober the one good thing in all those years of dark not that you re perfect but i know that you re perfectly pure of heart and behind that smile i can see that you hurt inside there must be constant reminders around you keeping that pain alive i don t mean to preach lord knows that i ve made mistakes but i want to see you be brave one more time let it pave the way  your mother he tried to hold her hands never came through all the things we do do you understand in the city of bastards it were a bad man but you keep digging for the good trying to find it

sumter square slum king looking for another motherfucking chance to re break the broken in is something and that s the part i m never going to get growing up is more than just a mind state and owning all your debts blowing out the breath i don t feel so tall so tell me how am i supposed to reach anything anything at all anything at all tell me how can i grow to see the change in my life i wanted to overcome the battle inside what is owed to anxiety s hold is there a better way to figure it out i sweep it all under the rug cover up the loss found inside of me and wash it down with blood i was born with an option and taught to swim a flood but the older i become i start to humor giving up so pick it up listen to all of the words in my head and understand i ll have a shaky hand until they re said and i don t know if i can get my mind state back but i would travel to the end just to feel that grasp and that would be everything speak it through the can on the line and prophesied the future from the twinkle in my eye i could wrinkle up and die in that room where the dreams started talking to me constantly and dancing through the sky i m alive but growing up has proved to be a task and left a couple daydreams broken down and smashed looking through the glass i don t feel so tall so tell me how am i supposed to reach anything anything at all anything at all  tell me how can i grow to

faith in the dark amen when the lights hurt my brain sometimes i pray for a blackout with the candles ablaze nothing more i crave than a blackout let there be no light let there be no light til the sunrise let there be no light only then will i open my eyes let there be no light  is it that way you move your hips or that piercing on your lips or that disaronno flowing like its serving through a drip i am no longer a person im a star up in the bitch so i talk with body language my vocabulary is shit got a feeling that youre feeling how im feeling would waking up with me tomorrow morning make your evening if so lets find a corner in the place that i can breathe in my egos claustrophobic you should know weve had a threesome leave it when the lights hurt my brain sometimes i pray for a blackout with the candles ablaze nothing more i crave than a blackout let there be no light let there be no light til the sunrise let there be no light only then will i open my eyes let there be no light take away my light take away my shine take away my eyesight give me a beat and let me rhyme take away my light take away my shine take away my eyesight give me a beat and let me rhyme take away my light take away my shine take away my eyesight give me a beat and let me rhyme take away my light take away my shine take away my eyesight give me a beat and let me rhyme when the lights hurt my brain sometimes i pray for a blackout with the candles ablaze nothing more i crave than a blackout let there be no light let there be no light til the sunrise let there be no light only then will i

before that day i always said you d be my pioneer and if i was in trouble you d say fear not cause i m here so if you didn t know you d get the idea cause every night i stayed awaiting homesick and so

kid i used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing i thought they were both pork chops and because my grandmother thought it was cute and because they were my favourite she let me keep doing it not really a big deal one day before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees i fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body i didnt want to tell my grandmother about it because i was afraid id get in trouble for playing somewhere that i shouldnt have been a few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise and i got sent to the principals office from there i was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home i saw no reason to lie as far as i was concerned life was pretty good i told her whenever im sad my grandmother gives me karate chops this led to a full scale investigation and i was removed from the house for three days until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises news of this silly little story quickly spread through the school and i earned my first nickname pork chop to this day i hate pork chops im not the only kid who grew up this way surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called and we got called them all so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us that wed be lonely forever that wed never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool shed so broken heart strings bled the blues as we tried to empty ourselves so we would feel nothing dont tell me that hurts less than a broken bone that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away that theres no way for it to metastasize it does she was eight years old our first day of grade three when she got called ugly we both got moved to the back of the class so we would stop get bombarded by spit balls but the school halls were a battleground where we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day we used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse outside wed have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there in grade five they taped a sign to her desk that read beware of dog to this day despite a loving husband she doesnt think shes beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half of her face kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldnt quite get the job done and theyll never understand that shes raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word mom because they see her heart before they see her skin because shes only ever always been amazing he was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree adopted not because his parents opted for a different destiny he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy started therapy in 8th grade had a personality made up of tests and pills lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs four fifths suicidal a tidal wave of anti depressants and an adolescence of being called popper one part because of the pills ninety nine parts because of the cruelty he tried to kill himself in grade ten when a kid who could still go home to mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it as if depression is something that can be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit to this day he is a stick of tnt lit from both ends could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moments before its about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration he remains a conversation piece between people who cant understand sometimes becoming drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity we werent the only kids who grew up this way to this day kids are still being called names the classics were hey stupid hey spaz seems like each school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound are they just the background noise of a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like kids can be cruel every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers from clowns to carnies all of these were miles ahead of who we were we were freaks lobster claw boys and bearded ladies oddities juggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal but at night while the others slept we kept walking the tightrope it was practice and yes some of us fell but i want to tell them that all of this shit is just debris leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be and if you cant see anything beautiful about yourself get a better mirror look a little closer stare a little longer because theres something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself you signed it they were wrong because maybe you didnt belong to a group or a clique maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it you have to believe that they were wrong they have to be wrong why else would we still be here we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on a highway and if in some way we are dont worry we only got out to walk and get gas we are graduating members from the class of fuck off we made it not the faded echoes of voices crying out names will never hurt me of course they did but our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty247","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"this

the wall is coming down down down down i see you coming round cause your wall is coming down i don t have to build a fortress to hide what you can t see i don t have to be the master and hold onto the key sometimes i feel so certain that we were meant to be but i guess it s fine if you disagree so whenever we turn the wheel peace talking make a deal you remind me of palestine and i feel so israel look at all the walls i ve built and look at all the guards you ve killed and if the gates would open would it be more loving or would all my fears turn real so for now i suppress your demonstration and i undress you here s the question is this love making or masturbation if every touch feels like instigation i m so sure if we all trusted the force of love even if our past is awful also break our pride in the torso whatever it takes for down these walls go in some ways we re east and west and the wall is coming down some times we celebrate other times we say what have we done and i feel you holding on and i m holding on too but no matter what we say or do the wall is coming down the wall is coming down down down down i see you coming round cause the wall is coming

no one is feeling her burden they just keep giving her sermons if they listened with more discernment they could tell she s hurting her speech is just an illusion she s scared of the end conclusion if she shares her doubt she feels her image may become ruined shes holding her fears in tears in she ll be dead by years in shes not thinking through how god forgives sins until then her nights are long
