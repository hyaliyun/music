the best because it s all that life accepts and so we kill it like a buffalo with awe and with respect don t ask god just holler at the sky cause she ll tell it to you plainly in the clouds that whisper by and praise the shapes and then praise the way they change and they ll teach you not to pray to light without you prayin to rain so i pray to hands and i pray to needs and i pray to blades of grass to find forgiveness in the weeds but as for health i just never did believe and so i never prayed myself except to those that prayed for me the story goes or the way that i was told there was a king that always felt too high and then he fell too low and so he called all the wise men to the hall and he begged them for a gift to end the rises and the falls  but here s the thing they came

answers you dont have to fix this but i am so new to this just being here and they took all the parts of me i wasnt ready to lose and i wondered if id ever wake up as somebody new tired run me down run me in the ground i will build a lighthouse there somehow danielle bennett april ran me down left me looking at the backside of a pig hurt at the end of the month mud thick as thighs was smeared across my eyelids and lipcorners and all over my spirit so tired this voice i am losing is both a red and white flag that tells a more honest story than my mouth does im tired of the discipline it takes to say no of the daily quits and the daily ask each message a jagged skip and whatever groove i had finally slid into tired of being a thread always pulling through of showing up to a keyboard unimpressed by anything i have to offer i understand i too am unimpressed by my own biography tired of wanting to call my way through skin until i am an indistinct skeleton slinking out unnoticed perhaps then i wouldnt be held the fire of my own splintered dreamboards shrink me tiny enough to escape failure by anyone of my hundred definitions help me believe that this art was only ever an experiment im tired of doing my best of telling the sugar to let me go of being looked at like the next shiny trophy a feeling like a ladder rung like an empty promised land im tired of what it takes to get clear of how heavy the fighting heart weighs in of the not quite almost just wait here of the questioning of my own aloneness of my own enoughness of my own too muchness april reminds me that i am a six figure grave and whoever taught me what that would mean where is the triangle of blame that promise me relief one day where is the relief in any of this one day alex blue ive played every angle and ive gotten good at it so why am i losing it my sanity now i guess that my life wasnt built on my record to win all thats left is a prayer on my breath im enough as i am tired run me down run me in the ground i will build a lighthouse there somehow danielle bennett the truth is i am only bothered when i think or i know i have completely lost control my reputation the feels the knowing i have chased and begged them home even in my dreams but i never learned to lasso so im doing my best for the thousandth time to actually let it go and anyone whos ever eventually nailed crow pose or finally hit five miles knows that repetition expecting a different result isnt always insanity sometimes its just a way of growth i am flaking mud really i am left in no ones dust i am miles behind and i am still winning i wil never forget my own name i am letting us all off my hooks i am showing up even when other people dont i am unlearning how to be tough and my fine hit curled kinks rarely dry pretty but how refreshing to love myself however i become i am not forcing resolve because im not sure thats the way life folds but i am reconciling every version of myself because i want them to meet one day and have a good laugh at how right we swore we were i am not made of formulas so i can no longer respond on your cue i m gonna start asking questions that may make me seem slow but i am labeling that a good four letter word and i figured out that two pieces of dark chocolate a day are not adding more inches to my waist than nearly three decades of stress i asked this body to stomach the manna has come enough to know that i will not be buried alive and ive never watched but i can tell i am beautiful when im writing and i know there is a humble man saving the rest of his fourth of julys for my firework giddy applause and i dont know where he is but i know he doesnt play hide and seek and i know i want to tell him that i havent been waiting ive been creating a hotel of stories he can thank for the shameless crooked smile ive become alex blue tired run me down run me in the ground i will build a lighthouse there somehow danielle bennett i am flaking mud i am waking up praise april is gone and i think may was a new sun and ive never loved the sound of crumble as i do now under all that earth i got soft somehow i got a second draft biography it says im not much of a sailor but ive built some sort of boat if you judge me by my crew i am thoroughly good if you judge me by results i am a two time world champion of facing what i feared the most i have been published by several renowned atlases for my work repairing lighthouses using only sound youll know theyre mine when you see them how the lights loop haphazardly like theyre completely out of control alex blue i will build a lighthouse there somehow3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"yeah yeah yeah yeah if i if i haha dream i said if i was a cop man i d probably be a crooked one and when i was a youngin always

taken doesn t seem to stop here but doesn t seem to go anywhere else and your heart rests in your chest like a charm round your neck that you couldn t find words to refuse and this high horse you ride it has broken its stride as it leads us through worlds built for you so walk with me a little bit further so i can find the tenderness you keep inside god made you with a taste for the madness in love but you confuse your gift with your pride and i can t help you with removing that bandage i will leave you all to yourself while you heal as i m learning time is a language and it s the best way to explain how i feel and while the magician you meet sweeps you off your feet saying he ll teach you tricks all for free i ll be in the way that you laugh as he cuts you in half and holds you up for the crowds all to see so forgive me for feeling so strongly but i feel like we can finally agree that true lovers always end up lonely cause they know how good it could be i ve heard the men in your wake describe you as a snake as you slip away when they start to wilt but i firmly believe you re a lot more like eve as she enjoys a bit of her guilt oh","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"a ballerina in

the center of a stage from the words used in a love note or from an empty page while i struggle with these beauties and my renditions end up dry i m like a bird that crashes into the window that was drawn to the reflection of the sky and the more i try to speak the more i lose that earthly tone and before heaven proves me hopeless i won t forget my way back home ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh i admit

been big in the biz like irving azoff get away with more loot than bernie madoff dolphin face plates i d be eating birthday cake off but i ain t tryna let them guys in suits walk all over me like thai masseuses hollywood is full of rich fat old dudes pointing at their trophy wives like i met that bitch at whole foods they say things like let s be in touch and get nothing but the finger like when lesbians touch i don t walk around town as a pedestrian much i don t place value on trophies thespians clutch not a bat of the eyes at the academy prize the hype s horse shit the flattery s lies so if your mic s cordless i hope your battery dies it s that type of performance i badly despise tell a critic write a song tell a blogger to perform it live they d have better luck playing frogger on the 405 you don t stand on any ground on which to base judgments or stand underground as if you judge basements your list make these rappers conceited high up in the ranks when they should be unseated they overrated like french fries at in n out or some other shit that i don t give a fucking shit about you bloody marks are all snark i can see you sippin cutty sark in a golf cart so meet me at the hipster bar and have a pickle back shot i fucked your sister in her car back when nickelback was hot back when me and herbs would just kick it at the spot with a 40 ounce of mickies and a nickel sack of pot but it s different now in certain kinds of ways except that we still be blurting lines for days and stepping out of that purple kind of haze only thing changed is the phrase no smoking in the

always say i ll wait till tomorrow like i m silverchair change change change my mind repeats sounding like a scratched vinyl record of an old obama speech one last record made i ll quit the touring life then i ll go and get domesticated with a boring wife people saying his career really took off when he stopped rapping and entered that chili cook off he really took the golf nasty with a pitching wedge plus get some out the deep sand la a fishing dredge the game ends and the fun fades as i tell my lame friends about my son s grades but one day it s back to the bottle fall off the wagon horsepower full throttle cause living with sobriety s excruciating pain and the thing i desire s a hallucinating brain i ll even get a tribal doctor to vouch ayahuasca on the couch next to oscar the grouch enough molly to probably convert my posture to slouch i ll sit tight shit right in a colostomy pouch senior citizen livin off moonshine and pizza hookers at noontime mainline levitra and when i finally develop emphysema i ll buy a shotgun for permanent anesthesia it won t matter i m an organ donor hunched over in the corner when the coroner comes over and sees me covered in blood like a maniac s bib after treating a baby like a baby back rib as he looks around at my insanely wack crib and it looks like a place where someone who smoked crack lived he sees writings on the wall looking like mad libs nonsensical rhymes parenthetical ad libs and he sees the whole scene in flashes his mind rehashes brain fragment smashes and blood splashes the coffee table glass crashes but he ain t gonna see no ashes no smoking in the house don t even waste my time i ain t the patient kind you must be out your mind telling me them fucking lies5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the sun is old on

giant gull came flying and the children got ready to sit on its wing they waved to the raindrops as they soared o er the trees the wind tossed their hair high flashing gold on the sea they came to the castle and there they did fall and they saw all the sadness through the crystal wall a princess lay a sleeping so gentle and kind whilst her prince took to battle with his confused mind the clash of bright metal brought the children fear but their cloaks of blue satin dried up all of his tears thus children held hands and they spelled out her name all the golden children became a golden chain it lies on a white throne in a magic place with a tunic of velvet and a gown of white lace my sword it lies broken and cast in a lake in the dream i was told that my princess would wake","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i really need to get up out of this hole man i m really really sinking deep down in this hole i need to get out of this shit i m serious like i really wanna go into

oh the sad thing is i said that shit out loud drunk and actin dumb it s the truth but i ain t proud no i don t want to be looked at like this when i m gone so i apologize to all the girls that i have done wrong oh yeah focused on the money tryna get rich cause i got girls that love me outside pretty inside ugly kinda paranoid they won t something from me like the girl that thinks that i can make her famous maybe if she sing with me she ll no longer be nameless but that s dumb shit cause i ain t even made it but still spendin money like i have when we re faded and boyfriends they hatin whose girlfriends i m dating tryna get it on like ryan reynolds while i m waiting i ll be patient on success and shit i m never sick of it i m tryna be what everybody else is and i don t need friends i don

alcohol not all the pills just keep at it yeah you know the drill you give me head then after ask me what s the deal if we re together or if this is where it ends but you already know that i told you we were friends this is something you don t want and i know that you don t i prefer to stop it here i never thought that you were a hoe you just said that you would do something that other girls won t i admit i got some issues cause whenever we re alone i refuse to put my hand on yours or look you in the eye but i d never hesitate to put my hands between your thighs and right before the clothes come off is where i draw the line because sex involves some feelings that are more than in your mind they re in your heart and those are feelings i don t have least not for you even though i got your back cause the feelings that you got for me i don t have for you i m sorry that i said but i said it cause it s true i don t wanna lie more than i already do don t say that you love me i won t say i
