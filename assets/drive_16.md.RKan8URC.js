be a most important piece of personal private news i m going to write a tear stained letter mark it personal private news and i hope you ll keep it to yourself and don t go around crying the blues giving off a bad impression as to what went really wrong when what it was was that suddenly the music was all gone and this man and this woman got cut off in the middle of our song i m going to write a tear stained letter i m going to put it to a tune so i ll be sending with it a sweet melody for you and not some red hot upbeat zinger that ll set your body on fire but a hunk of love included meant to take you a little higher and to settle on your sweet sweet mind at night when you retire i m going to write a tear stained letter1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"softly and tenderly jesus is calling

i m feeling forever stuck in these strings that s supposed to be severed as if its not enough feeling ashamed i guess i got your heart caught up in the same game and they tell me but now the feelings

with thousand bows of green and conrad was sitting with face a shine when he suddenly stopped as he stitched a twine and he said old friends at dawn today when the cock was crowing the night away the lord appeared in a dream to me and said i m coming your guest to be so i ve been busy with feet astir strewing my shop with branches of fern the table is spread and the kettle is shined and over the rafters the holly is twined now i ll wait for my lord to appear and listen closely so i will hear his step as he nears my humble place and i ll open the door and look on his face so his friends went home and left conrad alone for this was the happiest day he had known for long since his family had passed away and conrad had spent many a sad christmas day but he knew with the lord as his christmas guest this christmas would be the dearest and best so he listened with only joy in his heart and with every sound he would rise with a start and look for the lord to be at his door like the vision he had had a few hours before so he ran to the window after hearing a sound but all he could see on the snow covered ground was a shabby beggar whose shoes were torn and all of his clothes were ragged and worn but conrad was touched and he went to the door and he said you know your feet must be frozen and sore i have some shoes in my shop for you and a coat that will keep you warmer too so with grateful heart the man went away but conrad noticed the time of day and wondered what made the lord so late and how much longer he d have to wait when he heard a knock he ran to the door but it was only a stranger once more a bent old lady with a shawl of black with a bundle of kindling piled on her back she asked for only a place to rest but that was reserved for conrad s great guest but her voice seemed to plead don t send me away let me rest for awhile on christmas day so conrad brewed her a steaming cup and told her to sit at the table and sup but after she left he was filled with dismay for he saw that the hours were slipping away and the lord hadn t come as he said he would then conrad felt sure he had misunderstood when out of the stillness he heard a cry please help me and tell me where am i so again he opened his friendly door and stood disappointed as twice before it was only a child who d wandered away and was lost from her family on christmas day again conrad s heart was heavy and sad but he knew he should make the little girl glad so he called her in and he wiped her tears and quieted all her childish fears then he led her back to her home once more but as he entered his own darkened door he knew the lord was not coming today for the hours of christmas had passed away so he went to his room and knelt down to pray and he said dear lord why did you delay what kept you from coming to call on me for i wanted so much your face to see when soft in the silence a voice he heard lift up your head for i kept my word three times my shadow crossed your floor and three times i came to your lonely door i was the beggar with bruised cold feet and i was the woman you gave something to eat i was the child on the homeless street three times i knocked and three times i came in and each time i found the warmth of a friend of all the gifts love is the best and i was honored to be your christmas guest","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"god rest ye merry gentlemen

believe it took me quite so long to take the forbidden step is this something that i might regret come on come on nothing ventured nothing gained you are the one the lonely heart that can t be tamed come on come on i m hoping that you feel the same this is something that i can t forget i thought that we would just be friends things will never be the same again it s just the beginning it s not the end things will never be the same again it s not a secret anymore now we ve opened up the door starting tonight and from now on we ll never never be the same again never be the same again now i know that we were close before i m glad i realized i need you so much more and i don t care what everyone will say it s about you and me and we ll never be the same again  i thought that we would just be friends things will never be the same again it s just the beginning it s not the end things will never be the same again it s not a secret anymore now we ve opened up the door starting tonight and from now on we ll never never be the same again never be the same again uh check it night and day black beach sand to red clay the us to uk nyc to la from sidewalks to highways see it will never be the same what i m saying my mind frame never changed so you came and rearranged but sometimes it seems completely forbidden to discover those feelings that we kept so well hidden when there s no competition and you render my condition though improbable it s not impossible for a love that could be unstoppable but wait i find lines between fate and destiny do you believe in the things that were just meant to be when you tell me the stories of your quest for me picturesque is the picture you paint effortlessly and as our energies mix and begin to multiply everyday situations they start to simplify so things will never be the same between you and i we intertwine our life forces and now were unified i thought that we would just be friends things will never be the same again it s just the beginning it s not the end things will never be the same again it s not a secret anymore now we ve opened up the door starting tonight and from now on we ll never never be the same again come on come on our things will never be the same again you are the one never be the same again it s not a secret anymore never be the same again it s not a secret anymore never be the same again never be the same again never be the same again never be the same again never be the same again3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"yo big shaq the one and only man s not hot never hot skrrat skidi kat kat boom two plus two

brew after smokin stopped in oakland got the munchies for some soul food so we stopped to get a bite to eat at the local barbecue it s just another boring monday and there s nothing else to do now as we stepped out of the car i heard someone behind me fighting so i turn to look and find out what s the cause of this excitement one brother was a dopefiend and the other was a dopeman and the dope man had an ak said he ll spray and he s not jokin well it seems to be the dopefiend owed the dope man for his product and he swore if he did not pay he would end up getting shot up now i could not walk away cause i got caught up in the scene wondering what would happen to this poor and helpless fiend well my homie michael cooley said let s go and make our order what s the use in watchin two men stand out here fight over quarters while i walked inside the diner and all the dope fiends waved to me heard the sound of several gunshots and i ran outside to see another gunshot rings another siren screams another mother cries cause another innocent dies all the people in the diner ran outside to see the big show it was just another party for them to see just who they would know but for me i held concern i wanted to go see the outcome would the mother have her son tonight or would she live her life without one i made it to the streets i almost cried right on the spot not only had the fiend died but a small girl had been shot and my heart could take no more i felt a tear roll down my face that was daddy s bullet but she took it in his place  another gunshot rings another siren screams another mother cries cause another innocent dies i tried to make my way through the crowd so i could go help the baby she could barely speak but she whispered mister can you please save me so i screamed out someone help me but i dont think they could hear and if they did they didn t care oh how i hated everyone there the baby lie here dying and i wondered what could i do the cameramen and newspapers had come to get their interviews to them it s just a story and they can t see the tragedy to them it doesn t matter cause it ain t it wasn t their family i don t think i ll be back cause it ll never be the same here so i wipe away the tears and leave the scene the way i came here though some people say it s crazy and the food could have been finer i ll never forget never forget the night at dopefiend s diner another gunshot rings another siren screams another mother cries cause another innocent dies do do do do do do do do 9","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i speak fast and i m not gonna

the worst thing that they taught me was insanity is bad all this humanity i have is not destroyed but it s eroded i never knew to get stronger that you ve gotta be broken i never knew that doors close
