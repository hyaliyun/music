heart full of stone you know i had to redefine what i grind on success is dangerous if you don t do it right he gave us everything for pointing to him right so toast to the king who gave me some new dreams everything for his name that s how i do things never knew how lost i was till i found god then i couldn t hear his voice it was drowned out i was just chasing things selfish dreams now i see what he has for me it s the good life uh huh i grew up with those dodgers and those angels where wings get mangled and they rock a broken halo success is an idol from hollywood to diego no hablo if you don t speak with the pesos and there favorite dollar sign is too much more green more lust more taste more touch i had an appetite that ate from the devil s power at every bite to see the rise i m kissing my life goodbye if i find i have a need this world cannot meet then i know this life is a place where my hope should not be i ve been chasing those things that are real fake this is not a real place this is a dream state functional saviors ain t hip they re a real waste what s the palace going to offer that a manager can t pain sorrow and empty treasures spite the creator and deem creation simply better the world offers a lot of things but it s really lying and to the lord the good life is really dying i m the lord s possession so my heart s in the heavens true religion in my jeans and stop guessing  even the sun goes down heroes die eventually great careers end in the industry empires implode you may go down in history but everything will go down eventually look you could stack bread but you can t stop death and there won t be any comfort offered you in that bed all get laid out the games get played out in a maze headed to the grave and there is no way out you can t outlast life it fades out fast death is coming for us all everything gon pass so look at it from that angle dag my dreams gotta be bigger and greater than that how is it persecuted martyrs in asia were living out there dreams though they was walking in danger their dreams are what lifted up the heart of the savior and living in a way to show that s what they wait for they wasn t stackin up the cake but was walking in favor living a good life because they want with the maker my dreams are different you know that i ve been changed now the good life is the life that s been laid

beat would have been outrageous but when your heart skips a beat it s ruthless and aimless she caught my attention in her fishnets then she reeled me in expecting nothing more than kissed necks and quick sex that weren t the case with this platinum princess she d attracted my interest so i wanted to impress upon her all the positive things that come from having more than just a one night fling but that s something easier in theory than in practice since pick up lines are tactics to get prey to the mattress and this actress is practiced in shunning such theatrics when put upon daily by tactless geriatrics so my genuine advances are met with perfect scepticism throwing compliments but she just straight elects to miss em her lips were put on this earth for dispersing wisdom god forbid i suggest she lets me kiss them but i really want to know what she thinks of me because i m loving every idiosyncrasy but i ain t one to jump through hoops to make a first impression been there done that learnt the worst of lessons we want to be loved for who we appear to be instead of who we are our real selves take a backseat behind the pomp and the faade and that s as true of the rude boys

hey there how how s it going long time no see i know i haven t been around much lately but it didn t seem like you wanted me to be the last time i sent down a message you nailed it to the cross so i figured i d just leave you to it let you be your own boss but i ve been keeping an eye on you i have and it s amazing how you ve grown all your technological advances and the problems you ve overthrown and all the beautiful art you ve created with such grace and such finesse but i admit there are a few things i m afraid have impressed me less so i m writing to apologize for all the horrors committed in my name although it was never what i intended i feel i should take my share of the blame all the good i tried to do was corrupted when organized religion got into full swing what i thought were quite clear messages were taken to unusual extremes my teachings taken out of context to meet the agendas of others interpretations taken too many different ways and hidden meanings discovered religion became a tool for the weak to control the strong with all these new morals and ethics survival of the fittest was gone no longer could the biggest man simply take whatever he needed cause damnation was the price if certain rules were not heeded some of the deeds committed in my name just made me wonder where i went wrong back at the start when i created this the foundation seemed so strong see all the elements were already here long before i began i just kind of put it all together i didn t really think out a long term plan i made the sun an appropriate distance and laid the stars across the sky so you could navigate the globe or simply watch a sun rise i covered the earth with plants and fruits some for sustenance and some for beauty i made the sun shine and the clouds rain so their maintenance wasn t your duty i tried to give each creature its own attributes without making them enveloped i gave you all you all your own space to grow and in your own way space to develop i didn t know such development would cause rifts and jealousy cause you to war against each other and leave marks on this planet indelibly you see i wasn t really the creator i was more the curator of nature and i want to set things straight with homosexuals right now i don t hate ya i was a simple being that happened to be the first to yield such powers i just laid the ground it was you that built the towers it was you that invented bombs and the fear that comes with them and it was you that invented money and the corrupt economic systems you invented terms like just war and terms like friendly fire and it was you that didn t know when to stop digging deeper when to stop building higher it was you that exhausted the resources i carefully laid out on this earth and it was you that even saw these problems coming but accredited them little worth it was you that used my teachings for your own personal gain and it was you that committed such tragedies even if they were in my name so i apologize for any mistakes i made and when my words were misconstrued but this apology s to mother nature cause i created you everything is broken everyone is everything everyone1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there once was a song called arrest the president contemporary music a hit with the kids it was a top ten i wasn t pop then so i missed the bus a bit but

place glew in the dark you could see right across the river from the cutty sark to milwall park we shared a kiss at that moment with no sexual undercurrents she jumped to her feet and said lets play a game if you can catch me right now i will tell you my name and with that she turned and ran as i promptly gave chase through streets and alleyways as laughs cascaded from her face and again i have no doubt it was down to the chemicals but she seemed to float and glow as we bounded on like thin blood through white ventricles all of a sudden like in slow motion she hurled herself into the air and then in the blinking sound of a splash i was stood all alone there there was no flailing or splashes just the first one that broke the surface i heard that when a girl writes off the world its done in

handle and used it stood before me was the physical embodiment of music i could barely believe my eyes she was a sepia goddess every contour was perfection and her demeanour was modest even armed with all this beauty she was in no way belittling i d liken her body to the opening riff from little wing her eyes burned deep with the passion of a nameless chain gang and lips smart with the vibe of son of a preacher man she told me she had evolved over time we sauntered into her room room with just a bed and some wine we talked for hours about the things she s seen and done but not boasting we passed the zinfandel raised the glass and just toasting we had a meeting of minds she breathed life in this old brain she was the milk in my kahla i was the hartman to her coltrane showed me scars she had acquired each time a genius would depart jimi hendrix on her left hand johnny cash on her heart different fingers mingus davis and her leg scarred for elvis ray charles on her eyelids jim morrison on her pelvis then she asked about me and my musical stylings all the things in life i found somewhat inspiring i paused the wine making me feel quite cocky feeling whatever i said she would take in and not mock me i said i m a wordsmith and artist i m deep like the tardis every time i aim for something i m gonna hit the target she joked gangster rap i said no but drop the g you might start to get a better description of me angster rap she said if it sticks you ll regret that the most appalling moniker since the dawn of dan le sac she was a sepia goddess yeah her demeanour was modest her

this equation a little top heavy if you know what i mean cause there s a fine line between a classic and a has been as i finished that sentence i noticed the sadness in her eyes this moved me left my mind wondering why as we lay there she buried her head in my chest i wrapped my arms around her stroked her with the sweetest caress i wanted to find the right line that could make her sad head lift wanted a chance to breathe life back into music like redshift said she d grown sick and tired of the same shit i said if there was anything in the world i could do she should name it she said sit in public places and quietly observe all of the speeches mannerisms every action and word when something inspires me to concentrate on that thing get a pen and pad and then produce a vocal offering she

in half but this ain t magic in fact it s something far more dark or more dramatic self harm that s what they call it cause it just affects you it s your life your body so you can choose what you do and if one day you can t reign it in and of your last breath you are the only witness then so be it cause it s your last breath and it s nobody else s business but how about your little sister i mean you think your life s been bad and by no means am i belittling that cause i know the troubles you ve had but a teen finding out her big sister chose death over life finding out instead of turning to her with your problems you turned to a knife that s a whole lot of pain to deal with and a whole lot of damage and the only role model she has now is little more than words engraved in granite but as you said before this just affects you it s your life your body so you can choose what you do and if one day you can t reign it in and of your last breath you are the only witness then so be it cause it s your last breath and it s nobody else s business but then how about your parents god knows they ve done all they can to support yeah you didn t grow up in a mansion but they gave you the best life they could afford and the second that last bit of life trickles out and your lungs cease to breath they ve failed the most important task that they will ever receive they failed to give their child a life that s worth living and that s a failure as long as they live of themselves is unforgiving but as you said before this just affects you it s your life your body so you can choose what you do and if one day you can t rein it in and of your last breath you are the only witness then so be it cause it s your last breath and it s nobody else s business but how about your friends how did they fail to see this coming i mean you can only hold so much pain and recently it seems like the tap s been left running families grow distant but it s meant to be your friends you can rely on they shouldn t be there for just fun and drinks they should be the shoulder to cry on they should be the ones you turn to when you can t talk to your family but they failed to because although you didn t ask for their support it should have been mandatory but as you said before this just affects you it s your life your body so you can choose what you do and if one day you can t rein it in and of your last breath you are the only witness then so be it cause it s your last breath and it s nobody else s business but then what about me what kind of boyfriend am i instead of living a life i was a big part of you would rather die instead of fighting though together and turning things around you decided the grass is greener on the other side of the ground of our shared lives there was nothing worth living for as far as you could see so if that s the case for you then what is there left in this life for me but as you said before this just affects you it s your life your body your sister your parents your friends and your partner so you can choose what you do and if one day you can t rein it in and of your last breath you are the only witness then fuck everybody else cause that ain t

above all of these tiresome things that we know and love waiting for the beat to kick in but it never does a lot of my poems and writings seem to start with me waking up or being in a dream or dream like state now this implies a certain level of abstraction in my work you might say i m keeping it surreal but i d rather you didn t fact is i sleep a lot it s as simple as that i like sleeping man it s a nice place to be right i was walking along through unfamiliar streets and it felt strange because there didn t seem to be anyone else around i don t know where i was but it had a feeling of new york but not new york in real life the new york you see in old films i can t really explain why it just had that vibe every step i took felt somehow more dramatic so i kept walking and down an alley behind a bar sitting on some metal steps i saw a man from the look and smell of him it was clear that he enjoyed the drink but he wasn t in such a state i felt him to be any kind of irrational threat so i approached him with due care ah mr pip he said out loud we ve been awaiting you my name is elwood p dowd now just what he meant by we i didn t really get but all the same i took a seat next to him on the step he said you ll meet a few people before this day is through who will administer advice and guidelines to you now what each of them says i ll tell you now is true but whether or not you take their advice is for you to choose at that point he acted as if someone had whispered in his ear which since no one else was there was pretty damn weird awkwardly i looked away and kinda played with my beard and he cleared his throat for a second and said listen here in this life you can be oh so smart or oh so pleasant for years i was smart i recommend pleasant being smart can make you rich and bring respect and reverence but the rewards of being pleasant are far more incandescent with this information i was encouraged to walk on i continued alone through these empty streets thinking over what elwood had said but at the same time thinking about how fucking strange the day had been so far i was in my own little world when a hand was placed on my chest and a guy said look out there s some broken glass on the floor there i looked up he said hi pleased to meet you my name is lloyd dobler i ll get straight to the point won t take too much time from ya i m probably the youngest person you ll get advice from today and you may think that a guy my age wouldn t have anything to say but it s said that observation not old age brings wisdom and i observe every single life lesson i m given i won t attempt tell you how to love or be loved because you get a different genie each time that lantern is rubbed but i will offer you advice on dealing with life its ups and its downs its troubles and its strife now i m sure you ve had times when you ve felt down or angry wanted to lash out punch a wall and be manly but the question i pose now will offer you a plan b and maybe some peace and quiet for your friends and family how hard is it to decide to be in a good mood and then just be in a good mood that s all i have to say because it s a straight up fact you control your emotions it s as simple as that he walked off then leaving me to contemplate this brief encounter i barely had time to realize i was being taught something before he was gone and i was back on my way on i walked and almost immediately i spotted the next guide and it couldn t be clearer this guy was standing on the street corner and pacing back and forth skinny looking guy leather jacket tight jeans retro look i d rarely seen someone look quite so uncomfortable in their own skin twitching smoothing his hair back kicking the floor and looking up and down the street he clearly didn t enjoy waiting around so i approached him quickly to put him out of his misery and to let him start his spiel hi my name is billy brown i ain t gonna give you some quote instead i m gonna use some stuff that you wrote always had the feeling i could never be the villain cause the villain in the films is always backlit always had the feeling i could never be the villain cause the villain in the films is always backlit now i find it pleasing to defend myself with reason but this clock is always sitting on my back tick tick tick then no explosion but persistence brings erosion like a picture over overly exposed and like a fox that s been run over in the road and basically what i m trying to say to you is you don t achieve anything by letting the past dwell within you getting all pent up and angry about stuff just eats away inside you what s that other line of yours if you can t forgive and forget how s this forget forgiving and just accept that that s it see that s how it s got to be then you can fall in love get on with your life and be free almost before he could finished this sentence he was off down the street hands in his pockets hurrying away now quite accepting of the totally surreal time i was having i rounded the corner and continued on to my next encounter resigned to the fact this was some dream or hallucination i made my way through the now dark street to the one window that had a light on i walked through the unlocked door which incidentally had blinds down and a silhouetted figure like a film noir scene but sadly no sign saying private eye as i entered a voice promptly said this journey s almost over i m the only one left allow me to introduce myself my name is walter neff the other guys have taught you things of great positive worth but i m afraid i m here to bring you back down to earth see you can live your life in control and be nice but even that will not promise you a happy life you may think yourself in general to be a nice guy but i m telling you now that right there is a lie even the nicest of guys has some nasty within them you don t have to be backlit to be the villain whether it be greed lust or just plain vindictiveness there s a level of malevolence inside all of us you can paint yourself an image and live in your own little dream but this ain t a dream it s one big silver screen so when you think you ve got your happy ending don t ever forget it it ain t over til you hear the sound of your end credits you ll be waiting for the beat to kick in but it never does waiting for you feet to grow wings that lift you above all of these tiresome things that you know and love waiting for the beat to kick in but it never does waiting for the beat to kick in but it never does waiting for you feet to grow wings that lift you

unconsidered i d rather love at first fight and then onto double figures an unconditional love well that just means nothing in love with the mere idea of loving something always just hunting for that near life experience in fear of missing something vital from your own existence all your emotions subconsciously thought out and scripted less about how you re feeling more about how you fucking depict it but all that stops when one day you just decide to stop playing along that point in time when the most amazing things in the world can just as easily seem pedestrian you ve lost both that loving and that loathing feeling turns out hell does have a bottom and heaven a ceiling both love and hate become opaque in time s wake a face that once summons rage now summons nothing whether it s emotions tethered nerve endings severed or just the outlook you acquire when you re a little more weathered remaining conscious of this all and in a way feeling above it still feels like bad riddance

and get lost completely so he saved all his money one goal in mind to go down to a performance and see this live it took eight long months to raise these funds but the excitement was immense when that day did come with his pockets full of coins he got the bus to the city he watched the view become less shitty and gritty even though he was alone in this big dark place nothing could remove the smile from his face when he arrived everyone was in suits sammy stood there in tatty jeans and boots he slammed his coins on the counter one ticket please but the guy turned up his nose like he was gonna sneeze he looked away and served the next couple suited and booted but sammy stood his ground and asked again less muted they laughed and someone sneered get out of here pikey appreciation on your

i couldnt change whats behind me i hid inside my shell from the world out of sight tucked away so that no one could see once again i feel all of the pain rise inside rushing back to me like an unstoppable tide i dont need the warmth and no i dont need the pain im fine without this thing called love i wish to numb my heart to numb my heart against the pain and take it away so i can overcome the dark just like a shooting star in the sky into the deep i sink nearing the brink my heart and soul succumb to the fall i try to scream but theres no sound so i accept i wont be found but then i hear your voice calling im no longer falling but rising up as you pull me to the light the world i knew once quiet and grey began to change when you looked my way i thought sure my heart wouldnt heal but i guess you have made the impossible real look me in the eyes and make my heart skip a beat fill my world with color and set my spirit free i was never falling i was swept off my feet the very moment you reached me i wish to numb my heart to numb my heart and find the strength to heal whats inside so i can overcome the dark just like a shooting star in the sky  into the deep i sink nearing the brink but now i know youre there if i fall ill show the darkness i can fight and when im lost youll be the light so now theres no hesitating im tired of waiting to turn the page and to find out whats to come i always treasure our time together these golden memories when i was falling and you were calling i heard a knock on the door through all the pain ive overcome ill take a step out of my shell ive waited all this time to turn the page and now ill finally blink away what held me back in the past i swear i wish to numb my heart to numb my heart against the pain and take it away so i can overcome the dark just like a shooting star in the sky this oath will never die my tears have dried ill never let my life slip on by because i know theres more than this and if i only have one wish i pray the chapter that follows will lead to tomorrow so i will see what the future holds for me1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"well wood burns and metal rusts so darling whats to become of us when the
