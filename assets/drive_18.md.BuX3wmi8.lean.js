played waltzing matilda as the ship pulled away from the quay and amidst all the cheers the flag waving and tears we sailed off for gallipoli and how well i remember that terrible day how our blood stained the sand and the water and of how in that hell that they called suvla bay we were butchered like lambs at the slaughter johnny turk he was waiting he d primed himself well he showered us with bullets and he rained us with shell and in five minutes flat he d blown us all straight to hell nearly blew us right back to australia but the band played waltzing matilda when we stopped to bury our slain we buried ours and the turks buried theirs then we started all over again and those that were left well we tried to survive in that mad world of blood death and fire and for ten weary weeks i kept myself alive though around me the corpses piled higher then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over head and when i woke up in my hospital bed and saw what it had done well i wished i was dead never knew there was worse things than dyin for i ll go no more waltzing matilda all around the green bush far and free to hang tent and pegs a man needs both legs no more waltzing matilda for me so they gathered the crippled the wounded the maimed and they shipped us back home to australia the legless the armless the blind the insane those proud wounded heroes of suvla and as our ship pulled into circular quay i looked at the place where me legs used to be and thanked christ there was nobody waiting for me to grieve to mourn and to pity but the band played waltzing matilda as they carried us down the gangway but nobody cheered they just stood and stared then they turned all their faces away and so now every april i sit on me porch and i watch the parades pass before me and i see my old comrades how proudly they march reviving old dreams of past glories and the old men march slowly old bones stiff and sore the forgotten heroes of a forgotten war and the young people ask what are they marching for and i ask myself the same question but the band plays waltzing matilda and the old men still answer the call but as year follows year more old men disappear someday no one will march

postcard stamped with no address i just hope it gets to where its got to go and beats the cold stress cuz those who can t take it go west coast on the search for gold let see how far you get before your progress slows and the california dream gets old and overrated its where mediocre artists go to settle for less as broke waiters they travel in packs like chain smokers with the hopes of being famous but can t make it on their own i seen their bandwagon pass me by while i was dragging my boycott pulling my own weight in stride it was my choice not to ask for a ride cuz one at a time i d come across those who ve fallen off and careers died on the side of the road like no one noticed or thought twice that you were covered in snow and frost bite oh the irony when karma catches up taste your own medicine means just see where you end up where the fuck are they now as time passed they re miles back in piles and all i do is smile and laugh cuz once it hits november its just another winter don t think i won t remember who should get the middle finger cuz i ve gone this far and i ve counted these days with my soul on this postcard and it found its way through the bullshit and politics in and out of this from the bottom up i finished what i started survived another winter some heads go blind every time the sun sets feeling the chill of sudden death they up and run for the west while we survive these winters of disconnect thrive whither and die with the sun surrender to death then resurrect with fire on our tongues and thicker blood stubborn as the earth waiting for the blizzard to come its just a mystery to some who feel the cold tell their bones to lay down afraid to stay around they re hopping planes trains and greyhounds l a bound the days are shades of gray now stay in and pull the shades down the rain will flood the gutters and slush will suck at our boots winter is the curse we shuffle through huddled in groups growing indestructible roots and hold mics like they re frozen i hope the plates don t shift and drop your fragile state into the ocean new england patriots its in our nature to resist that s what the fuck we re known for eyes forward til the cold war is over survived another winter  by pinning myself to the frozen ground this time syncopated to the sound of falling snow with this rhyme the constant sunshine of the west made me lose track eyes toward where the sun rises so i decided to move back because i d rather fill my lungs with chimney smoke as opposed to california smog that always seemed to make me choke yeah yeah the silence of falling snow enough to make you deaf give me overcast days and snow drifts i wanna watch my breath float away into the sky season change two words that i need to live my life by ask why jack frost is my friend again then pretend that in a couple of months i won t be climbing up these walls again but i ll invite the cabin fever in with open arms nothing else to do but sit and write and set alarms snowed in writing new raps watching snow fall out the studio window is how i survived another winter when the look alikes insisted that i go west i didn t book a flight i shook my right fist full of protest i slipped right into the snow vest respect the dress code we see our own breath when it gets cold the heart rates get slow every move is purposeful the crowd stands with their arms crossed boss don t take it personal it s gray skies white lies and black ice when the day dies the night time s my afterlife i made my sacrifice i m not confined to this island drifter time shifter get the troubles off your mind sister don t be sensitive slip inside a hide that s thicker sure hide your figure survive a winter wonderland and understand that sometimes we shiver to stay alive we don t follow the signs of a quitter he s talking with his mouth full looking like his eyes were bigger than his stomach but fuck it because shuckin and jivin just does damage to the inside like liquor inside your liver slap me with a parental advisory sticker you want constant sunshine that s a side splitter got no time for punchlines that s why i m bitter frostbite sarcasm sealed signed and

all wondered amongst themselves what i would do next after all that i d found in my travels around the world was there anything left gentlemen i said i ve studied the maps and if what i m thinking is

my guts and my god then i paused and the annabelle lee oh the annabelle lee i saw their eyes shine the most beautiful ship in the sea my nina my pinta my santa maria my beautiful annabelle lee that spring i set sail as the crowd waved from shore and on board the crew waved their hands but i never had family just the annabelle lee so i d never had cause to look back i just set the course north and i studied the charts and towards dark i drifted toward sleep and i dreamed of the fine deep harbor i d find past the ice for my annabelle lee after that it got colder and the world got quiet it was never quite day or quite night and the sea turned the color of sky turned the color of sea turned the color of ice til at last all around us was fastness one vast glassy desert of arsenic white and the waves that once lifted us sifted instead into drifts against annabelle s sides and the crew gathered closer at first for the comfort but each morning would bring a new set of the tracks in the snow leading over the edge of the world til i was the only one left and after that it gets cloudy but it feels like i laid there for days and maybe for months but annabelle held me the two of us happy just to think back on all we had done we talked of the other worlds we d discover as she gave up her body to me and as i chopped up her mainsail for timber i told her of all that we still had to see and as the frost turned her moorings to ninetail and the wind lashed her sides in the cold i burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold i won t call it rescue what brought me here back to the old world to drink and decline and pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine but sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of

images some come on you had your moment now it s george s turn it s george s turn i wasn t talking turns i m talking art don t you think he s original well yes you re talking crap but is it really new well no his own collaborator it s more than novelty well yes it s just impersonal but it s all promotion but that is the state of the art isn t it well art isn t easy even when you ve amassed it fighting for prizes no one can be an oracle art isn t easy suddenly you re past it all compromises and then when it s allegorical art isn t easy art isn t easy art isn t easy any way you look at it here s george now all right george as long as it s your night george you know what s in the room george another chromolume george it s time to get to work george i want you to meet one of our board

up on the trapeze george machines don t grow on trees george start putting it together this is the third piece of yours i ve seen they are getting so large art isn t easy even when you re hot are these inventions of yours one of a kind advancing art is easy yes financing it is not a vision s just a vision if it s only in your head if no one gets to see it it s as good as dead it has to come to light i put the names of my contributors on the side of each machine how clever bit by bit putting it together piece by piece only way to make a work of art every moment makes a contribution every little detail plays a part having just the vision s no solution everything depends on execution putting it together that s what counts the board of the foundation is meeting next week ounce by ounce putting it together you ll come to lunch small amounts adding up to make a work of art first of all you need a good foundation otherwise it s risky from the start takes a little cocktail conversation but without the proper preparation having just the vision s no solution everything depends on execution the art of making art is putting it together bit by bit oh we haven t met charles redmond county museum of texas i wanted you to know we re in the process of giving out some sizable commissions link by link making the connections i hope you don t mind my bringing up business during a social occasion drink by drink fixing and perfecting the design adding just a dab of politician lining up the funds but in addition lining up a prominent commission otherwise your perfect composition isn t going to get much exhibition art isn t easy every minor detail is a major decision have to keep things in scale have to hold to your vision every time i start to feel defensive i remember lasers are expensive what s a little cocktail conversation if it s going to get you your foundation leading to a prominent commission and an exhibition in addition art isn t easy trying to make connections who understands it difficult to evaluate art isn t easy trying to form collections always in transit and then when you have to collaborate art isn t easy any way you look at it george hello lee randolph i handle the public relations for the museum dot by dot building up the image there s a lot of opportunity for some fine press here shot by shot keeping at a distance doesn t pay still if you remember your objective not give all your privacy away a little bit of hype can be effective long as you can keep it in perspective after all without some recognition no one s going to give you a commission art isn t easy overnight you re a trend you re the right combination then the trend s at an end you re suddenly last year s sensation if you feel a sense of coalition then you never really stand alone if you want your work to reach fruition what you need s a link with your tradition and of course a prominent commission plus a little formal recognition so that you can go on exhibit so that your work can go on exhibition there s the man of the hour blair hello i read your piece on neo expressionism good for you well what did you think george chromolume number seven be nice george i was hoping it would be a series of threefour at the most you have to pay a price george i ve touted your work from the beginning you know that they like to give advice george you were really onto something with these light machinesonce don t think about it twice george now they re just becoming more and more about less and less i disagree now don t get me wrong you re a talented guy but i think you re capable of far more be new george they tell you till they re blue george not that you couldn t succeed by doing chromolume after chromolumebut there are new discoveries to be made george you re new or else you re through george and even if it s true george you do what you can do bit by bit putting it together piece by piece working out the vision night and day all it takes is time and perseverance with a little luck along the way putting in a personal appearance gathering supporters and adherents but he combines all these different trends mapping out the right configuration starting with a suitable foundation he s an original was lining up a prominent commission and an exhibition in addition here a little dab of politician i like those images there a little touch of publication some they re just his personal response to what the painting till you have a balanced composition bullshit anyway the painting s overrated it s only new though for now overrated it s a masterpiece everything depends on preparation nouveau a masterpiece historically important maybe and yesterday s forgotten oh now you re judging seurat are you even if you do have the suspicion all it is is pleasant just like george s work it s just your jealousy of george s work you can t divide art today and you can t tell good from rotten and no nuance no resonance no relevance there s nuance and there s resonance there s relevance that it s taking all your concentration i m not surprised most art today today it s all a matter of promotion there s not much point in arguing go with it no point in arguing is a matter of promotion but then the art of making art besides it s all promotion but then you say it s all promotion but then what will they think of next that is the state of the art is

might have moved him in the night and none of us knows where the stone s been rolled away and now his body isn t there we both ran toward the garden then john ran on ahead we found the stone and empty

just what i did not know john believed a miracle but i just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldn t lift me very high cause i d seen them crucify him then i saw him die back inside the

streetlamp gutters and soon it will be morning daylight i must wait for the sunrise i must think of a new life and i mustn t give in when the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too and a new day will begin  burnt out ends of smokey days the stale cold smell of morning the street lamp dies another night is over another day is dawning sunlight through the trees in summer endless masquerading like a

best to be both but lets be honest a father really helps with your growth but i was raised by nas and jay z and big l and eminem all of them set examples through they listen close so i could hear it about life and how not to fear it how to grab the wheel and steer it and so i and so i did just that word of advice follow your dreams and never look back i said its logic is it real is it fake i woke
