of the dream a fear of heart and all of its turnings and it s never letting go i m sure i ll sleep when all this goes under but now will i sleep alone it only starts with a river but i know it s only waiting for the golden ground it s wide and awake but i m showing up late on the way there was something that told me to stay i feed on the sunlight but sunlight just drives me away in the loving game the summer is deep and the memories still the garden is full and i m way over hills i see there s a line that i m walking and i m just the same it s an endless game in the darkness of the

hold your body down your shaking seems to hinder every grasp that i have found moving every inch around you to defuse your private bomb i stretch myself surrounding and protecting you from harm i use a wallet for your mouth so when you bite you will not bleed i drilled a wire through my cheek and let it down and out my sleeve and now you re pulling out the best of me yeah which never ever comes this wire s all that s left of me and it s hooked within my gums within my gums so drill it so drill it so hard i feel it so drill it so drill it so hard i feel it as proof to show i d bleed for this i d cut myself to shame to get to know this masochist who s stolen my first name pretending he s a teacher holding all my weight at ease but the teacher seems to split in two destroying both his knees now crawling i position myself below your broken wings i lift your feathered left arm where you hide your heart from me i never noticed it was swollen with the touch of brutal pain i never knew a heart could live inside the rust from all your rain all your rain  so drill it so drill it so hard i feel it so drill it so drill it so hard i feel it i didn t think to bring a washcloth or to rub away the dirt myself and i we share this barely beating heart of hurt and when the hurt comes there s an argument a fight to save a smile a small attack on human tears to dry them for a while a dream we all should count on yeah a vision i believe in where confidence is found attached to wires on our sleeve and where loneliness is history told to pack his shit and leave and where guidance is a fortune told to help in time of need and where crying isn t secret it s the art of how we grieve and lessons are the key to every goal i will achieve i will achieve so drill it so drill it so hard i

cause i wear this silly grin the moment you come into view chances are you think that i m in love with you woah woah oh oh woah woah woah woah oh oh why do we do this to ourselves we do this over and over and over and over again round and round we go ah we re all just going round in circles if 1 equals 1 then how come so much that it hurts you the worst truth is the fact that this is all actually self inflicted you ve only got yourself to blame if the whole thing ends in stitches still we ride on and let bygones be bygones cause all we all we want is lo o ove and we chase it like rat race for the papers so a man stands for his baby it s a grand slam for the ages i woke in love again who would have thought of heartbroken and it would come again fuck it then might as well get a bun in the oven then dont be selfish it s not like this planets overcrowded or that people should adopt more or clocked that recreation should all stop for a second we ve got babies having babies for their child support whatre we doing are we acting as we should are we being proper humans if love s the most powerful energy that exists how come it only lasts a bit and then afterwards feels like shit we sit there and tell ourselves nope never again love s not for me i m going celibate friends and all it bloody takes is a half decent conversation with the opposite sex and you re back on the act of mating never forsaken always the top of contemplation but who can blame us the whole globe runs off fornication sex sells so why are we not all millionaires i mean someone s making money but no one seems to care three quarters still asleep living life within a dream and working hard for 50 weeks and spending two to think in peace we re all trapped up in the circle of love once found it s then lost cause one felt it wasn t enough  chances are cause i wear this silly grin the moment you come into view chances are you think that i m in love with you ah this is all just meant to be a vicious circle of wishful purposed energy and eventually we come to the concluded rest in peace that love is more about pain than it seems it s crazy how we do it i mean love is all there really is about us humans we love each other spiritually consciously coexist but that same love of ego s left society where it is so the question is can we truly love or will love ironically be the end of us soon enough true love does exist i believe to my gut it just takes two souls to make it to take it through the rough but fuck i mean easier said than done because paranoia s a bitch and jealousy s a cunt and how we think we re ready to share love with someone else when we can t even love this planet let alone ourselves it s like we should take our hearts and put it on a shelf and just leave that there for you and nobody else but of course the opposite sex can love each other we ve got fathers brothers sons daughters sisters and mothers but husbands and wives well that normally ends in troubles sweet honeymoon period then pop goes your bubble you can stay together and in love just like some do but ask those that arent and they ll tell you it s a struggle so are we all destined for cursed marriage or is it that nothing comes easy that s worth having it s up to you what you do with love once you ve found it you can feed it from your soul or let your ego drown it i stand astounded have i clocked it here in this rhyme love s only relevant to an actual period of time i sit back and smile through my crooked teeth i m done looking for love i m gonna let love come look for me chances are cause i wear this

sand like a storm that ll break any second there s a hunger in the land there s a reckoning still to be reckoned and we re gonna be free someday at the end of the day i dreamed a dream in times gone by when hope was high and life worth living i dreamed that hope would never die i dreamed that god would be forgiving then i was young and unafraid and dreams were made and used and wasted there was no ransom to be paid no song unsung no wine untasted who am i can i condemn these men to slavery pretend i do not feel their agony these innocent who bear my face who go to judgement in my place who am i can i conceal myself for evermore pretend i m not the man i was before and must my name until i die be no more than an alibi must i lie how can i ever face my fellow men how can i ever face myself again my soul belongs to god i know i made that bargain long ago he gave me hope when hope was gone he gave me strength to journey on watch em run amuck catch em as they fall never know your luck till there s a free for all here s a little nip there s a little touch most of them are goners so they won t miss much one day to a new beginning every man will be a king there s a new world for the winning do you hear the people sing tomorrow we ll be far away tomorrow is the judgement day tomorrow we ll discover what our god in heaven has in store one more dawn one more day one day more do you hear the people sing singing the song of angry men it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again for the wretched of the earth there is a flame that never dies even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise they will live again in freedom in the garden of the lord they will walk behind the ploughshed the will put away the sword the chain will be broken and all men will have their reward will you join in our crusade who will be strong and stand with me somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see do you hear the people sing say do you hear the distant drums it is the future that they bring when tomorrow comes will you join in our crusade who will be strong and stand with me somewhere beyond the barricade is there a world you long to see do you hear
