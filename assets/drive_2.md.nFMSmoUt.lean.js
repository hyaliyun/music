so go ahead rip up your will because he s the terminator dead body cremator intimating thugs who thought their cuts were greater he s the father of soul committing you to his goal with kurtis blow by his side i will roll and when it comes to rap you better pay your respect cause i m a project some call me al capone of eighties romeo of ladies interpretates obfuscated rhymes to babies expand the minds of young through books from libraries and teachin them actual facts don t ask me to produce it i refuse to induce it and knowledge of my rhymes said when you don t use it lock all of my triggers are cocked and if you make the wrong move consider your street rocked they held a gun to our head till we were moved to the top and you got shot i can t take it no more i m not going for short because

you laughed when i chose the mic go ahead and sharpen your blade while i plug in the cord goddamn i proved the tongue is mightier than the sword man your game is through and your goose is cooked cause i can read your mind it s like a open book and your every move is in my control and you know i m the winner deep down in your soul but you wanna play stubborn that s why i m pissed and now it s time for your face to get dissed you held me down for too long now i m calling your bluff streets need to be rocked they need to be rocked tough streets have called my name for years but now that i m found here is the ultimate chain to the hip hop sound the duplicated complicated arranged so i can state it the modern day technology computer isolate it just me and bill black cold rockin the street and pulling up the ground with the ultimate beat you better not stand still get a move to that butt don t need to spin on your head do a casual strut go move your body to a sound down with the bass drum you can hear for miles around we got our rap down pat and the beat by black a little scratchin on the side with a fresh handclap turn the volume up loud put the push in the bass guarantee we re gonna turn out the place but if still seems like you can t party and your feet won t jump but you don t know how to dance to any kind of junk your body moves side to side then front to back that s the way your body moves to a beat by black cause it s the rhythm that he s given you gotta go with him regardless of your race creed color or religion come on join in the fun i want you all to get some just as long as you can keep up with the pace of the drum the funky fresh will make you feel it no longer we conceal it the beat has been on hold too long and now we must reveal it don t stand in our way

life you hang on street corners juggle reputation and game when you re dead or in jail there s no one that you can blame because you re the instigator family separator your friends don t even wanna be bothered cause you re a traitor but i m not tryna talk you off of that street corner cause a man won t do what a man don t wanna but summer s around i think you better beware of a happening that occurs this time of the year it s a thumpin that beats deep down in your heart it s a craving that can even rip your soul apart and it s the urge that raves throughout the street make everyone jump wild and lose control of their feet something that beams through the rain through the sun and the sky it s microscopic it cannot be seen by your naked eye unconscious thought taking control of your body now you ought to be jumpin at a jam packed party with your big butt shakin i know it shows you lose control of your head arms legs and your toes you got your beatbox blastin and now you re in

miles behind so no matter where i am i have a brilliant time if you don t believe me hold on and i ll fix you a line just take one sniff of this and you ll be out of your mind but i took the coke and

yogi psychic breathing with the exception of the instructions in the yogi rhythmic breathing the majority of the exercises heretofore given in this book relate to the physical plane of effort which while highly important in itself is also regarded by the yogis as in the nature of affording a substantial basis for efforts on the psychic and spiritual plane do not however discard or think lightly of the physical phase of the subject for remember that it needs a sound body to support a sound mind and also that the body is the temple of the ego the lamp in which burns the light of the spirit everything is good in its place and everything has its place the developed man is the all around man who recognizes body mind and spirit and renders to each its due neglect of either is a mistake which must be rectified sooner or later a debt which must be repaid with interest we will now take up the psychic phase of the yogi science of breath in the shape of a series of exercises each exercise carrying with it its explanation you will notice that in each exercise rhythmic breathing is accompanied with the instructions to carry the thought of certain desired results this mental attitude gives the will a cleared track upon which to exercise its force we cannot in this work go into the subject of the power of the will and must assume that you have some knowledge of the subject if you have no acquaintance with the subject you will find that the actual practice of the exercises themselves will give you a much clearer knowledge than any amount of theoretical teaching for as the old hindu proverb says he who tastes a grain of mustard seed knows more of its flavor than he who sees an elephant load of it general directions for yogi psychic breathing the basis of all yogi psychic breathing is the yogi rhythmic breath instruction regarding which we gave in our last chapter in the following exercises in order to avoid useless repetition we will say merely breath rhythmically and then give the instruction for the exercise of the psychic force or directed will power working in connection with the rhythmic breath vibrations after a little practice you will find that you will not need to count after the first rhythmic breath as the mind will grasp the idea of time and rhythm and you will be able to breathe rhythmically at pleasure almost automatically this will leave the mind clear for the sending of the psychic vibrations under the direction of the will prana distributing lying flat on the floor or bed completely relaxed with hands resting lightly over the solar plexus breathe rhythmically after the rhythm is fully established will that each inhalation will draw in an increased supply of prana or vital energy from the universal supply which will be taken up by the nervous system and stored in the solar plexus at each exhalation will that the prana or vital energy is being distributed all over the body to every organ and part to every muscle cell and atom to nerve artery and vein from top of your head to the soles of your feet invigorating strengthening and stimulating every nerve recharging every nerve center sending energy force and strength all over the system while exercising the will try to form a mental picture of the inrushing prana coming in through the lungs and being taken up at once by the solar plexus then with exhaling effort being sent to all parts of the system down to the finger tips and down to the toes it is not necessary to use the will with an effort simply commanding that which you wish to produce and then making the mental picture of it is all that is necessary calm command with the mental picture is far better than forcible willing which only dissipates force needlessly the above exercise is most helpful and greatly refreshes and strengthens the nervous system and produces a restful feeling all over the body it is especially beneficial in cases where one is tired or feels a lack of energy inhibiting pain lying down or sitting erect breath rhythmically holding the thought that you are inhaling prana then when you exhale send the prana to the painful part to re establish the circulation and nerve current then inhale more prana for the purpose of driving out the painful condition then exhale holding the thought that you are driving out the pain alternate the two above mental commands and with one exhalation stimulate the part and with the next drive out the pain keep this up for seven breaths then practice the cleansing breath and rest a while then try it again until relief comes which will be before long many pains will be found to be relieved before seven breaths are finished if the hand is placed over the painful part you may get quicker results send the current of prana down the arm and into the painful part directing the circulation lying down or sitting erect breathe rhythmically and with the exhalations direct the circulation to any part you wish which may be suffering from imperfect circulation this is effective in cases of cold feet or in cases of headache the blood being sent downward in both cases in the first case warming the feet and in the latter relieving the brain from too great pressure in the case of headache try the pain inhibiting first then follow with sending the blood downward you will often feel a warm feeling in the legs as the circulation moves downward the circulation is largely under the control of the will and rhythmic breathing renders the task easier self healing lying in a relaxed condition breathe rhythmically and command that a good supply of prana be inhaled with the exhalation send the prana to the affected part for the purpose of stimulating it vary this occasionally by exhaling with the mental command that the diseased condition be forced out and disappear use the hands in this exercise passing them down the body from the head to the affected part in using the hands in healing yourself or others always hold the mental image that the prana is flowing down the arm and through the finger tips into the body thus reaching the affected part and healing it of course we can give only general directions in this book without taking up the several forms of disease in detail but a little practice of the above exercise varying it slightly to fit the conditions of the case will produce wonderful results some yogis follow the plan of placing both hands on the affected part and then breathing rhythmically holding the mental image that they are fairly pumping prana into the diseased organ and part stimulating it and driving out diseased conditions as pumping into a pail of dirty water will drive out the latter and fill the bucket with fresh water this last plan is very effective if the mental image of the pump is clearly held the inhalation representing the lifting of the pump handle and the exhalation the actual pumping healing others we cannot take up the question of the psychic treatment of disease by prana in detail in this book as such would be foreign to its purpose but we can and will give you simple plain instructions whereby you may be enabled to do much good in relieving others the main principle to remember is that by rhythmic breathing and controlled thought you are enabled to absorb a considerable amount of prana and are also able to pass it into the body of another person stimulating weakened parts and organs and imparting health and driving out diseased conditions you must first learn to form such a clear mental image of the desired condition that you will be able to actually feel the influx of prana and the force running down your arms and out of your finger tips into the body of the patient breathe rhythmically a few times until the rhythm is fairly established then place your hands upon the affected part of the body of the patient letting them rest lightly over the part then follow the pumping process described in the preceding exercise and fill the patient full of prana until the diseased condition is driven out every once in a while raise the hands and flick the fingers as if you were throwing off the diseased condition it is well to do this occasionally and also to wash the hands after treatment as otherwise you may take on a trace of the diseased condition of the patient also practice the cleansing breath several times after the treatment during the treatment let the prana pour into the patient in one continuous stream allowing yourself to be merely the pumping machinery connecting the patient with the universal supply of prana and allowing it to flow freely through you you need not work the hands vigorously but simply enough that the prana freely reaches the affected parts the rhythmic breathing must be practiced frequently during the treatment so as to keep the rhythm normal and to afford the prana a free passage it is better to place the hands on the bare skin but where this is not advisable or possible place them over the clothing vary above methods occasionally during the treatment by stroking the body gently and softly with the finger tips the fingers being kept slightly separated this is very soothing to the patient in cases of long standing you may find it helpful to give the mental command in words such as get out get out or be strong be strong as the case may be the words helping you to exercise the will more forcibly and to the point vary these instructions to suit the needs of the case and use your own judgement and inventive faculty we have given you the general principles and you can apply them in hundreds of different ways the above apparently simple instruction if carefully studied and applied will enable one to accomplish all that the leading magnetic healers are able to although their systems are more or less cumbersome and complicated they are using prana ignorantly and calling it magnetism if they would combine rhythmic breathing with their magnetic treatment they would double their efficiency distant healing prana colored by the thought of the sender may be projected to persons at a distance who are willing to receive it and healing work done in this way this is the secret of the absent healing of which the western world has heard so much of late years the thought of the healer sends forth and colors the prana of the sender and it flashes across space and finds lodgment in the psychic mechanism of the patient it is unseen and like the marconi waves it passes through intervening obstacles and seeks the person attuned to receive it in order to treat persons at a distance you must form a mental image of them until you can feel yourself to be en rapport with them this is a psychic process dependent upon the mental imagery of the healer you can feel the sense of rapport when it is established it manifesting in a sense of nearness that is about as plain as we can describe it it may be acquired by a little practice and some will get it at the first trial when rapport is established say mentally to the distant patient i am sending you a supply of vital force or power which will invigorate you and heal you then picture the prana as leaving your mind with each exhalation of rhythmic breath and traveling across space instantaneously and reaching the patient and healing him it is not necessary to fix certain hours for treatment although you may do so if you wish the respective condition of the patient as he is expecting and opening himself up to your psychic force attunes him to receive your vibrations whenever you may send them if you agree upon hours let him place himself in a relaxed attitude and receptive condition the above is the great underlying principle of the absent treatment of the western world you may do these things as well as the most noted healers with a little practice","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"at my worst i m a terrorist of love at my best i m the king of compassion from a long line of doing it wrong i strike a

would never die i used to listen to awesome 2 on whbi i used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops rappers wore bell bottom lee suits me and kenny couldn t afford that so we would go to the park when they was jammin to hear rap i used to listen till the cops broke it up i always thought to myself damn why they fucked it up but nevertheless i was in love with the microphone and it stayed that way until i left home on the streets of new york now i m free but with freedom comes big responsibility i used to walk around driven by the force i remember how large super rhymes was when he fell off i used to wonder about crews that used to rock they were large but none of them could manage to stay on top do you ever think about when you outta here record deal and video outta here mercedes benz and range rover outta here no doubt bdp is old school but we ain t goin out  after livin on the streets alone some years went by i signed myself into a group home i used to watch the show i dream of jeannie and dreamt about when will i be large like whodini but i was messin with graffiti on the subway and gettin chased by the cops almost everyday i knew it had to be a better way see so i would go to my room blast run dmc around 1984 i left the group home again alone still dreamin about the microphone gimme a chance man i know i can rock it but i had to worry about puttin money in my pocket so when i reached the shelter i met my helper dj scott la rock and we both loved hip hop i was takin suckas out in the shelter system yeah there was rappers in the shelter but i had to diss em but all along my vision was never lost i kept seeing all these rap groups fallin off do you ever think about when you re outta here fly girl and fresh gear outta here five thousand dollar love seat outta here no doubt bdp is old school but we ain t goin out while i m battling these rival crews yes bdp would stay in the street news some said all they wanna do is battle they can t write a song so their careers won t last long around this time i used to hang with ced gee and dj scott la rock used to buy gold with eric b i didn t meet rakim till later with scott i remember we were jammin at the rooftop it used to irk me when these critics had opinions scott would say just keep rappin i ll keep spinnin we had a fucked up contract but we signed it and dropped the hip hop album criminal minded we told the critics your opinions are bull same time eric b and rakim dropped paid in full hip hop pioneers we didn t ask to be but right then hip hop changed drastically people didn t wanna hear the old rap sound we started samplin beats by james brown in the middle of doin my philosophy scott was killed and that shit got to me but knowin the laws of life and death i knew his breath was one with my breath i had nothin left and it was scary so i dropped by all means necessary another hip hop group that was a friend of me was a revolution crew called public enemy it takes a nation of millions to hold us back these two albums set off consciousness in rap but all along i m still lookin around and all i can see are these rap groups fallin down do you ever think about when you outta here condominium and beach house outta here credit cards and bank accounts outta here no doubt bdp is old school be we ain t goin out 7","artist_name":"KRS-One"},{"lyrics":"from beginning to

as my feet landed firmly upon the vital winter of the second score there appeared before me a heavenly star a holy virgin the bringer of life and breath and she spoke unto me saying  fear not the movement of the heavens above or the earth below for change is what we are my child righteous are those who look up and sway with the wind who look down and dance with the shifting of the soil who swim with the movement of the tides who seek the truth around them and discover that we are and have always been in paradise the reflections of heaven on earth amen and she spoke again saying know my child that there is no devil seekin to cause guilt in the hearts to men no evil save blind faith ignorance and the desire for the unprepared to blame others for the devastation left in the wake of change change my child change is in the heavens change is on this earth change is all around us and if we are reflections of the divine we must roll with these changes for we are these changes eyes wide open we must look upon the heavens as a mirror wide awake aware deeply breathing and when the ship comes down my child you will be there a true and holy survivor to inherit the kingdom of god you will rise above the grumbles of the unprepared to greet the new day to drink from the sweet fruit of the vine the water of life the blood of the risen christ my child go now child tell them all the ignorant the blind paw of dogma blinded by faith the doubters the nay sayers tell them all child they cannot see the kingdom of god they cannot see paradise unfold before them they cannot drink from

fists of rage no angel born in hell could break that satan s spell and as the flames climbed high into the night to light the sacrificial rite i saw satan laughing with delight the day the music died he was singin bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye and singin this ll be the day that i die this ll be the day that

said the music wouldn t play and in the streets the children screamed the lovers cried and the poets dreamed but not a word was spoken the church bells all were broken and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died and there i stood alone and afraid i dropped to my knees and there i prayed and i promised him everything i could give if only he would make the music live and he promised it would live once more but this time one would equal four and in five years four had come to mourn and the music was reborn and they were singin bye bye miss american pie drove my chevy to the levee but the levee was dry and them good old boys were drinkin whiskey n rye singin this ll be the day that i die this ll
