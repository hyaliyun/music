platinum shine thoughts come and cross my mind either i jump or i stay inclined but what if i lose what if i fall and i bruise what if i fall off track feeling the blues what if i hate what i choose can t find my own way back but what if i don t take the leap and stay back making moves past i start to say that should have gone all the way god damn it what if echoes in the back of my mind shit can t rewind it heart said it s gonna tear spine said it s got my back ego told my fears to relax so my fears got rid of my stress soul sat down to confess and my mind ever thinks it affects my chest so my body s gotta trust my soul ready for the odyssey here i go don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid to lose don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid to lose don t be afraid to lose don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid to lose don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid no don t be afraid to lose don t be afraid to lose1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m in my simple box my close imagination sears me in i ve lost exciting thoughts the thus the thirst just take me out to

when you re learning to face the path at your pace every choice is worth your while and there s always retrospect to light a clearer path every five years or so i look back on my life and i have a good laugh you start at the top go full circle round catch a breeze take a spill but ending up where i started again makes me wanna stand still up on the watershed standing at the fork in the road you can stand there and agonize til your agony s your heaviest load you ll never fly as the crow flies get used to a country mile when you re learning to face the path at your pace every choice is worth your while  stepping on a crack breaking up and looking back til every tree limb overhead just seems to sit and wait til every step you take becomes a twist of fate up on the watershed standing at the fork in the road you can stand there and agonize til your agony s your heaviest load you ll never fly as the crow flies get used to a country mile when you re learning to face the path at your pace every choice is worth your while up on the watershed standing at the fork in the road you can stand there and agonize til your agony s your heaviest load you ll never fly as the crow flies get used to a country mile when you re learning to face the path at your pace every choice is worth your while and when you re learning to face the path at your pace every choice is worth your

chocolate cake or like when someone eats too much chocolate cake and then barfs it up and he would just keep talking and it would slowly fade out and say executive producer dick wolf that d be my

four other guys and they bring in this woman who s gonna look at the line up and it s her behind the glass and they open the curtain and she s standing with the two other detectives and i knew she

school his name was mr mcnamara and his son jake mcnamara went to our high school he was a sophomore when i was a senior so he was two years behind me and mr mcnamara was an asshole and one weekend he and his wife decided to leave town which you should never do if you re an asshole and jake mcnamara decided to throw a party at the teacher s house hooray and everyone around town heard about it and we all got up individually and thought okay let s go over there and destroy the place i walked into this party everyone i had ever met was there and everyone was drinking like it was the end of the world people were drinking like it was the civil war and a doctor was coming to saw our legs off it was totally unsupervised we were like dogs without horses we were running wild i walked down i walked down to the basement they had a pool table in the basement one dude took a running start and threw his body onto the pool table and broke it in half another kid found out which room was mr mcnamara s and went upstairs and took a shit on his computer so the party was going great i m standing in the basement and i m holding a red cup you ve seen movies and i m standing there and i m holding a red cup and i m starting to black out and i guess someone said like something something police and in a brilliant moment of word association i yelled fuck da police fuck da police and everyone else joined in a hundred drunk white children yelling fuck da police with the confidence of guys who have already been to jail and aren t afraid of it anymore you know that like i ll serve my nickel you come and take me confidence but white children the reason someone had said something something police was because the police were there so a chicago police officer walked down the stairs and got to the bottom in the basement and looked out over a sea of drunk toddlers yelling fuck the police in his face but he was almost impressed he was like wow and then he leaned into his walkie talkie and went get the paddy wagon and my friend john who is now a father this man now has a baby he grabbed a 40 smashed it on the ground and yelled scatter and everyone ran into different directions we all ran in different directions it was like that scene in ratatouille when the humans come in the kitchen and all the rats go in different ways we all ran in different directions i ran into the laundry room and i jumped up on the washing machine and i crawled out through a window into the backyard and now i m running through the backyard and there was this big chain link fence and i thought i ve never climbed a fence that high before and then i woke up at home on monday i went to school because that s what we did back then and i m walking into the school building and who do i see but jake mcnamara and he says to me hey were you at my party on saturday and i said no you know like a liar and he said things got really outta hand someone broke the pool table someone took a shit on my dad s computer but the worst thing he says the worst thing is that someone stole these old antique photos of my grandmother and my parents are freaking out about it and i had that thought that only blackout drunks and steve urkel can have did i do that i figured no i wouldn t have done that but i was never sure until two years later relax i m playing video games with this kid named alex that we also went to high school with two years later we ve graduated by now we re playing video games for a couple hours and then alex says to me hey come here i want to show you something and he takes me into his bedroom and then he takes me into a side room off of his bedroom never a good thing to have he shows me a tiny room that is covered wall to wall in stolen antique photos from different people s parties over the years and i said why why do you do this and alex said because it s the one thing you can t replace that s the end of that story but how fucked up is that right that s crazy so i don

in here so they re gonna be like i think there is a carnival barker in there i think someone s trying to drum up business for a carnival i decided to do something about this anxiety recently i decided i was gonna try and get a xanax prescription i don t know if anyone here has ever tried xanax but it s fantastic very muted claps for xanax you don t really get woo s its more like yeah i didn t know how to get a xanax prescription though drugs like that a tricky sometimes but i talked to a friend of mine and he said oh yeah i did this he said that he had a regular doctor s appointment and at the end of it he said to his doctor hey doctor sometimes i get nervous on airplanes and the doctor just wrote him a xanax prescription and i m like yeah that s the type of lowbrow shit i m looking for i ll take your advice friend i ve never listened to before so i go to a clinic and i go in and i m just going to go in for you know a regular type of check up and at the end i ll ask about xanax so i get to the front desk and they have a why are you here sheet and i wanna pick something that will get me out really quickly and i look down and i see frequent urination and i was like perfect that ll be a super quick visit you know i ll just be like hey sometimes i pee a lot and the doctor would be like me too crazy right and i ll be like i get nervous on airplanes so i checked off frequent urination and i sat down in the waiting area and i waited for 3 hours i finally go back to the observation room and oh in the observation room there was a male nurse standing there and he has a batman sticker on his stethoscope a batman necklace and a batman watch he was kind of moving around the whole time he was just like alright i am too blessed to be stressed let s do it what are you allergic to besides work and then he d take something and throw it over his shoulder and be like beats working and all of his jokes were anti work which is not always what you want from a health care professional the doctor comes in the room and the doctor looks at my chart and he says oh you re here for frequent urination how many times a day are you urinating and i tried to think of a number that would warrant a doctor visit so i said 11 that was too many times to say the doctor looked at me and said you re peeing 11 times a day then you may have something wrong with your prostate so what we need to do some of you are ahead of me so i don t know exactly how he phrased it but the gist of it was hey if this visit was to continue i m going to stick part of my hand up your ass and i didn t know what to say cause i couldn t be like no that s okay i was lying it was a lie to get drugs you know like a crime so what i did was i pulled down my pants walked over to the observation table and i put my hand on the observation table like this and by the way part of me was like whatever you know you ever have those days where you re like this might as well happen adult life is already so goddamn weird so i m bent over like this on the table and the doctor comes up behind me and says no no no not on your hands your elbows and he knocks me down like that and this is so much worse than this i don t know why i think it s cause this has a little remaining dignity to it you know what i mean this is sort of like go stick it in i am an american this is like you re leaning over the edge of a cruise ship and you re like ah we re approaching martinique he knocked me down to my elbows and then he stuck his hand in and you know how sometimes you re like i bet i know what most things feel like ya know you just think you ll know i did not know what this was gonna feel like and this was the actual sound i made i went ohm but i didn t say it like it came from my vocal cords but it was totally involuntary it was as if a ghost had been trapped in my belly and finally flew out towards the light and then when he pulled his hand out we had gotten to know each other pretty well so i ll phrase this as delicately as a can i did not realize that when the doctor pulls his hand out it feels like your shitting because the only thing to come out of your butt before has been shit so he pulls his hand out and i thought i was shitting into his hand so i yelled i m sorry this is a very routine procedure by the way for most doctors and so far he s had to deal with ohm and i m sorry and he didn t even let me off the hook you know he wasn t like oh don t worry you didn t shit into my hand he just threw his glove away and went ahwahahwah and i was about to ask about xanax but he was like alright your prostate s fine but we still need to do a blood test so i pulled up my pants and shuffled away feeling different and he yells out into the hall he goes hey we re doing a blood test in here get in here and batman dances back in and he s like alright we re gonna do a blood test you look different let s do it the doctor left the room so i m alone with batman i just need this blood test to be over but first i had to tell batman something i was like batman look i m one of those people who when you take blood from me sometimes i can faint and i was in the waiting area for three hours and i haven t eaten all day and i m really worried i m gonna faint and batman said to me and i ll never forget it pshh you re not gonna faint so i stick my arm out batman puts the needle in my arm and i m immediately on the ground i wake up and i am covered in sweat lying on the observation table i wake up i open my eyes and i see batman s face he s looking at me and he goes you gotta go and i go can i please talk to the doctor thought for a sec because sometimes i get nervous on airplanes and batman said the doctor s gone so i got my stuff and i left the moral of the story is that if you ve been nervous your entire life you should ask your doctor about xanax because if you lie to him he will stick his finger in your ass and if you do suffer from frequent urination keep it to yourself i went to that clinic two years later for a different checkup and as i was leaving who do i run into but batman and he smiled at me and he was wearing reading glasses to show that time had passed thanks very much for listening to me my name is john mulaney you were really fun thank you","artist_name":"John Mulaney"},{"lyrics":"valentines day is creeping up on me still staring at you on

the open windows brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field and the singing of birds could be heard in the moment of silence as the preacher opened the bible to read and then a little old man stood up bent with age his hair thin and white and said preacher tell them that satan is real too you can hear him in songs that give praise to idols and sinful things of this world you can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart i know that satan is real for once i had a happy home i was loved and respected by my family i was looked upon as a leader in my community and then satan came into my life i grew selfish and un neighborly my friends turned against me and finally my home was broken apart my children took their paths into a world of sin yes preacher it s sweet to know that god is real and know that in him all things are possible and we know that heaven is a real place where joy shall never end but sinner friend if you re here today satan is real too and hell is a

mousetraps in a bed of all our clothes while i hope that she won t come home it was easier to lock the door and kill the phones than to show my skin because the hardest thing is never to repent for

timing never seemed right when your helicopter came and tried to lift me out i put its rope around my neck and after that you didn t bother with the airlift or the rescue you knew just what to expect  that with the door closed shades drawn we re dead enough they don t open from outside and someone has to speak with their teeth behind their tongue to never let that right be denied we can t rely on photographs and visitation time but i just don t know where to begin i want to bust down the door if you re willing to forgive i ve got the keys i m letting people in don t be scared to speak don t speak with someone s tooth don t bargain when you re weak don t take that sharp abuse some patients can t be saved but that burden s not on you don t ever let anyone tell you you deserve that don t

and my family members and all my friends from all over the country who came over i would like to thank america for the opportunity that baseball have to offer to me uh words have the power to build you or break you and i chose two words to describe pretty much how i feel today in this special day with all of you i have so many things that i would like to say that i don t know if i will find the words in spanish or english but my god i m thankful i m thankful for everything the two words i chose today were god and thank you chose god because he s the reason we re all here he s the one that allows us to be here he s the one that pretty much builds the way for you to make it here to make it in anything you re going to make to actually become who you are i have here the reason why pedro was so determined out there i have here the glory of god with me and i can only look to my left a little bit and i have all the motivation i needed to be the way i was in baseball my family my kids

ramon another veteran in the big leagues i follow his footsteps and led me where i didn t expect to be today so thank you bro for being my support for cleaning the way where i was going to walk so thank you bro i love you forever and respect you as well the rest of my family my brother jesus let me say something to everybody now that i can in 2002 i wasn t given a cy young supposedly because i missed a start well that cy young i didn t win because i gave an opportunity to a kid named josh hancock and why do i bring it up because out of the four brothers that we are ramon nelson me and eventually jesus three of us made it to the big leagues but jesus is not in the record books because the organization that he was playing for did not find a chance to give him one pitch in the big leagues so that he could be in the records and that was the main reason why decided not to take that outing to give it to josh hancock because i felt bad that my brother jesus did not experience what it was like to pitch in that game that day so jesus don t feel bad we pitch enough for you and we re here so love you baseball is yours too and what we get it s ours i could like to thank god also for my beautiful wife my other mother luz maria my other partner in crime ana lelia my cousins my nephews lilly i don t have enough words to say how much i appreciate you my in laws all the people that have some how influenced my life but carolina i must say what you re doing the way youre dealing with me i know im not an easy out when it comes to making me keep quiet especially after i retired where i didn t know what i was going to do with so much time carolina i love you i appreciate what you have done for my family the things you have gone through to get all my family here close to a hundred people we have here ladies and gentleman and carolina kerry pam nancy lane they were responsible for us being here and making this moment so special i love you all nana gracias por ser otra madre para mi people in baseball that i feel so fortunate to have had by my side you know it s funny but i have so many names i want to mention and we waited 32 years to see one more dominican and you have to imagine there were a lot of people involved in this so i m gonna just drop a couple names of names that i would like to mention after i thank god for the beautiful family that s witnessing what we have today right away i have to thank avila rafael avila the man with the biggest history as far as ball players coming out of the dominican republic just if you didn t know that s rafael

republic eleodoro arias my first coach who was always there to teach me the baby steps that i needed to take to become better every day i have a gentleman here that i think is crazy i have a gentleman here whose name is dan duquette he was crazy twice to trade for the same little player and both times he ended up looking great and he wanted me for a third time but i was too old so dan thank you for having so much faith in me trusting i was gonna make you look good i thought you were good looking without me but i guess i shaped you more i have here a name oh i m gonna say two names that i can t

and you just told me that s only a little slump how did you get into the slump you got into the slump pitching well that s the same way you have to come out of it and i kept my faith and i kept my head up and i kept working and today i can say i thank you for that and the organ yes kept on playing i would like to take the moment to thank all the franchises i played for la dodgers montreal expos
