shot then nobody fired back he took no crap i admit i admired that cause dude was a legend his story spun far and wide and it scarred my pride down to my little heart inside i took every mission i could accept to make my mark cause i wanted the power and respect that he had but alas i was just a plebian then the war ended before i could get to leave again then i heard he found some documents about his true origin and then he got convinced that he was not of this earth bred to be a soldier the spawn of an alien life form jenova infused with the cells while still in the womb heard the news and he was hellbent on sealin the doom of anybody who participated burned the whole town down killed millions and everything was dissipated i gave chase and the saga begun he released jenova then they both united as one repeat 2x so tifa tells me she can reconstruct the pieces of my past fill in the gaps cause i m sick of wearin a mask the framerate s mad spotty like a ps1 the story kinda cloudy

appears to be so in fact i was kidnapped by shinra beat down and tortured so i couldn t remember but now i m hot like a scalding pot all of us were enhanced mako showers and jenova cell implants crazy

asked me to live for him and yeah i must ve agreed to so i ve lived a double life for the past five years and told lies to people who believed you but i was manipulated by seph gotta find him and kill

forever of all your efforts and all your achievements and all your attainments turning into dust and nothingness what is the feeling what happens to you it s a curious thing that in the world s poetry this is a very common theme the earthy hope men set their hearts upon turns ashes or it prospers and anon like snow upon the desert s dusty face lighting a little hour or two is gone so in this way by seeing that nothingness is the fundamental reality and you see it s your reality then how can anything contaminate you all the idea of your being scared and put out and worried and so on is just nothing it s a dream because you re really nothing so cheer up all the sun and the stars and the mountains and rivers and the good men and bad men and the animals and the insects the whole bit all are

eyes no more i don t want nobody else cause baby i m all yours and i mma let it be known from ca to the 904 everyone needs someone no one wants to be forgotten cause we all need someone to talk with someone that we can share our thoughts with 2 am cartoons rice krispies and hot chocolate what i m tryna say is that somebody for me is you it was our destiny to meet i know you see it too but as time keeps ticking away i love you like you ll never know until the end of my days yours truly i feel your heart becoming close i love you like you ll never know i feel your heart becoming so close i love

out cannot care that they re naked there is something burning in here when it burns i hold my own shell to my ear listen for the parade when i was seven the man who played the bagpipes wore a skirt he was from scotland so i wanted to move there wanted my spine to be the spine of an unpublished book my faith the first and last page the day my ribcage became monkey bars for a girl hanging on my every word they said you are not allowed to love her tried to take me by the throat to teach me i was not a boy i had to unlearn their prison speak refuse to make wishes on the star on the sherif s chest i started wishing on the stars in the sky instead i said to the sun tell me about the big bang the sun said it hurts to become i carry that hurt on the tip of my tongue and whisper bless your heart every chance i get so my family tree can be sure i have not left you do not have to leave to arrive i am learning this slowly so sometimes i look in the mirror and my eyes look like the holes in the shoes of the shoe shine man some days my hands are busy on the wrong things some days i call my arms wings well my head is in the clouds it will take me a few more years to learn that flying is not pushing away the ground but safety isn t always safe you can find one in every gun i am aiming to do better this is my body my exhaustion pipe will never pass inspection and still my lungs know how to

stitched me up asked me if i did it for attention for the record if you have ever done anything for attention this poem is attention title it with your name it will scour the city bridge every time you stand staring at the river it never wants to find your body doing anything but loving what it loves love what you love say this is my body it is no one s but mine this is my nervous system my wanting blood my tongue tied up like a ball of christmas lights if you put a star on the top of my tree make sure it s a star that fell make sure it hit bottom like a tambourine because all these words are stories to the staircase to the top of my lungs where i sing what hurts and the echo comes back bless your heart bless your holy knee caps they are so smart you are so full of rain there is

heat of the night hit him like a freight train moving with a simple twist of fate a clarinet some place softly played she was walkin on by the arcade she heard the melody rise and fade the sun was comin up she dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate and forgot about a simple twist of fate he woke up and she was gone he didn t see nothing but the dawn he got out of bed with his clothes back on pushed back blind found a note she d left behind to which he just could not relate all about a simple twist of fate he hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along through the city blocks hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in maybe she ll see him once again oh how long must he wait one more time for a simple twist of fate people tell me that it s a

mine but i keep on meeting broken minds that are only twenty nine in a world where god has taken off and the wars have been and gone a person s left with just themselves and their own specific song and if this world which sits alone in the space of its own tune were to sing a song that painted well this master of the moon it d be the hound dog whistle of a falling nuclear bomb and the sighing cries of the revolutionaries who have waited far too long and even worse the howling crap of the justin bieber blues and if it s the case that you like that stuff then no offense to you but if you

the case take a look around and try to grasp that we are young for every one direction song there s a gracious rising sun and every act of pointless hate there s a million loving mums and every four years we peacefully cheer to watch some strangers run and if i cause offense by saying so then i did not mean you none but if you just wade through the noise each generation holds a gem a building block that you may miss but are sure to see again you can fight the fire but you can t deny the reality you re in but it gets you wondering if you put life in a cider glass and drank the whole thing down you might just end up drunk enough to get another round and what that means is basically with pleasure comes the pain and personally once i am done i ll have the same again because if you just

the corner is the only one who dreams he had you with him my body turns and yearns for a sleep that will never come it s never over my kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder it s never over all my riches for her smiles when i slept so soft against her it s never over all my blood for the sweetness of her laughter it s never over she s the tear that hangs inside my soul forever well maybe i m just too young to keep good love from going wrong oh lover you should ve come over cause it s not too late well i feel too young to hold on and i m much too old to break free and run too deaf dumb and blind to see the damage i ve done sweet lover you should ve come over oh love well i m waiting for you lover you should ve come over cause it s not too late","artist_name":"Natalie
