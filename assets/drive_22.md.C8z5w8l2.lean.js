three city blocks well i guess every driver for miles around had caught teddy bear s call and that little crippled boy was having a ball for as fast as one driver would carry him in another would carry him to his truck and take off again well you better believe i took my turn at riding teddy bear and then carried him back in and put him down in his chair and buddy if i never live to see happiness again i want you to know i saw it that day in the face of that little man we took up a collection for him before his mama got home and each driver said goodbye and then they were all gone he shook my hand with a mile long grin and said so long trucker i ll catch you again ah i hit that interstate with tears in my eyes i turned on the radio and i got another surprise breaker 1 9 came the

no rain on roof that grates and beats me my favourite tree breaking light to pieces sprinkling sharded light on me throw a stone as high as you can and hearing with hand not hear it land nothing taxing dusting sand my window world spins and twirls the walls then fall i recall the sort white clouds whitewash faded spotless the weighty shadows ranges of rocks the cold is all an illusion thought up i stroll on the shore snooze and explore all possibilities in each new morning til satisfied reaching out and yawning fish in a big dish some rice and spice salt over shoulder never salted so tight the truth i have told was silence sometimes but whose soul does not hide any crimes wrapped in walls encircled by work the walls fall the story occurs no barrier no boundary or allow as i please the freedom to stay or stray be fiend or friend cause no harm but charm the peaceful end  i ll not feel no fear cause i m not really here i m nowhere near here i ll not feel no fear cause i m not really here i m nowhere near here pale ancient woods strew white sandy bays this ugly room pales away today i m swimming in the ocean i sink slow motion fingers toes floating every year til yesterday i ve seen the eternal setting sea i compare all this to me it s all fleeting momentary me i blink my eyes this is reminding me life lies in the blink of an eye the old die for reasons new tides four seasons new life born is like sneezing all these walls were really never there nor the ceiling or the chair i m eking weeks of peace on a beach i see the breezes weave the trees i m not here at all you re dearly fooled i see bustling trees the shush at the sea the mischievous fluttering seagulls no i m not trapped in a box i m glancing at rocks i m dancing off docks since this dance began that s

think he wanted me changed i am more than the missed calls and the lost friends and the my bads here we go again and i m like when will it ever end i m more than the misunderstandings and the way that i look from their vantage i know it but can i be candid it s hard to remember when it feel like my best just ain t good enough i take my best shots and put em up reality break in and call my bluff

smoke or shoot up used to have a crew cut now he s a pooh butt dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang hanging on the streets selling caine to his own people now when i say people i mean color you a stupid mother i m trying to stress the fact that you re dumb get yourself presentable son and just come together you better cause pretty soon it s gonna be too late a message from king tee the great  sisters since we are the mothers of this earth it s time we start being good mothers from the birth of our children no time for sleeping teach them to fight and win for the right reason it s your time it s your life live it proud to be black young and gifted lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route gang violence needs to be wiped out a l m i g h ty and e z i r e we see the f u t u r e should be a positive thing body soul and you we re in the same gang one and the same everyone came in the same chains caught with the same aim brain games and names changed to protect the innocent by stander lies slander and the master planner destroy the black male crack jail and semi automatic for static if the crack fails so since we all talk the same slang stop killin my brother cause we re all from the same gang don t you know we ve got to put our heads together make the change cause we re all in the same gang now as a youth i used to get my bang on and on the ave get my part time slang on doing time for me was no joke though they knew i was crazy so they labelled me loco khakis creased golf hat feelin sporty low ridin and tossin up a forty thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us the downest brothers ever touched los angeles i found life was much more suitable cause i m the brother that makes black so beautiful i ain t slippin or down with a head

all in the same gang bein the pimps that we are we re here to speak on a situation that has gone too far here at home in the ghettos of la where a young black brother s not promised to see the next day cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats but fools just lay and prey on the weak it don t depend on the color of a rag cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have cause violence don t only revolve from drugs and thugs and gangs that bang most times it s a political thang yeah a couple of spots ll get popped and if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped but they don t because they want it like that because the system been set up to hold us back yeah above the law means that we can do whatever so why don t we stick together ice t rippin the microphone the way i do listen close my brothers cause i m talkin to you the problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild i say job you say bad joke i d rather jack another brother watch the gun smoke livin in the fast lane flippin like you re insane you won t stop until your blood runs down the street drain i got an idea give me a minute and if it makes sense then get with it what if we could take our enemies feed em poison undereducate their girls and boys and split em up make em fight one another better yet make em kill for a color all my brothers need to know one thing no matter what you think we re all in the same gang don t you know we ve got to put our heads together stop the fighting because we re all in the same gang yo we re not here to preach because we re not ministers we re telling like it is cause ren and dre is like sinister reality speaks for itself when it s spoken a basehead cluck can t blame nobody for smoking yo bullets flying mothers crying brothers dying lying in the streets that s why we re trying to stop it from falling apart and going to waste and keeping a smile off of white face n w a never preaching just teaching the knowledge of the streets to each and all that don t understand that s why we came to let you know that we re all in the same gang the j double f the a the d that is and if you want the solution to the quiz what s black and black yo and kills another an ignorant sucker that isn t labelled as a brother but another so now it s time we evolve and get together and solve it cause the world is revolvin around a terrible situation one will kill another for a reputation so it s time we stop and realize that we re all the same yo train tell em brothers killin other brothers i thought the idea was to love one another open up the paper to one more death if y all keep this up then there ll be no one left i try my best to set an example sayin hype over hip hop samples not just a brag or to boast but to inform cause we re livin in the calm before the storm you see i believe that the children are the future but what s it all about if in the future they shoot ya we re all

talking and i really wish that there was a little more time to speak but you know it could be a hassle trying to explain myself to a police officer about how it was your old lady got herself stiffed and it s not like we could help but there was nothing no one could do and if there was man you know i would have been the first oh when someone turns that blue well it s a universal truth then you just know that bitch will never fuck again by the way that s really some bad shit that you came to our place with but you ought to be more careful around the little girls it s either the best or it s the worst and since i don t have to choose i guess i won t and i know this ain t no way to treat a guest but why don t you grab your old lady by the feet and just lay her out in the darkest street and by morning she s just another hit and run you know some people got no choice and they can never find a voice to talk with that they can even call their own so the first thing that they see that allows them the right to be why they follow it you know it s called bad luck part c slipaway well hey man that s just a lie it s the lie she tells her friends cause a real song the real song she won t even admit to herself the beating in her heart it s a song lots of people know it s a painful song with a load of sad truth but life s full of sad songs penny for a wish but wishin won t make you so joe

what i saw i d describe the houses opposite the little patch of grass next to the path the gate with its rotten hinges forever wedged open that dad was always going to fix she d stand there quiet for a moment i thought she was trying to develop the images in her own head then she d say i can see little twinkly stars like christmas tree lights in faraway windows rings of brightly coloured rocks floating around orange and mustard planets i can see huge tiger striped fishes chasing tiny blue and yellow dashes all tails and fins and bubbles i d look at the grey house opposite and close the curtains she burned down the house when she was ten i was away camping with the scouts the fireman said she d been smoking in bed the old story i thought the cat and our mum died in the flames so dad took us to stay with our aunt in the country he went back to london to find us a new house we never saw him again on her thirteenth birthday she fell down the well in our aunt s garden and broke her head she d been drinking heavily on her recovery her sight returned a fluke of nature everyone said that s when she said she d never blink again i would tell her when she started at me with her eyes wide and watery that they reminded me of the well she fell into she liked this it made her laugh she moved in with a gym teacher when she was fifteen all muscles he was he lost his job when it all came out and couldn t get another one not in that kind of small town everybody knew every one else s business my sister would hold her head high though she said she was in love they were together for five years until one day he lost his temper he hit over the back of the neck with his bull worker she lost the use of the right side of her body he got three years and was out in fifteen months we saw him a while later he was coaching a non league football team in a cornwall seaside town i don t think he recognized her my sister had put on a lot of weight from being in a chair all the time she d get me to stick pins and stub out cigarettes in her right hand she d laugh like mad because it didn t hurt her left hand was pretty good though we d have arm wrestling matches i d have to use both arms and she d still beat me we buried her when she was 32 me and my aunt the vicar and the man who dug the hole she said she didn t want to be cremated and wanted a cheap coffin so the worms could

road less traveled there s a road winding road that never ends","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"it seems like once upon a time ago i was where i was supposed to be my vision was true and my heart was too there was no end to what i could dream i walked like a hero into the setting sun everyone called out my name death to me was just a mystery i was too busy raisin up cain but nothing lasts forever your best efforts don t always pay sometimes you get sick and you don t get better that s when life is short even in its longest days so you pretend not to notice that everything has changed the way that you look and the friends you once had so you keep on acting the same deep down in your soul you know you got no flame and who knows then which way to go life is short even in its longest days all i got here is a rear view mirror reflections of where i ve been so you tell yourself i ll be back up on top some day but you know there s nothing waiting up there for you anyway nothing lasts forever and your best efforts don t always pay sometimes you get sick and you don t get better that s when life is short even in its longest days life is short even in its longest days1","artist_name":"John
