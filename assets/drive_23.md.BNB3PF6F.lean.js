came across this stunning young piece who resided at the bottom of the sea and she told me her name was splash woman beautiful but deadly she was mad cunning had a voice that could soothe the savage beast her physique was way above average magic the way she got me in a spell got me on lockdown sort of like a cell but i got a mission that i can t afford to fail but girl i got a secret to tell umm

singin and i had to listen it was lovely when she sang the fish came all of a sudden the mission changed insane she told me about her true purpose she was a state victim that fell through the surface a few days ago the contract expired and she was scheduled to be thrown into the fire and wily gave her a reason to live so now she gotta do what he says she shed a tear and said you don t understand i gotta stick to the plan i owe everything to this man so please mega ran don t take it personal cause it hurts i know i ll make it worse y know but he saved me baby to turn my back on wily would be just plain crazy she said it s the only way it can end let the battle begin and we can t be friends so my heart sunk low as the lair door closed drew the mega buster cause it s time to roll here we go  i thought i was in love before but i love you more so baby come aboard and go away with me so i can make you see what you mean to me and baby we can be free oh ohhhhh under the sea oh ohhhhh just you and me so the battle was on and it was fierce she hit me in the side and left the armor pierced on her command the fishes attacked me i cocked the mega buster and hit em exactly but the battle took a turn that was odd every time i fired a shot she didn t dodge she took each blast from the arm cannon smiled at me as every shot was landin at first i didn t know what she was plannin then suddenly i started understandin yo i think she lettin me win givin me what i need so i can get to the end by the 17th hit she began to stagger fell to the ground so i ran and grabbed her looked up in her eyes as she tried to laugh pulled me close and handed me her staff i said i wish it didn t have to be like this i m thinkin he might miss her if she be my miss she said don t be foolish you gotta do this let the whole city know what the truth is boy you got stuff to do i said girl i woulda gave it all up for you i feel invincible when i m holdin you but as far as love goes i m 0 for 2 i thought i was in

marched me down to the center of town with their pitchforks high in the air i was chained and bound with a blindfold around so the judge wouldnt catch my stare and they hung my soul from the gallows pole but the witch they never found so to those who dont fit societys mold learn to swim or you will drown and the rain falls down let it fall to the ground and the birds dont sing no they dont make a sound so i look to the sky tell me why tell me why do they all get to live and i have to die and the angels sing let it shine let it shine dry the teardrops from my eyes and the bells will ring when the blind lead the blind cause the dead cant testify and because i cant take an eye for an eye in the afterlife ill haunt you till you die and the rain falls down let it fall to the ground and the

listen to that before you continue with this please for me i was always i m im just a huge fan of music you know i wear my heart on my sleeve my inspirations on my sleeve and one of them is kanye west and i always loved his song addiction you know what s you addiction is it money is it cars is it i got addict you know it s just like i wanted to do something as well but like i said i grew up in a in a pretty crazy household and i saw you know the use of narcotics and alcohol and how it destroyed my family so i i never really went down that so i i never really had an addiction except cigarettes and i thought well that s kinda corny like you know what i mean cigarettes is so frowned upon how can i do it in a way where people can relate to it and then i i i discovered the concept of nikki and taking it much more further than just this song putting her all over the album and if i talk about nikki as if she is in fact a woman then it would it would it would allude to that and um but it s even before then you know i mean nine months before the album was even out i would hashtag who s nikki on twitter this or that who s nikki who s nikki and everybody was wondering everybody thinks is it his mom is it an ex girlfriend is it it a this is it his sister is it blah and everybody wants to know everybody wants to know then you hear me on the record on bounce in the whip everyday wit nikki she be ridin wit me you know different things like that and youre like what who is this chick who is this chick and then you get to the song and i i i wrote it as almost as if it was a break up song i love it when you re fresh i love it when i take your top off and we share the same breath like uhh matters of making love or this or that and when you finally get to the end and it s like nicotine it s like that wow moment you know i remember watching saw for the first time and realizing that the killer was in the room the entire time and i was like oh my god you know what i mean so thats what i wanted to create and i think i did my best to create a song where it s not just nicotine i could be heroin it could be alcohol it could be sex it could be gambling it could be whatever your thing is um maybe it isn t even that bad or maybe it s just a man or a woman that you re dealing with or i i wrote it so surface level that the listener can take it however they want and then deep down you would know what the song is about","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"yeah yeah this ain t nothin new i been at it glorified the son of man at it lot of people talkin lookin at the kid time to

still sadness in your eyes you can t deny do you tremble and sigh when he holds you just like i do what were you thinking of to throw away our love and it s easy to say that you won t give in again you were just tempted for a moment and half but it s so hard when you desire to lose control i don t know what this feeling is but it sure seems cold i felt the chill before the winter came i suffered the pain and then accepted the shame i will have lost your love by end of this sad refrain i felt the cold creeping over my skin still as the air until the wind rushed in still in control holding on to my heart and soul only inches from sin","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"fox in the snow where do you go to find something you could eat because the word out on the street is you are starving don t let

offer you the kingdom of your dreams but nothing s ever as it seems you find yourself farther downstream alone save for the echoes of your screams ah honey fairy tales are prone to tease well candles

safe you will still feel vulnerable you draw a bath and pour some wine you drink yourself into another time well you feel truly free the water s rising overhead and you wake to find yourself in bed you re gasping for breath it s hard to breathe ah honey dreams are rarely what they seem oh however many takes it takes well step outside into the sun let it dry your eyes and run around feel the warm underneath your skin the clouds will soon move in again you can t expect to always win you ve got to take it as it comes the marching bands and beating drums play familiar songs for the alum we ve all

because it is but because you want it to be because you re so goddamned lonely so goddamned unable to handle the ocean roar in your ears when you re alone you tell yourself that the ash in your lungs is as good as a kiss goodnight and you write poems about the smoke tendrils whispering off her lips how beautiful they are how like the aching arms of god you always wanted them to be one night you re tired so very tired your eyes as heavy as water you forget where you are in the break room at a walmart at 2 30 in the morning and you leave your notebook unattended on the table left out for anyone in the world to see one of your coworkers picks it up and reads the poems you wrote about the girl with honeycomb and jasmine in her eyes and you panic when you realize what just happened and you panic when you realize what just happened because the boy who picked up your notebook he s a cruel boy with eyes like shotguns and razorwire he buys you razorblades on your birthday so you can do the job right next time you fucking freak and you can t believe that you aren t one can t believe you deserve to be anything some days you don t even try to hide the angry marks on your arm like your skin is a test where you got every question wrong one night there s a boxcutter with a brand new blade a stack of cardboard boxes begging to feel its tooth you dig in but something s wrong the fiber s too gnarled and you can t seem to cut clean you push hard as you can feel the stiff tangle of glue give way and there s blood on the floor the blade half an inch in your wrist but you don t feel it the shift manager is in your ear angry because he has to take you to the hospital and there s a janitor who ll forever hold it against you for staining his clean clean floor and there s everyone you work with and their hostile eyes glaring knowing this was always always coming along that there s that cacophony all those ghosts reminding you of your destiny for failure and there s another blade and there s a bottle of pills a fifth of vodka a hospital visit two weeks of inpatient while your whole family prays for you to get better there s a doctor with blank eyes who never looks at you hes always scribbling things on his clipboard everything you say he documents even when you re not talking to him you don t smoke but you still go out for smoke breaks with everyone else on the ward because there s nothing else to do but stare at the walls and wait for the next group session to start so you hang out in the courtyard not smoking cigarettes but still befriending those who do and there s a man maybe ten years older than you with eyes like rough cut pine and sunset he notices you don t smoke so he tries to stay downwind from you so he doesnt exhale in your face he tells you it s okay bud we ll get through this and be better when we leave this place than it was when we got here and he s telling you the truth and you believe him one day the doctor who doesn t look at you comes to your room and tells you that your insurance isn t paying for any more days so you re all better now and you leave your mom picks you up in the lobby and her eyes are the most worried kindness you ve ever seen and you go home and you fight off the ghosts which is easier now than it was before because now you have a better set of tools today and your life goes on like it was meant to like you were always supposed to survive the fight you stop writing poems about smoke tendrils trailing off the lips you once wanted to kiss or about how your loneliness is so unbearable because now you write poems about how to stay alive you write poems about the places you feel at home rather than the places you wish you could be one day you catch a glimpse of someone in the mirror and there you are eyes like stubbornness and struggle like the brick buildings in abandoned factory towns that refuse to fall completely you look at all the scars the history etched into your arms like a road map of where you used to be versus the endless possibilities of where you are and where you can go now and the smoke tendrils once midnight black and swirling above your head break away leaving nothing in your view except the sky and it is so perfect and it is so clear6","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"we get all the knowledge that you need four will drown and one will cross the sea we are your receiver
