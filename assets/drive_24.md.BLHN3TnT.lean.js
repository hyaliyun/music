him in the ambulance jimmy just laughed it escalated like stairs that move until jimmy decided that he was too cool for school years later he was doing coke off the floor again when chris graduated as the valedictorian he was yawning as he came around the corner mumbled talking looking like a speed walker sorta bags under his eyes days since he slept sweat on his brow made his face all wet his wild eyes fixed on cvs as he pulled a bandanna up off of his neck adjusted something in his over sized jorts fiddled with it as he walked up to the door of the store it was jimmy came here to rob this shit he had done it a couple times and safely split his arm swung pale you could see his arteries vile as he s walking down the aisle toward the pharmacy he surveyed the scene only one dude in line as far as he could see so he grabbed that pistol by the handle part of it and demanded oxycontin as he pointed at the pharmacist who quickly obliged handed over every pill they had on the other side a pocket full of oxys as he went to bail but the next thing he remembers is waking up in jail our homie chris had a flight that night to japan after one interview they said he was their man he d be rich within the year so say konichiwa to the head systems engineer but he s still an asthmatic so he s at the pharmacy stocking up for his travels waiting in line he s the only one and then he sees some dude with a gun it s fucking jimmy that same bully from school who had called him a fag and kicked him in the jewels what a fool ooh retribution would be great cause chris was in shape drinking protein shakes he d been in the gym through college while jimmy graduated onto oxycontin so when jimmy turned around and started walkin chris took a decisive step toward him there was nothing that could stop him he

would that be time enough i can t remember exactly when this longing began but i know it wasn t before the day you touched my hand laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged but i m still waiting and i m still waiting and if my hand could block the sun would we ever wake up and if i turned back all these clocks would that be time enough so put your hands where i can see them and shut your mouth i know who you are in a world void of feeling or heart i know that we are the torches in the dark let s break this down let s make this count let s leave this one horse town no better time than now let s break this down let s make this count let s leave this one horse town no better time than now  the angels dance like feathers float they re here to see and to be seen the clock strikes two the music slows and each one slowly dons their wings once outside they all pair off and hand in hand they leave but i m still waiting and i m still waiting and if my hand could block the

in time to see rehearsal and john came out and lip synched his new lite beer commercial and as the crowd arrived as far as i could see the faces were all different there was no one there like me they sat in golden circles and waiters served them wine and talked through all the music and to john paid little mind and way up in the nosebleeds we watched upon the screen they d hung between the billboards so cheaper seats could see johnny rocked that golden circle and all those vip s and that music that had freed us became a tired routine and i saw his face in close up trying to give it all he had and sometimes his eyes betrayed him you could see that he was sad and i tried to rock along with him but i slowly became bored could that man on stage with everything somehow need some more

street city symphony when people sleep and the masses shut shutters like clockwork freestyle after dusk buskers motor full of mates late night escapades stealth renegades burners they set ablaze paintings flourish all the way down the boulevard block party late whole street full of cars skaters illuminate the bowl with their headlights hear the street riders roll when they rev bikes nightriders carve the mountain in the valley haze covert op talent sprays in the alleyways kids in the palace of play cloaked in the dark night summertime shooting hoops under the park lights

the deep end children of the night when the days gone and it unwinds let them play on till the sunrise rise till were all in flight this is for my people who are children of the night theres to many places to park down memory lane so let me simply start when i remembered the rain hit the tin roof while sitting on my balcony isolated like a pirate cast out to sea intrigued by what those city lights offer the world is your oyster type shit and thats proper hypnotised by its highs and its lows a lifestyle that keeps your eyes on the road see theres searchers on the prowl for that crowbar access and graffers throwing up those whole car classics its magic to watch the world trying to compete a tapestry of culture intertwined with the beast and thats right where i eat where the night never sleeps and all i needs a mic and a beat for life in the streets over years ive put strength in pain standing strong writing songs on an empty train yeah ive lived a life worth of movies framed through my crooked lens ive travelled way beyond where the book will end ive seen the visual effects behind the scenes ive found a whole other world trying to find my dreams and temptation will test if you can keep your faith with the smile of a cheshire cat to lead the way under night lights well never stop building so welcome to the city of the lost children  in the evening when the stars climb

in flight this is for my people who are children of the night from the kids in the burbs playing capture the flag to the cans packed in bags lads attack with their tags the core elements forces of sick skills back lane breakers in an orbit of windmills writers hit the tracks in the yard where the trains stay the beat spills and it trickles down the laneways the streets are bubbling the beats are rumbling the free runners swing across an urban jungle gym in the evening when the stars climb you can see them children of the night through the seasons on the dark side in the deep end children

the prize a friend of mine once told me we have many paths in this journey they act in different directions so when you question don t be worried it s not a wrong one beauty can be found in all of them you ll meet people whose paths intersect but you don t know how long you ll walk with them cause the truth is and it s so hard but you ll never know how long we ll continue with our loved ones down this rugged road the path veers and it s clear that we must steer alone i ve learned if you can t hold on to that moment that exists let it go cause freedom is god freedom is acknowledging the mask you have on and possessing the strength to take it off freedom is accepting every step of the path and when it s hard having faith in the ability to embrace it that s where you are and this is it the same shit that we work towards but go against in the same sense my friend hit me to some game and truth unraveled she said the brighter the light the darker the shadow and since i m on cliche terms knowing is half the battle but i don t know so i just go with what was destined life can be a burden or a blessing the choice is yours to be connected it s there if you want it you got it now

into this world alone and alone you ll go out all i have is myself and everyone else i doubt you can only trust yourself and depend on the help of the pound inside of the chest that beats with the breath of the now no sunshine when she s gone i can only see clouds no homies can hold me down the spirit s testing me now but i can withstand this world but it seems so foul flood of emotions it s like i m being held down to drown hell s right around the corner but i can turn it around you always have a choice no matter the situation you re not bound to nothing no one you re chosen for this job this is your life you can t escape this bitch when it s hard just know that it passes but you ll collect scars they never go away but they will make you who you are this is a beautiful struggle i share it in song cause i can t control this remember the moment s beyond us  hold your head up there s a light in the sky i know you re fed up but you must try to survive each moment s precious don t
