orders and promise you rewards like busting up your family by sending you abroad a holiday in germany or iceland or hong kong making money being useless well it seems it can t go wrong but then it s off to northern ireland where you ll practice what they preached you ll shoot to keep yourself alive and kill to keep the peace and then it won t be so much fun as you hear the wounded crying cos before they couldn t speak english and you didn t know what they were saying but when the children call you bastard it will make you think again when you cannot tell the difference between animals and men animals don t wear uniforms but they kill as much as you but the army kills for money and animals kill for food it s the basest degredation in the name of what is right become something you never were and regret it til you die cos your father will tell you sonny you must do as you are told and you ll say the same thing to your kids when you re 32 years old and unless you can react against the brainwash from the start your government will rule your mind and your mind will rule your heart you ll conform to every social law and be the system s slave from birth to school to work to death from

know where every door and passageway go but i ve been living up here for 22 years so i know i know what lies behind all of these doors all too well most of them are great but i don t open those so much so i couldn t tell you see the door that i know all too well is this little closet at the end of the hallway it welcomes me like a holiday but always leaves me feeling like hell and history has given me countless reasons of why i should avoid it at all costs yet it seems my countless demons continue to contradict that with addictive thoughts and before i can stop i find myself hesitantly opening that door locked i glance back as if it s too late it s not but i ve let this thought become an action and now this action s gaining traction and as i twist the handle and they all come crashing out skeletal hands surround trying to pull me down i turn try and close the door or at least scream for some help but there s a vice grip around my neck so nothing comes out i try to run but the deed has already been done it was a choice that i made now i m going to fall prey to the skeletons and now i am struggling to breathe but i keep quiet so that nobody sees me nobody needs to see these skeletal beings fighting to death to keep hold of me i make promises i can t keep i m a zombie by day because at night i don t sleep embarrassment is my camouflage i don t hold hands because i m a damaged fraud i need the hand of god i need a hand to god i don t need a hand i m all good for the millionth time i whisper this lie to myself as i push the hands back and slam the door on this hell exhausted i stagger to the end if the hallway breathing a sigh of relief just another days work utterly isolated thinking what could be wrong with my nature i mean how else does one get picked for this great curse disoriented and lost i make my escape towards the first door that i find turn the key twist the knob only to reveal yet another army of skeletons behind no i didnt mean to go back i didn t mean to go back i can t last another attack i m falling victim to my present all because of my past i m falling prey to the skeletons so all i see are ruined reputations scandals and defeat not that i failed to plan just that my plans failed me scratch that cuz i m done with these cycles of saying sorry no more falling prey to the other side s army and sos i need support i need more than my words can say i need words that can change the kind of words that made this world in six days and just then i heard em from the voice of a friend full of confidence and love it was the voice a parent uses when enough is enough and he said his grace is enough and sufficient for me that his power is made perfect whenever i am weak and if that s what makes me free i will scream about my weakness so his power will always walk with me this will no longer be the sound of me being beat down this is the sound of me rebounding the sound of me coming back to life like a former addict who says he s gotta new lease on life or the sound of a soldier coming home to his wife or hear the momma scream when the doctor says your baby s gonna make it through the night this is favor that we don t deserve saving grace that you cannot put into words so it s time to open my closet doors and let the light shine through cuz i want you to know you aren t alone in your struggle too you see a secret is only a secret as long as you re willing to keep it and freedom will only come when you release it i need you to believe it 1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"a shot to the veins taste the rush i was lost on an

to see all the lights shining there so pretty and think of the millions of lives going on at this present moment and those come and gone and it make me float free to feel how small my life must be and it make me float free to feel how small my life must be when ever i can i go down to the sea and wonder at how many miles there must be and all of the people on all of its shores at this present moment and those gone before and it makes me float free to feel how small my life must be and it make me float free sometimes i m out in the bustling street dazz led by all of the faces i see it strikes me we get lost so soon after birth but one smile can turn over heaven and earth and it makes me float free to feel how small my life must be and it makes me float free to feel how small my life must be and it makes me float free to feel how small my life must be and it makes me float free to feel how small my life must be","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"if you re fond of sand dunes and
