sunday and uh it was about it was a parable and it was talking about the uh the disciples and jesus when they were going through a corn field and they began to pick the corn and the pharisees the legalistics of the day they came and they were chastising them that why are you doing this on the sabbath they had this whole discourse and dialog between the two of them jesus was saying listen do you do you not remember that you you yourself aren t even worthy you guys break unleavened bread on on the sabbath and you kill the sacrifice you clean the sacrifice they have a need and it s my job and my responsibility to meet their need and i m at their need i trump the synagogue i trump the sabbath i m lowered of your life i m lowered of everything that is you i m lowered of this this day recognize who you re talking to but in the course of the whole thing what i realize is that the dialog was between the pharisees or the religious leaders of the day was between the dignitaries the officials of the church and jesus the disciples never uttered a word he literally started embodying his permanent position in our lives because he stepped in between the law and the people he says no i m grace and because of me they don t have to defend themselves to you i ll do all the talking my blood will speak through all of eternity i have justified them even in their wrong i know that they are wrong i know that they make mistakes i know that they are not perfect i know that they do things that are not pleasing but even in their wrong my blood will speak on their behalf and i will just somebody should have shouted right there because he didn t kill you for all the sinful acts that you committed but he justified you god bless me with this song it simply speaks the life of that

satisfied joking and talking about the world outside with hungry hearts through the heat and cold we never much thought we could get very old we thought we could sit forever in fun and our chances really was a million to one as easy it was to tell black from white it was all that easy to tell wrong from right and our choices they was few so the thought never hit that the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split how many a year has passed and gone many a gamble has been lost and won and many a road taken by many a first friend and each one ive never seen again  i wish i wish i wish

the surface showed the sky without a border and the air was so much hotter so so deep how the woke dreamer screamed and it rose tides and the waves stretched up like a mountain high and the no gills

translator as the stakes and the skills and the love became greater for a artform to spread from east to westside the coast the hemisphere look how hip hop grew but it s still the proverbial sad clown of music exploited by many understood by few i do the knowledge to the game from a bird s eye view if i ain t have the stomach for it i d have been passed through cause every level i examined from a r to zigga zigga prove a mc ain t got a god damn clue so let the babies be great break down the bare essence and build upon styles that s dope and brand new let no man put asunder to what the bronx create manhattan make brooklyn take and peace to queens too cause the strength of any nation always been the babies let em learn from the elders that was strong and smart so hip hop ll be the music

this song but i m just speakin my truth cause i heard it sets you free and my conversation s with god even though he speaks through me i m smarter cause of my daughter and i m not too dense i m 28 years old it just now started makin sense and i ve been  i ve been searchin so long i admit that i ve been lost in them clouds i m just tryna stay strong baby you know i mma make you proud i know life is full of contradictions i m tryna become a better man prayin for redemption each and every day searchin so long lost in the clouds tryin to stay strong and make you proud make you proud took me some time now i see he resides in me repeat 2x minus ad libs what you just heard is real life it s real life for you it s real life for many it s about where you been yet at the same time you ay you find yourself in the midst of conflict and turmoil yes i m talkin to you in the midst of conflict and turmoil cause you realize hey it s time to change right now and in the middle of that i wanna say this the bible says that when i was a child i spoke as a child i understood as a child i fought as a child hey but when i became a man i put away those childish things did you not know that your environment has shaped you where you were born in the projects in the ghettoes in the upper downtown wherever it was the people around you the things around you cause you to do strange things because you were seeking to learn but what you learned was on the streets and not in the book god called you a prophet when you open up your mouth everything of god comes out and it commands attention it commands change i m talking about the power that s inside of you and in the midst when you re starting to understand that i caught the wrong message and now it s time i m hearing from god what amazing experience as you hear from god he said is there forth any man be in christ he is a new creation old things are passed away somebody needs to hear that and behold everything becomes new and when everything becomes new in you it s time to stop the killing i said it s time to stop the stealing it s time to stop disrespecting our women it s time for us to come home and raise our children it s time for us to really mould our communities it s time for us not to get hooked up in religion but to get hooked up in relationship with god and the amazing thing about it is wherever you find yourself right now you can confess and you can tell god i m sorry i had the wrong cue i was doing the wrong thing i was going after things that i thought were right but it wasn t right and now that i m getting it right i m asking you to forgive me and i may have done the things that they said i did but i m not who they say i am i am who you made me to be and i m changing in that and it takes a few moments but every time i fall down i ll get right back up and every time i make a wrong turn i ll get myself back in line because i recognize i have been called for such a time as this you can t resist the change and you re not condemned by your yesterday if you can grab hold of your now and move in your destiny move change and be now searchin so long lost in the clouds tryin to stay strong and make you proud make you proud took me some time now i see he resides in me 1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the wish we grow on and on the times that we might make it whisper into my soul love don t forsake me

so turned on that she had to shower twice how ironic it would be some fight that turned into a homicide that ll alter their life see mike at 32 was still on the scene had a son 15 that he never saw twice sure he saw him as an infant but he disowned him like if that was my son he would look much different see i m light skinned and that baby there s dark so it s mama s baby papa s maybe mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets had his old reliable 38 gun in his reach it s been fourteen years him and isis ain t speak he runnin around like life s a peach til one day he approached this thug that had a mean mug and it looked so familiar that he called him young cuz told him get off the strip but the boy ain t budge instead he pulled out a newer 38 snub he clearly had the drop but the boy just paused there was somethin in this man s face he knew he seen before it s like lookin in the mirror seein his self more mature and he took it as a sign from the almighty lord you know what they say about he who hesitates in war he who hesitates is lost he can t explain what he saw before his picture went blank the old man didn t think he just followed his instinct six shots into his kin

you came for the 4th 3rd i chris columbus three words from stevie for the issue the only thing to call it was official the way i live for you was as if i d die with you cause not a moment i spent with you was artifical the plan from the dome was to build a home with you forever had a space in my heart i roam with you hypothetical dreams conjure when i met you see years grew between us and still i can t forget you regretting how i ever let you let me let you escape fool s paradise running from a paradox living like a pair of ducks but with different flocks with different destinations our ships remain docked temporary but the feelings that i harbor still wade in the holy waters that made our sweet lemonaid too dumb to persist too smart to persuade too heavy to push aside and too strong to stay too hard to work and so easy to play like chopsticks what i picked slipped away leaving me to recollect day by day and take solace in the words bill say memories take you back to the good times when it s over and sad times disappear memories take you back to the lean times in between times to the days of yesteryear memories are that way  memories are that way that way back to that way back when i could never think of you and say wack similar to old cassettes something to cuss at deteriorating with each rewind and playback even now under the hiss i reminisce on this angelic face reciprocating bliss with the radio low your feet anchored in mine hands to waistline walking to a bassline good food in my belly good love on my mind turn around to a kiss deep enough to stop time open up to a smile so bright i go blind to the suffering of the world everything appears fine poetry in the bed literally you putting me open to stephany and giovanni with legs entwined trading profound lines linens fingers and spines aligned digging in your mind like it s mine sometimes at night it seem so damn right just to shift nose to neck just to get a whiff i ve never seen life like this so life like this is how i d like my life to subsist but somewhere in between us were interpretations of justice and jesus cultures in said nations but if i woulda knew what i know now mighta never known how memories take you back to the good times when it s over i searched a thousand skies before you came and in the morning when the world is new the lonely turn away as i turn to you beside me the greatest story ever erased could never replace the worst torture ever i faced was trying to retrace the steps in my mind like a defeated surgeon fighting fate with the cure just a little too late we went from yo who s that to hi my name is jay to hoping i would run into you in the hallway to that s my homegirl peace queen how ya been to lemme get your number damn do i have a pen from may i speak to to peace to who s this to hey to hear the joy in your voice i call you every day the vcr blue screen lit the dark room miles and gil quiet nights that was our tune but friday s dates and saturday s prayer lead to sunday s break up and monday s make up as just friends up until tuesday s wake up together again in a cycle that never ends my young heart coulda swore love transcends but two turntables alone don t make a blend the tracks are too different for ifs buts and sos but if it s so right never mind we both know sometimes i wonder if you married my replacement equally old with ideas adjacent you build a whole nother story to your dream house kept my possessions in a box in the basement i still consider you a song bird singing in the open cage guilded with fools gold but that s just me there ll never be no animocity i m thankful for the memories all i ask is that you remember me in the silence of the city night when the lonely watch the sky in yearning i at rest lie in peace beside you i searched a thousand skies before you came and in the morning when the world is new the lonely turn away as i turn to you beside me and in the quiet of the afternoon when the lonely roam i turn beside and you are with me still i roamed a thousand miles before you came","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"picture me going out i know what a hoe about tryna glow off the next man s

just for a moment and i spend it all without realization i have to go back i have to go back it s not fair i wish that time would stop for me just this once but it never will so run it off i m still here i know you re waiting for me past the doorway and if it s you that s haunting me say something and if it s you that s haunting me say something if it s you that s haunting me just speak i ve come this far with a different map in each of my hands they re drawn completely from memory one takes me home one takes me nowhere in particular i always seem to pick the path with all the shortcuts open and the lines and the circles more steadily drawn i always seem to say the things that i had promised i would leave unspoken and act surprised when they come tumbling out into the air and sounding wrong i never thought of what would happen if i ever found the gate closed tethered in rusted thread and iced over blue and grey from the cold but the gate holds allowing entrance to the wind and smaller leaves and i am stuck now homebound can i turn back is it too late is there some place i belong is there any place to call a home i guess there s only one real way to know is this the only way as shallow as the water is it swallows me and i can t stop looking at the world around me solemnly as we stand here in the fallen leaves will you promise me just promise me that no matter what the weather s like you ll follow me follow me and no matter what i say you ll take it honestly honestly to heart i ve got a long way to go and if i do it alone i won t make it the call of the void is coming from the balcony l appel du vide so now i let my fate take over and as i sink into the consequence below this is how far we go this is how far we go so now i let my fate take over and as i sink into the consequence below this is how far we go this is how far we go face forward falling straight for the pavement mouth open catching death just to taste it twist my body to align with the stars this is my favorite part this is my favorite part suspended close to earth but very far this is my favorite part once we touch the ground we forget who we are i guess i finally had the courage to go away the promises we made were made hollowly sometimes you d reassure me we d be okay but you d always leave3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"come between us in our language we stand off underneath it
