climbed out my tent i didn t see you assumed you were sleeping immediately start a fire cause it s freezing i can t believe we went camping in the cold i m in the wilderness standing in some snow a late start but we can still catch up you need to wake up we should eat and then pack up that s when i noticed your foot prints the snow s fresh and those have been put since what you re already up making the rounds so where you at now you laid back down the breeze came and it stalled out the flame while i went to your tent and called out your name you didn t answer so i opened up the flap it s just an empty sleeping bag and your backpack i m looking at your tracks and you took a couple laps around the campground and hoofed down the path i figure you ll return no concern i mma hold put and try to make this cold wood burn the wind is blowing strong minutes rolling on it s going on at least a half an hour you ve been gone it ain t right start the paranoia i left the camp site to go and search for ya i read the trail your feet made each step was deliberately placed it looks like you know where it leads but i see nothing but leafless frozen trees about a quarter mile into the course another set of tracks appeared next to yours from the north it came out of the thick woods and those footprints belong to a big wolf trying to find service on my cellphone i felt aight with my knife on my belt though i hope the wolf is intimidated by you i wondered if you even knew what was behind you stalking ya maybe watching ya waiting for the opportunity to hop on top of ya salivating wanna take ya to the stomach in the cartoons you would have turned into a drumstick  and it gets about as bad it goes cause i notice there s a new set of tracks in the snow i understood it doesn t look good your fan club doubled now you ve got another wolf and the odds are in favor of the home team why d you walk off all alone where you going it ain t the right time to complain but it feels like i m trying to find your remains your foot prints grew further apart i knew what that meant and it was hurting my heart it means you started to run so i did the same now my breaths looking like a steam engine train suddenly your tracks dip off of the path and so did theirs so my knife i grabbed into the forest expect the worst adrenaline burst disturbed the nerves 50 yards into the woods and brush it got so thick that it looked like dusk the air stood serene sober it seemed like a good 15 degrees colder and i ll admit hell yeah i felt fear the sound of my heart beat was all i could hear looking at the snow it was plain and clear there was a third set of wolf prints where yours disappeared i can t process i don t follow it would be easier to believe that you were swallowed with no sign of death no sign of struggle no signs of blood no signs of trouble and the wolves never stopped the tracks kept going and i took off so i don t know how your story ends but i know i ll never go into those woods again it s not that tragic it s not a shame you re not the hunted you re not the aim you just another dog with hunger pains i was so afraid that you d become the game i forgot to worry

when its time but i ll still love you when your parents die and when my parents die and were forced to face this world together terrified someday well be on our own with our bags packed walking out our childhood homes and i ll be carrying mind states to carry in mine youll be hysterical staring up at the stereo crying if all i ever wanted was too soon endeared then i long to be forgotten and my roots stripped bare i looked for answers on the posters in my room this year they told me stop youre being too sincere this is for the girls that ive kissed who are named after cities shelby berlin and madison chelsea lily and tippy we made a big city vow that we once cleared to never let our country sides keep us here but we just buried a boy who used to laugh in my car when we gutted up packs of cigars in vanishing factory yards so like the poetry you draft on your arms we werent wrong the world had to be ours we re taking the ages we changed and we re breaking our vows we prayed for the rain at the lake when we came there to drown we were power line conquerors but one day they chained us down yeah there were one too many days when i just wanted out i just wanted out these are the best fears of our lives my glory years left as wild as they came all my friends moved west they got tired of the rain how can you pack your bags when you dont know who you are i hope los angeles is beautiful and treats you all like movie stars with its skin deep wish my anemic blood brother you did me big dear pat i ll have your back until youre big needless i still believe that you gon be the next springsteen kid im not proud of it how can i walk down on the mountains of forced ground in the valleys of lost solaces every day the armor on my heart lives on surrounding me i promise i ll thank god that i finally got out of it let the music be my hospital room let the girls next door sing their gospel tunes from a college dorm room i have not improved i think we all live our lives with a lot to lose right here and the best fears of our lives can all come true if we let them when all our heroes have died and we all become legends the best fears of our lives will disappear when its time but ill still love you when your parents die and when my parents die yeah ill still love you when our parents die were taking the bridges we built and were breaking them down we were thieves of convenience store castles in paper made towns yeah our parents all broke up and one day repainted the house and there were one too many days when i just wanted out i just wanted out these are the best fears of our lives my grandfathers face looked like a grandfather clock there in the hospital the whole family watched as the student nurse fixed the medicine box because it was beeping all day now the pressure inclines forget the evidence ive never been the adventurous kind give me sentences send in a sensitive sense of denial lets not be selfish we have the rest of our lives to follow where our bucket lists will cave our ships and know we died laughing when we break our ribs with the dartboard shining where the brakecar kids turn to skeletons who only work in graveyard shifts when we re overdue lying on our deathbeds painted gold and blue we ll see the reason for the things we re going through my grandfather says this country beat a great depression and so can you nowheres as perfect as places that wait to be found i hide from the future instead does that make me a coward so when i end up in a highwayside grave unannounced i ll still believe that somehow someday we ll make it out we will make it out these are the best fears of our lives these are the best fears of our lives now i need roses so i can bid farewell to whats passed away now i need roses so i can bid farewell to

while thinking very hard to return once more to the earth he had been assigned and a single gift for all of man he was to leave behind but this gift that he was to leave could not be taken from the heavenly court and how could he leave something behind if nothing could be brought now this was quite a puzzle and he knew not how to start when he suddenly felt a prayer from a child reach deep into his heart and though his time was limited to this one night of the year he could not ignore this child s request so he decided he would start here for though this night was christmas eve and dreams were all about somewhere down below on earth he had felt this child begin to doubt a child who should have been asleep instead was climbing attic stairs with her solitary candle and a single christmas prayer now when angels they are called they rarely just appear but more often than not they gently whisper in one s ear and when they whisper to a child on nights when snow still glistens the chances are much stronger still that that child will listen so in this room where shadows live and ghosts that failed learn time forgives welcome friends please stay awhile our story starts with one small child who spends this night in an attic dark where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts now if you wonder why this child is here with all asleep and christmas near she s come up here to look for truth in this place closest to the roof for she had heard from friends who feel that nothing on this night is real that no adults truly believe in all these things of christmas eve this night that seems to cast a spell in the same world just tinseled well and as she lay in bed that night she wondered if they might be right and she wondered then who she might ask about this question that had been cast for adults she had been told you are part of this conspiracy but in her mind becoming clear the shadow of a child s idea there was one whose presence alone would reconfirm what she had known but this man he was so rarely seen for he only arrived when children dreamed but if what she had believed was right he should appear this very night so on this night with so much at stake she s determined that she would stay awake but then a problem came to mind it seems that fate had not been kind for their chimney had been closed that year some bricks might fall her father feared so she had devised another plan to hear when on the roof he lands so with the ghosts left here by fate upon this night she sits and waits now as i m sure you all must know when one is waiting time moves slow and as she wondered what to do the angel caused that child to look behind a yellowed pile of books among those memories disguised as junk she noticed there a well worn trunk it was filled with toys and one old wreath and several letters underneath it was filled with toys and one old wreath and several letters underneath some ornaments a hand rung phone and records with a gramophone a mix of long forgotten words with melodies no longer heard all threads of long forgotten lives but here somehow they had survived these letters that had caught her eye now in her hands they seemed alive and as each letter she unsealed a small piece of the past was revealed for christmas weaves a lifelong spell and most of all remembers well and as the child explored the past once again that spell was cast and as the child began to read upon this night of christmas eve the angel s plan as you can tell it was already working well so as the ghosts gently arise in our first song we ll summarize in this room where shadows live and ghosts that failed learn time forgives welcome friends please stay awhile our story starts with one small child who spends this night in attics dark where dreams are stored like sleeping hearts and so it s here that they must wait till someone wishes them awake for somewhere on this night of nights she s looking to believe here among the ghosts on christmas eve and there near an old looking glass there was a trunk from christmas past that she had somehow missed before but now decides she will explore twas filled with toys and one old wreath and several letters underneath so as the evening hours leave the child sat down and started to read for somewhere on this night of nights she s looking to believe here among the ghosts on christmas eve on christmas eve

race and he wants us to believe this world that he sees what is the dream of this night why does it echo forever here in the cold at the end of this year and with all our different lives why do we

the night of our dear savior s birth now you all heard the story about bethlehem how the child was born and the three wise men heard the preacher tell it like the preacher does but let me tell you children that s not how it was now you might ask me what i m talking about but i know the part that they all left out yes i do now do you hear what i said that herod wanted those wise men dead but on that blessed evening my great great great great great great granddad he saved those kings now granddad made his living playing jazz you see but jazz wasn t big around one a d so he got himself a job in the palace band where he heard about three kings in the desert sand let me tell you children that at any time three kings in the desert that s a real rare find yes it is but herod heard of it too and when he heard his curiosity grew so he asked those kings to drop by and my great great great great great great granddad he wondered why so the magi told old herod that they had come here to find a newborn king of kings who d heal our sins then old herod told his guards to follow those magi and that the only king around here was gonna be him then he told his soldiers as i recall when they found that child to kill them all but granddad overheard what herod said and he had to act fast or else they d all be dead yes they would so granddad got to those kings filled them in on the plan told them everything when they heard what he had in store they grabbed the gold the frankincense the myrrh the jewels the desert tents and when they found his plan was sound they followed granddad out the back door yes they did they followed him down and what a night it must have been but when god is on your side you kinda know that in the end you re gonna win they traveled fast they traveled far and in the end they found that they were standing with the child beneath the star hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and so you see we ve reached the end of our story when granddad and the kings reached that stable on the hill and while i said that three kings in the desert is a rare sight angels singing in the desert that s far rarer still now i ain t sayin that the bible was wrong but ya see the whole tale would have taken too long cause way back then in the promised land every copy they sold it had to be written by hand and granddad lived a long life stayed friends with those kings and found a good wife and eventually i came along but that my children that my children that s another song the next letter included a receipt for one toy stuffed bear donating it to a small thrift shop but somehow it was left there for attics have their secrets and toys will have theirs too like who once held or loved them when they last were new whether they were made of metal or they were cotton stuffed of how they had been left here when they were not enough and so it s here that they must wait between reality and dream hoping all will be remembered and that all can be redeemed then in the sound of the wind whistling through a door she thought she heard the sound of children that had held this toy before and she then thought to herself as she now held it in her hand that no one could save all the world but we should save who we can so she placed it near her candle for she had decided in her mind that when she left this attic he would not be left behind","artist_name":"Trans-Siberian Orchestra"},{"lyrics":"he believed in the things that he always thought he knew and had done all the

each little hoof as i drew in my hand and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a

wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying

the most are green the whole year round green the whole year round green the whole year round the holly yew and the ivy tree are green the whole year round when summer comes and the days are hot and the birds are full of song in the quiet shade of that leafy glade that is where my heart belongs for i know whenever i look for you that is where you can be found as you take your ease neath your favourite trees that are green the whole year round green the whole year round green the whole year round the holly yew and the ivy tree are green the whole year round but the summer fades and the days grow short and the autumn winds they blow and the leaves of gold come tumbling down to the forest far below memories of other days come tumbling from the past to remind us like the seasons do that life goes by so fast the winter lays her fingers cold on dark and lonely nights but christmas it will soon be here to usher in the light and when morning breaks and the bells ring out it is such a joyous sound to hear them echo in the trees that are green the whole year round green the whole year round green the whole year round the holly yew and the ivy tree are green the whole year round

was a little hippie boy i must have been twice his size his appearence typified his strange breed gaudy clothes long stringy hair hanging down i d seen perhaps a thousand in my early trips to town as he walked beside me on down the block i noticed no unpleasing smell he might have been on the weed or even lsd but if he was i couldn t tell so we walked together that way through this neighborhood finally he turned around to me and he said friend you know we re a million miles apart but you know something we can enjoy the sunshine and the weather so why don t we put our differences aside and just talk to each other you see this box beneath my arm to you it s plain it has no charm but to someone dearest to my heart this box has played a tragic part this little one can t tell you himself about his life and how he died but if anyone else could speak for him i guess i m qualified this boy was in chicago he didn t know why he was there he was with his family and friends and he didn t really care you might have been one of those who saw the struggle there on your television screen the tragic thing is so much else happened that no one else could have seen a stranger handed this boy a dollar to do a simple chore to carry a package to a nearby hotel and when he returned he d get two more but when he came back he sort of lost his way walking thru the crowd one of them things you ask yourself how the lord allowed but when he was found he was like he is now dreaming sweet and still and in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill now you can take that dollar get four cents on it compound it quarterly at any downtown bank so they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb well what i m going to tell you now you can stay or you can leave you kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing it s the same for any hippie bum or hillbilly out on the street just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat now could you help us sing this song please

other night and it brought tears to my eyes cause i d just seen the italian film youth where his song played five or six times the love song onward chris squire was the starship trooper the angelic songbird brought down by leukemia i heard i remember spinning the yes album with my childhood friend christopher who was battling leukemia too and losin his hair we were in his brother s bedroom hanging out with his older brother spinnin i ve seen all good people and your move over and over that green album and learning to play guitar became my obsession while everyone else was trapping muskrats and shooting winchesters and remingtons christopher died a year later the last time i saw him we were smoking laced reefer some crazy guy was chasing us with a baseball bat and christopher and i just laughed a warm sunny memory a stringer full of fish it wasn t long after he was killed by a bus a divine intervention cause he was losing the bout and losing his voice he refused to suffer in a hospital cause he just wanted to live like everyone else and have fun and hang out went to his memorial and his brother was a drunk angry mess he was crying and kicking and out of his mind and threatening to kill us so the next morning we returned to christopher s grave the same graveyard where he and i used to drink bud light all day but on went my life and i bought all the yes albums yeah even the ninety nine cent cut out bin tormato and i saw yes back in ohio then at the warfield in san francisco and jon anderson had so much energy he was jumping around and hitting every note but when we came home my girlfriend learned it was some other guy they found on youtube from ontario we were pretty far back that shows you what i know years later i got a call from director paolo sorrentino he loved the song onward he said it was a great american ballad and i said no it s by chris squire and he shrugged like whatever and puffed his cigar and he flew me out to switzerland and he filmed me playing the song all day long me singing onward to some extras and michael caine out on a lawn and for everyone out there who never heard it trust me onward is a great love song i finally got to see paolo s film on a day off in milan the main theme of the soundtrack was that dreamy old love song the movie was dubbed in italian and steve shelley fell asleep but thank god for onward because they cut all my other scenes i think of john paul jones and john entwistle and the great bass players of that time but the guy who cut through like no other guy was the guy who played as rick with a pick chris squire and i laid in bed and i thought of those old albums close to the edge and relayer and going for the one and fragile the last one yes ever made was heaven and earth if heaven is real then none belong there more than chris squire and my long lost friend christopher1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"hello how are you and who are you and i m glad we met hello you re dangerous it s clear that

someone read some usa news off their phone three killed in lafayette louisiana in a movie theater another fucked up day in america and we looked off to the left at the adriatic sea and with us the sonic youth s first record and bob marley and tenacious d s the pick of destiny beautiful hotel last night and my room looked over the pool and i say good morning around 11 am to marsha and neil and now it s late at night in vasto and from my hotel i hear cars along the highway and some noise from down below an italian wedding it won t go away it s like a sauna here we took a cold jacuzzi and no airports today these last few drives have been beautiful fields of sunflowers along the way i picked some roma tomatoes from a farmer s garden i ate them in the van and invited a child up on stage and i sang while i held her little hand told her to quit eating sweets that they were bad for her teeth took the gum from her hand and put a piece in my mouth and it was really sweet and i invited some guys up on stage cause they had ants in their pants and this is my first day and i m indian and i work at a gas station and they danced and they danced we played the weeping song for nick cave and his family the passing of his son has been a daily thing on my mind since arriving at heathrow and my guitarist had told me now the cars keep blowing down the highway and the guys are out at the festival watching james blake but i got a ride back i would ve stuck around if i was still 28 but i m older now and i can t handle being out that late and that s an account of my last few days and oh yeah i saw a skinny black cat by the sea and i called for him and he dashed away that s an account of my last few days and marsha took photos of us by the sea and we laughed and then we played that s an account of my last few days and i made the promoter put the barricades closer to the stage and that s an account of my last few days and i ve been doing 40 push ups and 150 sit ups every single day and that s an account of my last few days and we ate cheese pizza late at night in a wine cellar and we got in our van and we drove away today we all had a nice dinner with our driver francesco i asked him how many cups of coffee he drinks a day and he said many many many many cappuccinos and a group of fans came into the restaurant and their eyes popped out of their heads i asked them to join us and we all shook their hands they sat down at the same time they all said wow and the waiter explained every type of pasta the restaurant had in great detail one looked like a bowtie and one looked like a wheel we all had a nice dinner me the band the fans and marsha and neil and we all went out to the sea a rare day off for the band and me and i went so far out that i could no longer feel the sand under my feet and i dove down and i touched the bottom and i swam back to the shore soaked up the sun and came back to the hotel room red as a lobster there were a ton of emails mostly business but there was one that really touched me that was forwarded to me by robert my publicist from a girl named tanya okay i m gonna read it here in just a minute  hi robert this is just a thank you note to sun kil moon after a truly memorable gig in manchester i m hoping you can pass it on i ve never done this before written a letter to people who i admire before but having seen you play at the rnc in manchester last week i really just want to say thank you i ve loved the sound of your voice mark since the mid 90 s when i first heard grace cathedral park at 17 it really hit me the tone of your voice the sadness of your and it felt real and honest whilst i suppose i ve dipped in and out of your music as people tend to do but the recent years of sun kil moon have pulled me right back in and my car journeys are usually accompanied by one or another of your albums i ve always wanted to see you play live but i ve always heard too late about the few gigs you ve played near me so the manchester gig was a big deal for me a type of one day i ll get to hear thoughts you have and hope will happen i ve seen so many of my musical loves in the last 30 years and you were one of the few outstanding but one of the most important i also got to share it with my husband and my baby growing inside of me reacted with lots of kicks and movement which made it even more personal for me when i close my eyes at the concert and listen it s not so much that it took me back as the music has moved on and is even more honest and raw i suppose but your voice was undoubtedly the same no gimmicks just the tone which hasn t changed over the years it was beautiful that is the harmonies with the band the atmospheres you all created and how it just felt so special throughout so i just want to say thank you all it touched my soul and inspired me as only good music can do i m sure you get lots of these messages and they lose their significance for you over time and if so that s fine natural even i guess as the years have passed but in case it lifts your spirits or gives you any form of pride in what you ve collectively achieved i wanted you to know thank you tanya from sheffield
