get upset and since you left look at all the shit that it affects i take a picture of your face and i just hold it up kiss it then reminisce on when it was both of us it s hard for me to open up i m always talking to myself but to nobody else some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help but they don t know about all of my idiotic lies all the fucking times i left you traumatized swore up and down to you saying i ma try and never did i try not to cry but i feel bad i didn t apologize it s time i cough it up and tell more my soul is taken never sell yours i did some shit i probably coulda been in jail for bury me deep inside hell s core and don t let me out until you hear bells roar she said you never loved me you just controlled me if you fuck around i m calling the police but all i wanted to say was i m sorry oh how i wish that could tell you you re gone you re dead you ll never know that i was sorry just leave me alone stay out my head i wish that i could tell

that you were smarter than this the mess i put you through was worse than pearl harbor and shit i d always harm you and flip mentally scar you and trip sometimes i d argue and get the nerve to call you a bitch then bruise your back against the dresser that i tossed you against my juliet at the time i never thought you was it i do now but shit you re gone so i just offer you this a song to you through it i open the crack in my chest and show the whole world i ve always had a lack of respect for women who enter my life i look to vengeance as knife intentions to fight if you thinking i was senseless you right now every sentence i write i think twice on it so i don t regret cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness i m an unholy mess put me in a hole to rest welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get  she said you never loved me you just controlled me if you fuck around i m calling the police but all i wanted to say was i m sorry oh how i wish that could tell you you re gone you re dead you ll never know that i was sorry just leave me alone stay out my head i wish that i could tell you you re gone you re dead you ll never know that i was sorry just leave me alone stay out my head i wish that i could tell you now use this track as a lesson all you guys out there who have some aggression towards your woman it don t have to get hectic that crap is pathetic now look at me i have to regret it i can t go near her or nothing she ll probably have me arrested the only thing i could do is just make a track with a message and hope she hears it so she could know i was badly affected i never meant to be that type of guy but i realized that i was and because of it i m throwing my sinister life aside i can cry at any moment just thinking about it sometimes i hide it from the folks that i m hanging around with i should apply for a new soul cause i think it s invalid somebody told me when i die i ll be safe but i doubt it the grudge she holds against me it hurts me so severely she won t come near me i thought that time was supposed to cure me i m so alone and weary writing songs to heal me i swear that i m sorry heather i mean it so sincerely she said you never loved me you just controlled me if you fuck around i m calling the police but all i wanted to say was i m sorry oh how i wish that could tell you you re gone you re dead

dreads but my hair was too big but i was lost i ain t know who i was what else was there to do besides look like a thug so in my senior year at columbia high i dropped out of high school when i got signed b dot o dot b was the name i ain t like bobby ray cause i was ashamed but you can call me bobby ray from this day forth and i could give a damn about the fame and fortune honestly i don t even listen to rap cause when i turn the radio on out comes crap and if you make good music that s okay but on the radio that they don t play it s easy to see we created a beast cause everybody wants to hear what they don t need and now all the rappers got to struggle to give you that bullshit music so they can continue to live the position that i m in is quite an interesting predicament i will admit but you can count on me cause i m refusing to give in cause i ma give you music cause we need it to exist bitch so i ma play my guitar rap about aliens and sing about stars til you understand that s what we are so we ain t got to struggle no more so we don t starve i swear to god i love you with every bar we all got problems that need to be solved so while i got the mic i ma speak my thoughts and i ma keep it real till the day i fall turn my music up 5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"it s all about me i think it s all about me now but i seen the light though i seen it i i definitely seen the

that was boiling in a cup and i tried to scream but had no steam and thats when i woke up when i came to i was so confused how long was i asleep the loneliness i felt right then was enough to make me weep then i heard the voice inside my head lit a fire under me it said your fear is gonna cost a lot but your courage comes for free so i thanked that little island i paddled off without a care for i know not where im going but ill know it when im there and i hope that no ones a missin me back in my home town for together we will always be even though im not around and the sea swirled by like a ballet and it sang its gentle song but a distant rumble warned me it wouldnt be that way for long so i spoke out and i told the night this lifes not only mine i am just your humble passenger and i trust your grand design by and by the clouds came lumbering through and the raindrops staggered in and the waves lined up two by two for the show would soon begin and the lightning bolts ripped through the sky like sharks that missed a meal and the wind went up so hard and cold just like a wall of steel then all at once the sea below picked me up a mile high as it threw me to the oceans

christine a voice from your past getting back in touch i m coming to new york next week i want to see you so much i was stunned i called her we laughed just like old times picked up where we both left off in 1969 talked about the passing years made plans to rendezvous aw jane it was so good to hear from you what are we doing with our lives i can see the disappointment in your eyes you look like one of those society wives jane you arrive at my apartment we laugh and hug and squeal say that we both look the same when we both know that s not for real we bring each other up to date both our dads are gone marvel at how well our moms have carried on you re not surprised at how i live you say you always knew i would not take the beaten path i had thought the same for you what happened to that little girl who bent all the rules the four year old in lipstick raising hell at that private school what are we doing with our lives i can see the disappointment in your eyes you look like one of those society wives jane you show me pictures of your second husband your horses and your kids though outwardly you re happy i suspect you re keeping a tight lid i take you to a restaurant recommended by the times we order a la carte wash it down with wine we drink a toast to 1969 your words are tumbling too fast for me to hear the past and present are colliding you look close to tears but you do not break you laugh and joke then take another sip i pretend not to see that tremble in your lip what are we doing with our lives i can see the disappointment in your eyes you look like one of those society wives jane i put you in a taxi as it begins to rain i hug you it was so good to finally see you jane you drive off i feel guilty because i know i could have probed much deeper but you said you had to go what made you place that phone call are you longing for the past are you grasping for the friendship teenagers think will last are you the girl that i remember are you the woman that i see are you as confused when you look at me what are we doing with our lives i can see the disappointment in your eyes you look like one of those society wives jane","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"random

guess but i used a little too much force we drove that car as far as we could abandoned it out west split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best she turned around to look at me as i was walking away i heard her say over my shoulder we ll meet again someday on the avenue tangled up in blue  i had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell but i never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell so i drifted down to new orleans where i lucky was to be employed working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of delacroix but all the while i was alone the past was close behind i seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and i just grew tangled up in blue she was working in a topless place and i stopped in for a beer i just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear and later on when the crowd thinned out i was just about to do the same she was standing there in back of my chair said tell me don t i know your name i muttered something underneath my breath she studied the lines on my face i must admit i felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe tangled up in blue she lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe i thought you d never say hello she said you look like the silent type then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me written by an italian poet from the thirteenth century and every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul from me to you tangled up in blue i lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs there was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died she had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside and when it finally the bottom fell out i became withdrawn the only thing i knew how to do was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew tangled up in blue so now i m going back again i got to get to her somehow all the people we used to know they re an illusion to me now some are mathematicians some are carpenter s wives don t know how it all got

thousand head or so and started them out on the trail that leads to mexico but a norther started blowing and lightning flashed about i thought someone was calling me i thought i heard a shout then at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me and left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree and this time i knew i heard a voice a voice so sweet and strange a voice that came from everywhere a voice that called my name so frightened i was thinking of sinful deeds i d done i failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run the cattle they stampeded were running all around my pony ran but stumbled and it threw me to the ground i felt the end was near that death would be the price when a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of jesus christ and i cried oh lord forgive me don t let it happen now i want to live for you alone oh god these words i vow my wicked past unfolded i thought of wasted years when another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers and the others rushed on by me and i was left to live the master had a reason life is his to take or give a miracle performed that night i wasn t meant to die the dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high and right behind it there was i afraid but safe and sound i cried and begged for mercy kneeling there upon the ground a pardon i was granted my sinful soul set free no more to
