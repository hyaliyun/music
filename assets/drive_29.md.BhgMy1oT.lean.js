a rebel with a bullet in his chest hung his rifle on my limbs and laid to rest and there beside me as the blood soaked to my roots the soldier sang a song of grace the heavy rifle bowed me over to the ground two years i stayed this way until the rifle fell and in this manner for a hundred years i grew all my dreams not meant to be and then one day two men came with a cross cut saw they spoke of how my arch would hold a weight so strong and i feared not the blade for such a worthy cause and so i fell i gladly fell three winter days aboard a northbound train three more beneath the hewer s careful blade and while he worked he praised my rich red grain perhaps it was the soldier s blood that day now i m the wooden arch that holds a mighty bell three stocks before me cracked but i shall never fail up in a tall cathedral high above my dreams of long ago and on sunday mornings when i hear that sweet refrain i see the soldier s face like it was yesterday calling angels down from heaven with that hymn he softly sang of god s good grace","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"guy 1 whats good guy 2 you still be juggin and finnessin guy 1 jugglin for nothin im much different dog i get rubber bands

you got i m used to it though i know about gold diggers they get what they want from you and dip go figures remember when we was playin that time and i messed up your clothes your foster mom took out her belt and said we couldn t play no more but she ain t know how close we was just two friends when you was 14 i almost convinced you to move in to my place when your mother s husband touched you in the wrong place but you knew that she would miss you so you stayed i knew that you d return to me i knew that you d return to me i knew that you d return to me one day as far as the distance you made me think that i had caused it only time i heard from you in school was for that science project i see that you don t talk much nowadays wow you ve changed you grew up and found your lane far as i go i m bout the same i caught you every time you fell and if it hurt i took the blame now i m not mad that you became detached from me just sad to me that tragedy is what made you come back to me it s clear you have no future so i ll remind you of your past since you ran out of time for me i ll slip through your hour glass but you was right i m no good something i m not proud of one day i get you in a hole that you couldn t get out of i wasn t a dope boy but i was good for growin trees hurt me when you walked away loved it when you noticed me i could ve helped you find your roots but you ain t wanna learn from me through all this time i knew that one day you d return to me  when you left me that was cold now that your here with me your colder you won t talk you won t speak you only gettin lower it s funny as an author you usually had a lot to say and always liked to think outside the box but not today you made me wait so long for you i think it s sinking in now that your here with me i ll never let you leave again don t worry i ll open up i ll let you inside of me and every dream you never lived i ll make sure it dies with me i can hear your family crying soon enough the noises end hope you kiss your kids goodbye they ll never hear your voice again you should ve laughed you should ve cried you should ve loved you should ve danced you should ve smiled at every living creature

and i m smaller than a poppyseed inside a great big bowl and the ocean is a giant that can swallow me whole so i swim for all salvation and i swim to save my soul but my soul is just a whisper trapped inside a tornado so i flip to my back and i float and i sing i am grounded i am humbled i am one with everything i am grounded i am humbled i am one with everything so i talked to genevieve and almost cried when she said that the giant on the cliff wished that she was dead and the lemmings on the cliff wished that they were dead so the giant told the lemmings why they ought to live instead and when she thought up all those reasons that they ought to live instead it made her reconsider all the sad thoughts in her head so thank you genevieve cause you take what is in your head and you make things that are so beautiful and share them with your friends we all become important when we realize our goal should be to figure out our role within the context of the whole and yeah rock and roll is fun

how do you prepare in a front row seat to the world premiere her burden unloaded so she talking sincere with a message for a kid that i didn t wanna hear take good care of the time left to share is no

wand of ivory cut to the length of a walking stick it is somewhat more than two inches in diameter at the top and it tapers evenly to a blunt point smooth backed ridges not more than a quarter of an inch in height spiral round it counter clockwise making about two turns and a half between one end and the other as a whole it is a twisted spear one can fancy that it has been taken in powerful hands and wrung as one wrings a wet cloth thomas fuller having seen another such ivory wand as this said excellently that to his dim eyes and at some distance it seemed like a taper of wreathed waxe this walking stick has been fitted at the upper end with a gilded silver cap which bears the arms of a certain noble house and a motto in welsh four inches below the cap a hole has been bored through the stick one would say at first to receive the cord to which some gentleman of the grand old days attached the silken tassel that adorned his cane i scarcely think however that this particular stick ever tapped its way along birdcage walk or through the gardens of versailles partly because there are no signs of wear on its point and partly because it weighs something like three pounds more probably the cord that went through this hole was used not to carry a tassel but to hang the stick against the wall in some great house of three or four centuries ago and yet i do not doubt that some of the former owners of this wand carried it about with them but when they did so they carried it neither for comfort nor display rather it was their companion on dark nights and in perilous places and they held it near their hearts handling it tenderly as they would a treasure for indeed it was exactly that it preserved a man from the arrow that flieth by day and the pestilence that walketh in darkness from the craft of the poisoner from epilepsy and from several less dignified ills of the flesh not to be named in so distinguished a connection in short it was an amulet a talisman a weapon and a medicine chest all in one small wonder that such a wand as this in the days when such things were appreciated sold for twenty times its weight in gold and that one alone as thomas dekker said was worth a city small wonder that perfect sticks like this were to be seen only in the treasure chambers of popes and emperors and kings or when some opulent church like st mark s of venice did manage to acquire one that it should be shown to the public only on gala days and beneath a pall of purple velvet the stick before me although of ivory was not cut from an elephant s tusk or even from the tusk of a mammoth or mastodon it grew as it is and according to the most learned opinion of many generations it grew single on the brow of a beast so glorious so virtuous so beautiful that heaven vouchsafed the earth as in the case of the phoenix only one specimen at a time for this is the horn of the unicorn to retrace the devious ways by which this piece of ivory so reverently handled has come to lie here on my writing desk i shall have to tell a story that ranges back through more wild centuries than we can count a story that begins with a time before cities or agriculture when barbarous tribes wandered with their herds from summer to winter pasturage and back again a tale that includes at one end the most primitive myths and the first stirrings of the moral sense and at the other the trickery of the charlatan and the mountebank into the web of this tale i shall have to catch up many strands of the history of exploration of medicine of art of commerce and of scientific thought the fact is that i cannot explain how this ivory wand came to lie before me i purchased it not long ago from a london dealer in antiques for about three guineas without indicating in one vivid example the ways by which magic rose into religious dogma and this gradually succumbed or is succumbing under the attrition of modern science but even then of course i shall fall short of a full explanation and any reader of these words who cherishes the few relics of superstition that we have left to us may be assured that this book will not murder to dissect will not substitute a dull explanation for one of the most beautiful legends in the world the remote and solitary strangeness of the unicorn is perfectly safe from me and i think from any one for even if i did not prefer to do so i should have to let him stalk away at the end into the mystery out of which he comes the lore of the unicorn is enormous in range and variety not only because of the great expanse of time it covers but because it involves so many different departments of knowledge and the literature dealing specifically with the topic is surprisingly extensive like most of my predecessors i have hunted the unicorn chiefly in libraries realizing the delightful absurdity of the task quite as fully as any one could point it out to me a zoologist would have written on my topic a different and probably a shorter book but for me the unicorn is interesting almost entirely as a denizen of the monarch thought s dominions whether there is or is not an actual unicorn and this is one of the questions upon which i shall merely quote the opinions of others he cannot possibly be so fascinating or so important as the things men have dreamed and thought and written about him a dream if it is no more than that of such great age and beauty as this of the unicorn is far more worthy of consideration than the question whether we shall have one species more or less in the earth s fauna and the dream at any rate is an unquestionable fact a phenomenon of the mind it has grown like a tree striking deep roots in thought and spreading huge boughs against our mental sky this book about the unicorn is a minute contribution to the study of the only subject that deeply and permanently concerns us human nature and the ways of human thought in view of the fact that i am tracing what has been thought and said about the unicorn and that most of the literature concerned is found in rare and forgotten books it has seemed necessary to quote more freely than would otherwise have been desirable after reading hundreds of pages of unfounded and ignorant recent writing on my topic i have no apology to make for the care i have taken to prove my points by exact citation of authority the lore of the unicorn owes much to the work of accurate scholars and i have tried to present their opinions with an accuracy they would have approved but the mere apparatus of scholarship is a scaffolding that should always be kept as much as possible out of sight and my notes will be found at the back of the book where they will trouble no one for whom they are not intended perhaps it would not be inappropriate to explain how i first struck into a footpath so far at least in appearance from any of the highways of contemporary research some time ago while reading petrarch s treatise de vita solitaria i came upon a vivid description of the noon day meal in the house of an italian tyrant in the fourteenth century like most things in petrarch s latin prose this description is derivative its main source being st ambrose s de abstinentia but a sentence or two in the middle of it stood out as a rather startling bit of personal observation among all these yellow and black and livid lumps of flesh says petrarch who was himself a vegetarian the diligent taster goes exploring for the suspected and not undeserved bit of poison but another kind of precaution has been taken against secret plots between the wines and the viands project the livid horns of serpents skilfully fastened to little gilded trees so that it is a wonder to see how death himself stands guard as it were in the very stronghold of pleasure against the death of this miserable man what the horns of serpents might be doing on a rich man s dinner table i had no idea and i determined to find out a few hours of excavation in the pages of pietro de abano ardoynus and cardinal ponzetto taught me all that i cared to know about the devices once used in italy for detecting poison at the table devices such as that of the cerastes s horn which petrarch mentions the vulture s claw the sealed earth the crystal goblet the eagle stone the snake s tongue and others of the same sort but while i read the terror of those evil times when death might lie at the bottom of any cup took hold of me and still more powerfully a sense of pity for the wild and ignorant ways in which the danger was encountered gradually however i found myself moving out into a purer air along a path not entirely strange even then for the unicorn s horn was long the chief defence against poison of those who could pay the huge prices at which it was held and then several other questions arose how did this horn acquire its great reputation how was it supposed to act in detecting poison how could it maintain its prestige while the princes and dukes of italy who owned it were dying on every hand suddenly and from no apparent cause where did these horns come from and what was the nature of the traffic that purveyed them was the belief in their powers a vulgar superstition only or was it held by learned men and perhaps even by physicians how old was this belief and what was its origin these are some of the questions i asked myself and shall try in this book to answer 1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"hung in a blinding light held in a bitter gaze feeling the crowd melt away up in the desert air miles above the world and the daggers that it holds

midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as of someone gently rapping tapping at my chamber door tis some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door only this and nothing more ah distinctly i remember it was in a bleak december and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost lenore for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore nameless here for evermore and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before presently to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door merely this and nothing more out into the darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore merely this and nothing more back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before surely said i surely that is someone at my window lattice let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore tis the wind and nothing more open wide i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door perched and sat and nothing more soon that ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering on the nightly shore tell me what thy lordly name is on this night s plutonian shore quoth the raven nevermore now the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have gone before on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before quoth the raven nevermore then methought the air grew denser perfumed by an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor once more on the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore desolate yet all undaunted on this desert isle enchanted on this home by horror haunted tell me truly i implore is there is there balm in gilead tell me tell me i implore quoth the raven nevermore prophet said i thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil by that heaven stretched above us by that god we both adore tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore quoth the raven nevermore be that word our sign in parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting get thee back into the tempest and the night s plutonian shore leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door quoth the raven nevermore now the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming and the lamplight o er him streaming
