prepare to go out for the evening they come and say goodnight to their children wendy michael and john mr darling wonders if having a dog for a nanny is such a good idea mrs darling defends poor nana the children s dog and nursemaid who has been very nervous of late one night last week while the children slept nana saw a young boy appear in the middle of the room but before she could catch him he flew out the window she was however able to grab his shadow which mrs darling tucked away in a dresser drawer while mr darling acknowledges that nana has done some good he insists that she spend the night downstairs nana barking her protests is taken from the room by liza the children s maid when things have calmed down mrs darling and her children sing a lullaby once the children are asleep a fairy tinker bell and peter pan musical fly in through the window tinker bell shows peter where his shadow is hidden peter despairs when he can t get his shadow to stick and begins to cry wendy wakes up and asks him boy why are you crying when he tells her she offers to sew his shadow back on to him peter delights in his newly attached shadow he then tells wendy about the fairies and how they are dying it seems that every time a child says he or she does not believe in fairies one more fairy dies wendy asks peter where he comes from and peter replies never never land michael and john wake up suddenly nana and liza having heard noises upstairs come in to check on the children peter and tinker bell hide while the children pretend to be asleep after they leave peter invites wendy and the boys to come with him to never never land and they all heartily accept there is just one problem how will they get there peter s solution is easy he throws fairy dust on them and telling them to think lovely thoughts he teaches them to fly act ii never land outside their underground hideout the lost boys wonder when peter will return suddenly they scream in fear as captain hook and his pirates attempt to capture them the boys scatter and hide hook is out to kill peter for he is the one who cut off hook s hand and threw it to a crocodile who now follows him about hoping for more by chance hook discovers the boys s underground hideout and now summons smee to provide the appropriate music to devise a plan for the boys demise suddenly hook hears the loud tick tock of the crocodile which has swallowed a large clock thereby warning hook that he is on his way hook and his men flee the boys are now safe but not for long out of nowhere indians headed by tiger lily approach leaving the boys alone the indians continue on their way through the forest looking for the pirates seeing a strange bird in the sky the boys shoot it down with bow and arrow when peter michael and john land they are distressed to see dear wendy with an arrow in her heart wendy is not dead however until she s well enough to move into the underground hideout the boys build a house around her in the hopes that she ll be their mother hook is so furious that the boys have found a mother that he develops a plan to kidnap wendy and kill the boys the next day the pirates have captured tiger lily and tied her to a tree while hiding nearby peter imitates the captain and orders the men to set tiger lily free the real captain shows up and is enraged at the discovery that his prisoner has been released who or what has set tiger lily free hook speaks out to this strange spirit of the forest and peter still hiding is only too happy to oblige he converses with hook using different voices peter s triumph is short lived for he is unmasked by hook peter and tiger lily escape the clutches of the dastardly hook later in the underground house the boys are effusive in their love for wendy only a jealous tinker bell wishes wendy would leave peter and tiger lily rush in from their chase together they smoke a peace pipe and vow eternal friendship tiger lily and the indians leave to stand guard against hook and his men above ground at the entrance to the house wendy asks peter to sing the boys a lullaby listening to the lullaby michael and john long to return home wendy confesses that she too is homesick she asks peter if they can fly home the lost boys wish they had parents and wendy offers hers to all of them everyone is excited at the prospect of being adopted except peter he says he won t go wendy seeing how sad he is assures him that she ll come back once a year for spring cleaning just then the pirates attack and subdue tiger lily and the indians under the impression that the indians have beaten the pirates peter sends wendy and all the boys on their way before she leaves","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"oh the joy i can see the light oh the joy i can see the light lo a burning torch

class the lights go down and it s just you up there getting them to feel like that remember the days when you used to sit and make up your tunes for love and pour your simple sorrow to the sound hole and your knee and now you re seen on giant screens and at parties for the press and for people who have slices of you from the company they toss around your latest golden egg speculation well who s to know if the next one in the nest will glitter for them so i guess i seem ungrateful with my teeth sunk in the hand that brings me things i really can t give up just yet now i sit up here the critic and they introduce some band but they seem so much confetti looking at them on my tv set  oh the power and the glory just when you re getting a taste for worship they start bringing out the hammers

a hard world and saw it fast forward shes moving for money in bars full of tourists shes moved up to massage shes happy shes in charge talking to clients adoring the silence of after the session her

discovered in the circles that i ran have been difficult and humbling some dont understand but im happiest when struggling shes not reluctant to touch its the one thing that must bring us closer together its such an important endeavour to feel tender she cant believe there are some who have never been held in their lives eight months in a boardroom three on the motorway one in a small room watching the dawn loom large over grey bricks its not sordid its sacred to open them up to the warmth of her nature its ancient she dont wanna do it forever but lets face it wages are fucked and rent is outrageous some might say that shes being degraded but she makes her own mind up knows her own morals she dont care bout how most people see it one mans certain is another mans squabble lifes to be lived not agreed with shes making her living and shes making it safely better than slaving away in an office or killing herself to fill some bosss pockets working for peanuts and making them conkers i never wanted to be anybody other than the person that i am and the things that i discovered in the circles that i ran have been difficult and humbling some dont understand but im happiest when struggling well all of us walk to our own beat and each persons rhythm is unique you cant hear somebodys tune if you count in your time you must count their time to enjoy how their mind makes its music she fell in love with a suitor his name was pete and while she was at work he got stoned and watched snooker and when she got home he cooked food for them both they were happy and close but she could feel it pulling at the threads of their tapestry unravelling all that he knew to be true hes the type to say this is reality he finds it very hard to alter his view but gradually she has felt less and less certain that his understanding would stretch and now shes got to justify all her decisions but he doesnt listen just gets upset but she in her wisdom is ready to try she thinks of his feelings she kisses his neck in the evenings tells him for them shes a sweet thing in between meetings but he has her depth and the whole of her but when hes holding her hand it feels less like her hand and more like his hand and when hes kissing her face it feels less like her face and more like his face shes become displaced is she herself or is she the girl that he wants her to be she tells him i dont want to hurt you but your judgements are heavy and theyre hurting me i never wanted to be anybody other than the person that i am and the things that i discovered in the circles that i ran have been difficult and humbling some dont understand but im happiest when struggling","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i loved you in the morning our kisses deep and warm your hair upon the pillow like a

went to sleep in day and woke again the same day we have learned to cheat the time and find the hours that the clocks cannot define now as i looked up from that stage i felt the thing that had been made and how it raged and how it raged how to explain something makes me howl and shiver to the core oh outside if it was raining then inside there d be a storm we ve got a pair of hands for climbing and a pair of knees to spring and a pair of balls for strength and a pair of lungs to sing and these limp old chords that say music is the language of us all to write these songs is to be written ah the chorus always knows what is in store and what is more the thing that sings us is the thing that makes us roar i felt that beast kiss on my neck we clapped our hands and heard them spread there was a trumpet and a call a pack of spaniards screamed for more music is the language of us all music is the language of us all music is the language of us all music is the language of us all i find it hard to speak emotional cause these things are the things that can t be said and when it struck it strikes the memory from our heads once i wrote two plays to be immortal for a night and despite the

genius when it comes to making music with ambition i m cool collected with the rhyme i directed don t wanna be elected as the king of a record just respected by others as the man with the solution an artist of the 80s came and left his contribution on wax relax there s twenty four tracks after years of rocking parties now i picked up the knack because everything that flows from out my larynx takes years of experience and bottles of beck s i cannot seem to recollect the time i didn t have sex is it real or is it memorex i m living in a city known as new york state sucker mcs gotta wait while i translate i hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads people with ambition and straight up musicians although our lives have been so uprooted i haven t included you can all get zooted so take each letter of the krs one means knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone you look at me and laugh but this is your class it s an all out discussion of the suckers i be crushing so now
