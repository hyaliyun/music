pork chops and karate chops were the same thing i thought they were both pork chops and because my grandmother thought it was cute and because they were my favourite she let me keep doing it not really a big deal one day before i realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees i fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body i didn t want to tell my grandmother about it because i was afraid i d get in trouble for playing somewhere that i shouldn t have been a few days later the gym teacher noticed the bruise and i got sent to the principal s office from there i was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home i saw no reason to lie as far as i was concerned life was pretty good i told her whenever i m sad my grandmother gives me karate chops this led to a full scale investigation and i was removed from the house for three days until they finally decided to ask how i got the bruises news of this silly little story quickly spread through the school and i earned my first nickname pork chop to this day i hate pork chops i m not the only kid who grew up this way surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called and we got called them all so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us that we d be lonely forever that we d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their tool shed so broken heart strings bled the blues as we tried to empty ourselves so we would feel nothing don t tell me that hurts less than a broken bone that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away that there s no way for it to metastasize it does she was eight years old our first day of grade three when she got called ugly we both got moved to the back of the class so we would stop get bombarded by spit balls but the school halls were a battleground where we found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day we used to stay inside for recess because outside was worse outside we d have to rehearse running away or learn to stay still like statues giving no clues that we were there in grade five they taped a sign to her desk that read beware of dog to this day despite a loving husband she doesn t think she s beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half of her face kids used to say she looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase but couldn t quite get the job done and they ll never understand that she s raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word mom because they see her heart before they see her skin that she s only ever always been amazing he was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree adopted but not because his parents opted for a different destiny he was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy started therapy in 8th grade had a personality made up of tests and pills lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs four fifths suicidal a tidal wave of anti depressants and an adolescence of being called popper one part because of the pills and ninety nine parts because of the cruelty he tried to kill himself in grade ten when a kid who still had his mom and dad had the audacity to tell him get over it as if depression is something that can be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit to this day he is a stick on tnt lit from both ends could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moments before it s about to fall and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration he remains a conversation piece between people who can t understand sometimes becoming drug free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity we weren t the only kids who grew up this way to this day kids are still being called names the classics were hey stupid hey spaz seems like each school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear do they make a sound are they just the background noise of a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like kids can be cruel every school was a big top circus tent and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers from clowns to carnies all of these were miles ahead of who we were we were freaks lobster claw boys and bearded ladies oddities juggling depression and loneliness playing solitaire spin the bottle trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal but at night while the others slept we kept walking the tightrope it was practice and yeah some of us fell but i want to tell them that all of this shit is just debris leftover when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be and if you can t see anything beautiful about yourself get a better mirror look a little closer stare a little longer because there s something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit you built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself you signed it they were wrong because maybe you didn t belong to a group or a click maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show and tell but never told because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it you have to believe that they were wrong they have to be wrong why else would we still be here we grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them we stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called we are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on a highway and if in some way we are don t worry we only got out to walk and get gas we are graduating members from the class of fuck off we made it not the faded echoes of voices crying out names will

who made a name with his rhyme style now sometime around 95 i found my calling and that all coincides with the time that i found my darling now later on in the story i tell you her significance but now let s talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see my daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns hallelujah i m the son of a addict my addiction was music all i would do is go to the studio and the shelter and listen to redman and heltah skeltah aye y all remember that one joint from the heltah skeltah album called sean price be like i m not sure any yeah that was my shit i used to bump that shit all day by this time i knew i wanted to be an artist i didn t want to be anything else you know but my mom had plans for me she wanted me to go to school so you know  uh to make mom s happy i took some general courses in college took the bus until i got hella bored with that because the bus stop i had to walk to was right across from the first studio i ever recorded at now i would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping or meant for me to be laughing at god s geographical humor as soon as i stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion i was a shoe in i met kino there too and he asked me to manage me and that was back in like let me see 97 my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent and it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my

december 29th was the day i became a believer in fate okay now it s december 28th my day has gone great kino booked me a show under contract to do that night i got a call from my girl s people saying she s in labor in the hospital right now 9th floor i get on the elevator elevator stops on the 5th floor elevator opens up my uncle s standing there crying now i m caught off guard i m like what the

s been in a bad accident and it ain t looking good i m like man what i m having a baby four floors up before i froze up i m trying to figure out why the lord chose us or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster my momma said the baby here yet i said maybe she said maybe baby go see i walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son get to my girl she 5 centimeters dilated so i waited she got to get to bout nine til it s that time and meanwhile i m more popular in this hospital than the doctors nurses watching whispering like that s the one right there who got a lady in labor on 9 and another lady dying on 5 by this time i don t even fuckin remember that i got a show somebody had to remind me the doors was already open at the venue i got emotions runnin every which way all the nurses and stuff is like we ll keep you posted about the baby we ll keep you posted about your granny i didn t like seeing my mama like that so i had to get out of there yeah i hit the stage at 11 50 killed it i got off at about midnight with about six types of different emotions floatin around inside me hopeless tryna find me hopin in time god ll guide me in the future just as i was about to leave out i saw kino talkin to marshall and then he introduced us we talked about collaboratin and how chasin this rap thing is aggravatin but i ll get back i got the family waitin i

him up looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried ain t no denyin this is the power of god i said i love you granny and looked to the sky like even though he just got here goodbye this is how the story goes powerful day powerful day most significant day in my life i mean aside from meetin my man marshall my son bein born and my granny dying on the same day my grandma didn t live anywhere near that hospital i learned a lot this day i learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out for me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny and gain such a beautiful soul

slaps you in the face with a big wet fish first thought best thought its strange to look across the desk and not seeing you there but an empty space only the soil can recognize the corn moved by the

indeed true faith in abundances making the invisible visible winds mysterious fingers play leaves like piano keys conducting shimmering shadow play after midnight before sunrise the hushing of day

trembling in awe the smell of fresh rain in the evening mini eclipse bird flight into the center of sun darkness only a fleeting moment making cracks because that s how the light gets in admiring

mistake in hip hop the car is king rappers have made household names of luxury brands such as maybach and bugatti but what of colnago or cervelo first of all forget road bikes and drop bars the bmx bicycle is the conveyance of choice sometimes slung low like harleys with high rise handlebars not surprisingly these miniature bicycles inspire considerable nostalgia in the artists who rap about them the bicycle is associated with fond memories from childhood jay z boasts how he sed to wheelie bicycles since i was six the boy on a bicycle is the starting point of the rappers story a boy on

riches trajectory as going from a 10 speed to a bentley learning to ride a bicycle is one of those pivotal mythical moments in the formation of autonomous identity and so it stands to reason that the rappers story would begin there autonomy brings potential of course but also peril as you are exposed to accidents and injuries from which you were previously protected hovas wheelies aside the bicycle is generally not a site of childhood play in rap music but an instrument of work used in low level street drug dealing and other criminal activities jeezy stashes drugs in inner tubes like the tires on my mongoose lil wayne warns that he and his crew will pop up on bicycles pop yall like spot pimples the bicycle is situated somewhat uneasily between youth and age play and work the bike is unique of road vehicles in being powered by human exertion perhaps rappers are generally not shown riding a bike because they are imagined as having transcended the necessity of physical labor an

democracy are not synonymous you swallow propaganda like a birth control pill sellin your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill but that ll never be me cause i m leavin the past like an

reality instead of what you usually learn and i refuse to be concerned with condescending advice cause i m the only motherfucker that could change my life  some people think i won t make it but i know that i will escape the emptiness cause that shit is slow and it kills the flow and the skill i made y all believe it at last you can make the future but it starts with leavin the past

of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic to pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates now you re working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus and you re willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence if nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense then do you really regret when you ve shredded your promises now i ve tested the waters kid sipped it rippled the pond a bit visits have been abolished and this shit s killing my confidence is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment if you miss chicks when they re around the phrase let s quit isn t an option you best fix whatever s wrong and just move on and get on with it cause you ll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it it s sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch when loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high cause it isn t really my time is it shit i just found the watch but hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock and i can t die without trying my hands tied in knots knowing that i ll never learn to brave the waves if i stand by the docks love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of death it s as massive a shock and to intellects it s a fuckin smack in the crotch it s a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road just use caution and know that love ain t nothing but a loss of control off then we go love ll have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit studderin utterin nonsensical shit in your verses feeling like a shirtless 4 breasted woman in a circus furtherly trying to gap an unfillable void because of parents never transferring that unbillical joy so girls create a false world of filling on boys exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys but when you have it there s nothing like it you get excited seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it living in a confusing hayes like they re grooving to isaac it ain t the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map it ain t easily learnable with definitions in tact it can ride your train of though and demolitions your tracks hittin and bullwhippin you leavin them slits in your back but i ve been a lucky one loving parents loving friends but i still spend a lot of my life loving sin but i ain t a genius on it i can only pretend cause over all it s an emotion i can not comprehend it s love love ain t the basis for action in a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction and the past isn t felt as a match made in hell but rather its held as a latter day meld of common mistakes and nice intentions but when false love retention is simply vice invention its only right to mention the fights you get in nightly visions of these tina and ike revisions so what s love really got to do with it from prude women to stool pigeons in soup kitchens the truth isn t as eloquent so be intelligent getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it s irrelevant and that word ll fit like a glove if you don t get right now live your life for the love or

just too heavy before you become my friend picnic with my rubble road trip with everyone i left in the dust do the laundry from the last time i was loaded how she found my trigger and we woke with the sheets pulled above our heads praying the mortician could make us pretty y all none of us are pretty but our ugly has an alibi and our gorgeous has a sand collection or two harmonicas we keep blowing off for that flute we carve from our wrists put your lips here tell me there is music in my blood then tell me there is more in my light hang me chandelier from the last night i believed this life had to hurt so much i am done kneeling in the church of steepled smokestacks done stargazing my own train crash give me wind sprints tell me my fingerprints are the shape of ripples on a frozen lake tell me my coal mind will never collapse on my heart ill tell you these poems they are my birthmarks and i came this close to having them removed once even kept that voice box cutter hidden in my shoe the day that flight took off but the runway its made of marble made of gust made of windmill made of salt and there is a sea of hope chest in every word i speak praying to be open by the night with its belly full yield pull the shield from my wingspan teach me why the candle wax says thank you to the flame tell me how your mother says your name like an orchard going bloom a doctor once told me i feel too much i said so does god thats why you can see the grand canyon from the moon we are a telescope a riverbed we are empty lockets melting into gold we are hearts breaking bread fold me in your napkin poem pull the tinsel from my hair from all the pasts i cannot let go my gills are adjusting to the air the story husk peeled from my bones my bones know the song of our tears dripping from the faucet tick ticking like a metronome i know there is better music even in this cabin full of fever tonight im catching nothing but the lightning bug my body is a mason jar transparent as a jellyfish i wish for a heart you can see straight through for a voice that glows in the dark and a few really good friends to skip moon rocks to 6","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"heard you re new in town want

start what better way to begin before too much of the corruption the temptation and sin before the gloss was taken off back to sand castles and grins before the world we were living in became riddled with ritalin i had a very normal birth no wise men did attend born into my family as son brother and friend i had a normal start to life with a very normal infancy and over the years many events did influence me but there s one that stands out now with a special place in my mind and the more times i think back the more new memories i find when i was four years old out in france i almost died a wave swept up to the shore and took me back for the ride and in that moment of fear i gazed below normal tide that s when the depths of the ocean showed what was really inside i saw a man sat just below the surface on a rock and his wisdom filled gaze withdrew all panic and shock and unlocked an inner calm that let me float down to his depths without any flailing shaking arms or panic filled breaths i swear we sat for hours before words were introduced just relaxing in a world below the fights and abuse below the weapons of war below the cars and the ships and then when he felt i understood he slowly parted his lips the pen is far mightier than the sword he said as he stabbed his pen in my leg and the ink mixed with the red with this action i inject the gift of knowledge instead of all the other cluttered thoughts that will clog up your head but if at any point you take the spoken word just for granted these words will stick in your mouth and fall out broken and parted it didn t hurt for some reason but i could feel a change inside but i hadn t really understood what his words had implied i thought i d wait for his next words with my mind open wide and with the guidelines that he gave me i would try to abide again much time passed with silence being the topic but the serenity was such bliss i had no words that could stop it then after what seemed like a lifetime had passed he stopped and looked right through me like i was made up of glass and at that very moment i was grabbed from this landscape as i left this wise old figure i quickly prompted a handshake and i was carried back to shore my life saved by my own dad with no memory at the time of the experience i d had and so i went on with my life these things locked up in my brain i grew up no different from the rest everything just stayed the same until one day i realised sometimes my own speech was erratic like the needle on my record would get all caught up and static and at school this affliction didnt make things too easy an easy target so the kids would sometimes laugh at and tease me i guess theres no denying this made me stand out from the rest but that kind of thing has never fazed me i just took it in jest sure the broken stammers of a youth can kind of bring some attention but the sympathy of a teacher can get you out of detention and this continued until i reached a certain age until i started to thrive for knowledge for every word and every page all of a sudden the words would just flow off of my tongue when i got bored of how one sounded i d just learn a new one i started listening to all these people who showed great use of each word feeling the buzz from every single line from gil that i heard the way he manipulated the language and really made it develop as he told another story from 125th street and lenox and mr mojo risin the american poet had enraptured my mind with words and would never know it i would sit in my room for hours just listening out for every underlying meaning in the words he would shout then i d put on the specials to hear their social commentary you couldnt help but get drawn in sometimes even involuntary and the way that rakim would take my mind on a journey to a kind of lifestyle and scene that never used to concern me a completely different world to the one that i lived in but i could connect to the language and the passion within him so i started to write inspired by those here before me i d found an outlet for thoughts a way of telling a story so i wrote and i wrote until i felt it was time to put some of this stuff on tape and then i started to rhyme once i d started climbing i knew there was no way i could slip and that was the one true birth of this here scroobius pip the one with the leather ties and weathered eyes who s thirty seven clever lines left thirty seven severed minds the one that speaks but never lies and sometimes fails but always tries and the more he writes the more he finds it pays to bleed between the lines they say a pictures worth a thousand words so with these thousand words i ll paint a picture in your mind that breaks the rule of thirds they say a pictures worth a thousand words so with these thousand words i ll paint you one big picture in your mind that breaks the rule of thirds1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i ve been writing on your ghost page babe
