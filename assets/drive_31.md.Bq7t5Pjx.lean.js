gazed upon the city lights we each laughed aloud one final time and agreed this is one thing we ll miss and as we held our breath and forced our will the minutes stopped the air was still and minds began to unlearn their faulted ways we blasted through the hills they were the first to go and the most painful so because we made them first when we learned to bleed with our fingers on the seeds that sowed in the dirt and then cried when we came in the glorious masterwork of life ending and beginning again we ignored the pleas of the forest and the seas as we scorched the earth with our tears

weeks forever changin the expression of my thoughts when i speak it was because of her i even deaded all of my freaks she convinced me to stop hangin out on the streets to stop robbin and stealin from

my feelings was true i couldn t live without her so i told her facin my fears but honey s only response was a face full of tears she could only sob hysterically holdin me tight i tried to speak but

hold tight to your love cause you never know i went on with my life college and my career ended up locked up like an animal for a year where the c o s talk to you like they were the overseer then i got sent to the hole when my exit was near at night in my cell i d close my eyes and i d see her hold her close in my dreams but when i woke she disappeared just an empty cell until the state gave me parole in the summer came back intact and on track but the fact of the matter is i still felt cold even after my mother hugged me cryin at home my real niggas would catch me thinkin outta my zone fuckin lots of different women but i still felt alone relatively well known around the new york underground but i kept thinkin of her and how we used to be down the sound of her voice and the

probably be dead but when you left in 97 a part of me went to heaven i thank god at least i got to know what love really was but it hurt me to see what true love really does cause even though we never made love you were all that there was it was because i loved you so much that i had to make you leave you made me doubt the way i thought you made me want to believe and then i slipped up and i let

hope didn t exist for me since late in 1993 i died a virgin i wish i could ve given myself to you i cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you promise that you ll meet me in paradise

embraced she looks out of the window it s a lovely day outside she tells herself that things are fine he pulls the sheets to cover his eyes the essence of the fresh air that garden held the love affair thinking back their minds are torn in muddle and confusion so far away another sits who tries to make the best of it he don t know quite what s hit him it s another love illusion he gazes in his empty room eyes fixed upon her picture the loneliness dejectedness god how the fuck he s missed her his eyes turn turn to the window the military roar by he wonders how much hatred could evolve out of the sky what god had done for peace on earth what man destroyed from day of birth they are concerned with feelings they re just ashamed to cry and one mans plan to push the button makes other sacrifice the serenade is dead and now the only question s why why when we are young we re told it s right to love told it s human nature and that comes from god above as time moves on we realize that we all look from the pit while a plan hangs above us to keep us in the shit because the minute we are born we re told what s right and wrong raised with certain morals never mentioned in their songs as we grow up we find out that the paths been neatly set in a world of such destruction we only can regret regret that is the word of it as we look for our way out of it why can t they understand we don t want any part of it the pain they create everyday that just ain t gonna go away we ve got to stick together but still you re asking why the system stands strong as our movement starts to crumble the pressure we once held has just turned into a rumble they ve got us where they want us and you all just accept that well don t you think it s time we started to hit back they are the enemy they want a rope around your neck and if they will go that far then what the fuck is next forget the revolution we ve heard it all before heard all of the promises of nineteen eighty four it s an

don t start climbing pretty soon it ll be over my head we all have dreams of leaving we all wanna make a new start go and pack a little suitcase with the pieces of our hearts all those worries and those sorrows we can just dust them away buy a coffee and a paper and go step on to a train but i ve been too long wandering limping around this town with everything that s pulling me it s pulling me further down go make all your excuses go say all your goodbyes but take a look in the mirror it s the hardest one you ll ever find all those worries and those sorrows you can just dust them away go and find a new tomorrow and forget about your yesterdays so you and pat your kids and kiss your dog goodbye leave the keys on the nail with the sadness that s in your eyes  maybe tomorrow today looks

are like its none of your business all that you have isnt bad when its pushed to max and im asking for more when youre spent and collapse its frame switching lanes like im ditching my car throwing you out of your own set of doors ive made it longer than favorites of yours i dont run the museum but ive taken the tour deal with for real you are wasting your skills as a person for cursing my name on a hill till your back is broken in pieces someone will fill the position your reaching fight to the end youll be praising the sun like the people who know where we sampled this from grabbing my nuts isnt easy with both hands im holding two boulders as close as a slow jam might get a kick out of hearing that line so do i but i laugh cause it hurts all the time going forward the awkward moment is over if nobody told you we got more exposure words that ive wrote spilling out like theyve had it im at it beyond that i think that im rapping im for the chosen few who know the rules of show and prove who care to hold the truth anywhere the flow is used youre my neighbor its nothing but flavor the drums they can change my behavior its major id carry a friend like a soldier to safety in

drink a glass a water instead buying more things that you cant afford you need to dust off that cardboard mat of yours i break them off with the microphone my hand is on as if im swinging from the chandeliers like theyre handle bars im from another avenue its only natural that my mentality is shatterproof with the right attitude framework im who they try to forget going overboard like your feet were dry in cement and im probably on the shallow end for calling this deep thought but things have chewed me up inside ive needed to eat smart youre camouflaged blending in with the amazon while im jumping in a pool of sharks yelling cannonball dont be surprised if im not as upset watching grown men crying over piles of debt no longer waiting for your chaos behavior to out weigh my own thoughts of communication cause isnt it all quite a spectacle to make the impossible possible im after your jaws on the floor when it happens shrugging it off like i heard people clapping this is as happy i get when im asking if you can turn words into strength into passion what more could you want from a day out of breath recording a song till your dripping with sweat im absurd every word in a verse is determined to learn how you work like youre closing my curtain whether you dance or you stand and watch even though i never ran the block i damage spots im way past creating to feel like im naked exposing myself and not sure what im thinking made the wrong choices so many of times yet dont think that im bad boy ready to die and ive made up my mind if im taking a fall growth is what comes from
