being transported in a van that was picking up convicts state to state he did it during a bathroom break he hot wired somebody s pickup in fact christopher had a long history of theft involving trucks he was on route to alabama for stealing someone s travel trailer grand theft auto he was a career criminal jailbird who also had three outstanding warrants in his home state of tennessee it was an outstanding performance that set him free stole a big rig then a tour bus that belonged to crystal gayle to evade a five state manhunt that wanted to put that birdy back in jail but they failed cause christopher wasn t just running from cops christopher gay was now racing a clock his mother was dying and there was no time to be held inside of a cage with locks so yall can turn up your nose and suck on your teeth and wag your finger like tsk tsk but he had to take the risk there wasn t a single thing sinister in his decision to break from the prison his only motive was to go back to his childhood home while his mom was still living it wasn t a house more like an old mobile camper where she was bedridden diagnosed with colon cancer sometimes the only answer we re left with when the loved one s name is on the death list is to head for the exits and go home christopher got the hell out of texas his abandonment was reckless it prolonged his sentence y all can forget it he had numerous convictions and none were as strong as this unless you consider the other instance he went the distance similar situation it was a bizarre coincidence when he escaped from the prison the first time not this time but the one before he visited his dad cause he was dying inside of a mental ward suffering from alzheimer s he paid respects made his peace when he was done he didn t run he returned himself back to the police that s when his mom made her plea she said  he knows what he done was wrong but he knows his father don t got long he s not a fugitive on the run he s not dangerous he s our son he ain t never hurt no one he knows what he s done was wrong but he knows his father don t got long he s not a fugitive on the run he s our son this ain t no country western song christopher wasn t just running from cops christopher gay was now racing a clock his mother was dying and there was no time to be held inside of a cage with locks so y all can go on tossing rocks and talk your talk like tsk tsk meanwhile chris is stealing a tractor trailer from wal mart an 18 wheeler he s peeling rubber the bird takes flight down turnpikes three hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise but it ain t worth her life ran it off the road and abandoned it 50 yards from his moms to avoid the cops thats half a football field from her feeble arms after all this stuff the tour bus the pick up trucks the tractor trailer interstate chases he put on the brakes and couldn t get close enough the news reporters told people to lock their doors like there was a monster on the loose but there was no truth to those reports his mom had weeks to live and chris had years to serve they were within shouting distance but i don t think he heard her final words i don t think he heard her final words she made her plea to the tv he knows what he s done was wrong but he knows his mama don t got long he s not a fugitive on the run he s not dangerous he s my son he ain t never hurt no one he knows what he s done was wrong but he knows his mama don t got long he s not a fugitive on the run he s not dangerous he s my son this ain t no country western song the third time he escaped from a state cop at the georgia pit stop he just slipped out of the handcuffs he jumped ship then he took off with no father to visit no mom to go home to just a wide open sky where he could fly with no

fought cielo seven times and seven times he d left brave roosters dead hola my theresa i m thinkin of you now in san antonio i have twenty seven dollars and the good luck of your picture framed in

shining breast they were separated quickly they rose and fought each other thirty seven times again and the legends all agree that gallo del cielo he fought the best but now the cries of zaragoza fill the night outside the town of santa clara as the beak of del cielo lay broken like a shell within his hand and they say that zaragoza screamed a curse upon the bones of pancho villa as zorro rose up

clarity i was able to see my life as a fantasy i didnt have to live within a set reality being on shrooms was only a technicality my mind opened up and revealed all the love in me so much i want it to manifest it very publicly i begin to cry my friends came to comfort me all so lovingly they began hugging me and telling me that we were all family and that they had my back even when life challenged

when you live then you die where your body goes if it s hell or it s heaven 6 or the 7 well i ll keep the nina for all the foes with a gamble that s what life is and it s hard to handle when the bible

being are people just seeing things wondering if we get wings seems sick to believe in an extreme king i know it sounds far fetched every night i put knees on the carpet then i pray to who s up with the star set cause the earth in its self is a target for destruction for combustion cause there ain t too many you can trust in think of all the women losing their husbands in iraq a lot of killing and suffering what i hope for seemed folklore when the enemy kills and gloat more cause they killin us off in this hoax war then i wake up yellin and my throats sore cause the fight s there it s a nightmare if it come to me i m in my snipe wear if a bullet give my lung a slight tear i wanna believe that the light s there so all you christians don t get mad at me i just hope your mystical magical miracles work in catastrophes and this ain t blasphemy but artillery is my strategy i hope for a higher power when i look at all these tragedies if there is a final hour let s hope for a higher power 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 i have ammo what about you if there is a final hour let s hope for a higher power 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 i have ammo what about you i will never follow the beliefs of man why because man destroys everything in his path oh what a miracle angels and demons but the only miracle is that people keep believin right hand on the bible left hand on my rifle keep that for my rivals and evil disciples expand your mission man to women when they attack do you plan to give in or do you do like i do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition people like us piece and knife up cause we got evil to sweep and wipe up devils and demons and humans irrelevant so if they lookin deceiving i bust i hope that the higher power is watching over me cause we young people don t see faith like most the older see if he or she is listenin a mere sign can spark me but if the laws in the bible are bogus then prepare for anarchy worst case scenario is it never ever was a higher power so in the midst of chaos now the only real savior is fire power if there is a final hour let s hope for a higher power 1 by 1 and 2 by 2 i have ammo what about you if there is a final hour let s hope for a

angels above the trinity was in a perfect triangle of love chilled with no one else no need for others cause god is self sufficient fulfilled within himself and we can only guess the conversation but the son agreed to rescue those the father gave him and although this lord should be worshipped he volunteered to take upon the form of a servant the father commanded yet asked him to come so now let s examine the fashion it was done let me ask you if you seem confused with this god passed through his own creature s uterus i admit this is odd yet the bible can persuade me an omnipotent god crying as a baby no doctors around no spot could be found to give birth to a child the only option in town was to be born in a feeding trough with breeding cows and feces piles the scene was foul it wasn t fancy but raunchy how the son of god was born next to camels and donkeys what an awesome feat to drop so deep and cop his sheep he didn t step down he took a quantum leap and i m amazed how god infinite in wealth put aside his fame and limited himself to time and space and eyes and legs he died to save a violent race whose sin would bring em hell hook who d assume that this could be god became a man penetrating into human history but he did it completely opposite than people thought he would so unbelievers mocking it who d assume that this could be you became a man penetrating into human history but you did it completely opposite than i thought you would so i was mocking it verse 2 the promised messiah didn t come in the honor of sire but humbly rockin some modest attire so people missed it to be specific the legalistic thought their king would be the richest and we know we like commodities but the possessor of all riches chose a life of poverty wait it s not the descendant of david is this yes and he s descended the greatest distance he chilled with sinners and tax robbers amongst his creatures who to him were grasshoppers he dwelt with the lower class lowly men and those known as trash were his chosen kin and the unbelieving jews were sick of him they said he runs with a team of stupid fishermen and speaks to samaritans and barbarians pharisees stared at him with harsh arrogance it s shown when the savior took notice of beggars healed the blind and sick and those with lowest of wages he even touched those with leprosy which was seen as the most disgusting known infection see wait are you kidding me watch jesus go low and wash peter s toes what great humility see the second person of the trinity came down to rescue workers of iniquity check his earthly ministry he didn t make a bed he had no place to lay his head but he became bound to his own law but we found no flaw was from a rugged town so raw slumbered and slept hungered and wept and sweated plunged to our depth the sum of our debt s pathetic the humblest yet the humblest death that s dreaded the son is our rest come under him get his credit hook no question that he s g o d but he laid aside the full expression of his deity and surfed the chasm no words can fathom how god walked this earth which is cursed from adam no question that you re g o d but you laid aside the full expression of your deity and surfed the chasm no words can fathom how you walked this wicked earth verse 3 he was falsely condemned by jews and filthy pagans now the cross the peak of his humiliation no discussion sure they d best remove him he got the most disgusting form of execution he who sits upon the throne and rules was kicked and stomped and spit upon by roman fools despised by israel tried by sinful souls but was silent when struck by violent imbeciles and jesus was able to call down legions of angels but he was too faithful gracious and patient was him yet he was hated and forsaken by men like jews they hated his soul judas betrayed him for gold when it was tough his crew was afraid so they roll suckers they merked him this suffering servant was beat up and looked like he was cut by a surgeon slaughtered bleedin gushin oozin blood the father pleased to crush him whom he loved so he probably didn t even feel the crown and nails he had to suffer more than that to bring down the veil our eyes are haughty and our lies are naughty the holy christ bore our sins inside his body yea his veins they burst but no one s pain was worse cause the one who made the earth became a curse and he was one with the father s essence but on the cross the god of heavens cut off his presence so i can t share any language that can rightly describe the christ s despair and his

testaments the preview like its a prequel and of course westminster served this double albums particular purpose by teaching me tools like greek and hebrew and hermeneutics for in depth scriptural searches it enriched my family strengthened our worship but as i spent five years digging in verses the deeper i dug into the riches of christ the more i realized that im just skimming the surface it s organic unity starts like an acorn that through redemptive history grows as it takes form by the end its a full blooming oak tree revealing the glory of the crucified and raised lord the new testament writers assumed these assumptions the ot has christ centered truth in abundance its important you see this they use old testament language to paint inspired portraits of jesus cause ultimately the scriptures are one scroll that through progressive revelation it unfolds thus the old testament and of course the new is christs story and since were in him its our story too the new testament writers would ground what they wrote in old testament allusions with thousands of quotes and what ive found is so dope each of these themes are like strands that are tightly bound in a rope

it seems that it has more to offer than the lord who bought you but it s sure to drop you it s disappointing so we kill sin by the spirit every christian has this anointing only the spirit can filter this filthiness filling us with guilt instilled in ids killing kids so while america s at war in iraq we war with our flesh ready with our swords to attack so let s deal with our anger and doubt by getting to the root of it and yanking it out be militant and diligent when killing sin by the spirit let s kill sin don t provoke your flesh but choke to death the sin in your heart until there s no more breath be militant and diligent when killing sin by the spirit let s kill sin so you came forth at a meeting through the course of the evening to the altar call and prayed to the lord that you need him so now pick up your cross and follow the resurrected christ for all of the rest of your life can wicked fantasies understand man this ain t no handstamp christianity yet some folks seem to think they can continue in sin because their forgiven in him by no means yeah we re saved through faith in christ that s it but if we re saved then we ll hate unrighteousness we praise god for his super amazing grace but killing sin is the fruit of our saving faith it s no excuse that we re totally depraved because we re united to christ who rose up from the grave so being born from above is not freedom for us to bug just because jesus poured his blood the lamb he was slain to cancel our blame so listen kids he commands we abstain from wickedness christ was smashed when he took the wrath for us so to kill sin is the right reaction  we re not debtors to our flesh but to him who resurrected us when we were headed to our death be militant and diligent when killing sin by the spirit let s

wrists but now he s concerned by our own personal holiness yet we re proud and arrogant how dare us when he s given us himself for undefiled inheritance anger and jealousy that shouldn t be found in

pursuing purity and faith love and peace grace from our speech saints we hug and greet we re using courtesy satan s our rival and he s smart take up your bible and be sharp to amputate the idols in heart and be wise and surely hide his word inside so that when you re tempted you don t sin against him sow to the spirit don t sow to the flesh by listening to inappropriate but stay on your face in prayer and take your cares to the father and give him thanks and praise him there stay accountable and well equipped surround your soul with bountiful fellowship the only son is patient he gives grace when we re in need so we can overcome temptation every night our defense is the whole armor of god let s live a life of repentance running away from sin because there s infinitely more pleasure in christ so give all your praise to him he justified us so he ll sanctify us the kingdom of god is to be taken by violence be militant and diligent when killing sin by the spirit let s kill sin so let s

cause you seek finer things and seem fond of sin but please read 1 john 3 9 10 cause it s a warning dog it shows if you re a fraud and that this is impossible if you ve been born of god to live habitually sinful at least hear it from christ if you don t wanna listen to brindle please understand this jesus demands it those who really love him will keep his commandments killing sin is not a prescription of how to be forgiven it s a description of the christian who is forgiven by trusting in the risen christ who took our wrath and affliction killing sin is not a prescription of how to be forgiven but it s a description of the christian who is forgiven and the spirit now convicts them to put off and kill their sick sin i m a make this as basic as can be they say a saved saint is like a tree since their faith is in christ their root s in the soil so they re saved for life and their fruit isn t spoil so it makes since that if the root is alive the dead branches fall off but their fruits gonna thrive but if there s no evidence of a changed life sin s a claimed price so you re still dead in sin so jesus is lord your lips confess but killing sin is that confession s litmus test if perhaps the truth is that you re lacking proof with absent fruit the axe is at the root so let s be specific you say but god knows my heart yeah he knows that it s desperately wicked so you can repent and accept the truth dude or else when you meet christ hear i never knew you so let s start from the top your heart is a rock you must trust christ s death for your charges to drop no repent pretenders and present your members to him who does contenders like fender benders i ain t saying that i m flawless from sin i m saying when i fall i go to the cross and repent and just cause we believe in eternal security don t mean we re not concerned with personal purity cause those who ve been elected chosen and predestined won t rest till the day our souls have been perfected so we ll

so kid repent of evil wickedness but in a sense when a christian sins its more sickening than sins of wicked men cause weve tasted his goodness as recipients of grace so every time we inn its like were spitting his face if christians are no longer trapped in its bondage then why as dogs do we go back to our vomit how dare us believers not cherish this jesus and instead indulge in sin its scary to see this until we make christ our treasured king and see his worth above everything we wont recognize sins evil nature or appreciate our bleeding grieving savior my point is this sin is so wicked but we dismissed this cause were so distant from the lords glorious light its not til were in it that well see sins horrible sight but perhaps the greatest mystery is that the holy one himself became

judgment on anything unclean that would defile his holy temple adam was a priest judge adam was a priest judge adam was a priest judge he was put in eden to keep it from anything unclean cause it was a temple god with his people so adam s job was to guard it from evil genesis 2 turn to the part verse 15 and observe this remark for keep the hebrew verb is shamar and in its context yo the word means to guard and this is seen in chapter 3 24 where adam s no longer priest anymore cause of his arrogance ensnared in sin now shamar s used for the guards the cherubim cause of what happened back a few verses an intruder in the garden that was the serpent was it an accident no it happened on purpose for adam to image god and smash him for certain and since adam fell yahweh chose a new priestly race in genesis chapter 12 though abraham s from a pagan fam the great i am called him to canaan and it s a new eden new creation land flowing with milk and honey where his holy place would stand in the midst of this nation clan for them to be priest to every race of man seen in abraham s desperate plea full of intercession to rescue please his nephew lot before he s wrecked to cease but they re not just ancients of blessed peace israel is his collective priest to judge those who sin incessantly genesis 15 the text it reads the sin of the amorites is not yet complete in other words this double purpose to rescue his precious kids in exodus was to show abundant mercies plus for his judging servants to bring justice curses on canaanites for disgusting worship and they must deserve it cause they re really the offspring of that ugly serpent be convinced as i teach exodus 19 israel s a kingdom of priests true indeed but do you see the levites are priest judges within the community yahweh s holy wrath is intense beholding the golden calf incident so moses boldly asks of his men who love the lord it don t matter the sin the levites as a whole gather to him to hear the holy task that he gives take your sword from your thigh cause the lord was despised killed 3 000 who abhorred adonai a strange form of praise and worship maybe these verses make you nervous but exodus 32 29 that day was the levites ordination service jump with me to numbers 3 the levites were to kill anyone unclean their priestly charge was to keep and guard the tabernacle several times we see shamar leviticus since yahweh is in the midst purge sin and get rid of this but the illest is phineas who saw the insidious worship of baal hideous he went in the tent where an israelite laid with the woman from midian then he stabbed them in their abdomen with a javelin so god s wrath was spent he was a priest judge  the promised land was blessed and precious the place of yahweh s special temple presence so the wicked yes best be put to death intruders in the land they should be dispossessed driven out given now into the hand of joshua who quickly rout stricken and hit no doubt then slain by the edge of the sword with a shout listen pal priest judgment was what the canaanite conquest is about foreshadowed by abram who slaughtered kings devoted to destruction his offerings but this is rowdy right when saul failed to kill agag the amalekite samuel shows what an actual priest is with his sword he hacks agag to pieces crushing the head of goliath with a rock cause that serpent defied the living god in david s killing spree of philistines a priest judge king is really seen so it s not limited to a specific office elijah smitten all the wicked it s the prophets after god s fire consumed the entire offering elijah slaughtered them all these priest judges were incomplete but there s a final prophet judge kingly priest yeah i m talking about jesus the lord the one who came not to bring peace but a sword the first adam should ve did what s essential so the second adam was cleansing the temple of the wicked and unlawful then washing the feet of his twelve new israel apostles cause he s the lamb and the priest and the temple judged in our place for our deeds that are sinful so the living god has raised him to destroy that false temple that synagogue of satan 70 ad now his holy discipline does steadily spank me his true temple he s changing his nation tearing down our idols and sanctification his grace is aflaming cleansing his peeps his church is his end time kingdom of priests so in church discipline now the elders are priest judges to purge sinful men though josh in the land routs heathens the greater joshua was casting out demons when he returns he ll physically spiritually cleanse the land of all who displease him in the greek text follow matthew 12 to cast out demons we see ekballo revelation 12 says in its pages he casts out satan from the heavenly places along with his henchmen already at the cross and resurrection accomplished at ascension but at the second coming you ll the perfect picture of the priest judge executing judgment revelation 19 demonstrates what i mean see his robes he s arrayed as high priest watch the son of god unleash millions of saints and angels his squad is deep bronze his feet when in his sovereign seat he returns to squash the beef christ the cosmic priest when at the perfect season will come to do his earthly cleaning it will be purged of heathens thrown into the eternal furnace heated with the fury of the wrath of the almighty then we ll worship god rightly since the son s faithful we ll fulfill our second adam s status as we judge angels since the son s faithful we ll fulfill our second adam s status as we judge angels christian you a priest judge because he was now we crush deeds of greed lust so that jesus deep love is seen much he was double priest judge so clean up clean up he kills sin","artist_name":"Timothy

scripts or spiritual rappers who cap demons are only spittin mythical its garbage ive been sittin on it for too long christian rappers puttin all this demonic rap in their songs its embarassin what a

youre distracted playin his advocate drawin attention to him instead of god the matchless so catch this try to let god do the rebukin like michael remember the truths that jude mentioned and i aint even tryin to diss but don be surprised if you swing your bible and nobody gets hit yo and if you aint rappin the truth but your laughin at demons the ones around are probly laughin at you so preach the gospel and stop tryin to prove that youre gods ghostbuster and the bible is a glock that you shoot for the sake of clarity i felt it necessary to bring attention to the differing subjects and audiences of the two parts of this song which by this break i have now made an obvious distinction though both are intended to provoke a berean mentality the aforementioned is directed to those who fall under the teacher category and are therefore worthy of a greater condemnation the following is written to christendom in general concerning a common mistake of lesser importance therefore you may feel free to disagree however i do urge you to study the scriptures for yourself before assuming my stupidity now as i was saying one more thing i gotta get off my chest before i get off of the topic of this spiritual mess yo the word the bible translates as angel means a messenger not a winged baby with a halo the word angel is used in reference to apostles jesus himself and other disciples too and when the angel isnt from earth they usually think that hes just a man when his message is served theyre never female always fully grown never children never seen with the wings but usually in some white linen the halos are probly the dumbest part the only logical explanation for their origin is catholic art totally mythical never known to be scriptural however its still accepted in the church of the biblical just another fourteen im almost done let me tell you bout the cherubim and where the wings come from the cherubim got wings its not strange though they never deliver messages so theyre not angels the seraphim got six and in isaiah one speaks to him the only time theyre seen in the scripts so to me its totally obvious in heaven the cherubim are the priests and the angels are the prophets the seraphim may be that rare breed that can be both like jesus jeremiah and ezekiel but demons and angels aint the point of the song if it was itd be silly for it to be this long i thought somebody had to say something if not the populous would continue to walk in silly assumptions so i wrote this in the hopes of provokin kids to study the scripts before the word is

play along he sees the notes as they fly by but always plays them wrong and in the bathroom it gets blurry gets warm and distorted like light pushed the orange of the pillbox he poured in his palm it falls to the floor he smiles as it hits sounds a little like an instrument like a voice in the choir that hum and that drumbeat of life as an art form and fire through the streets that keep moving us in silence to phantom baton sweeps keep tapping to the tempo of our feet and all the ones who seem to fit the best into the chorus never notice theres a song and the ones who seem to hear it end up tortured by the chords when they fail to find a way to sing along and when you sing the wrong thing it all starts collapsing starts to ring out and feedback starts lapsing and crashing on notes that dont clash but that never quite feel like they match and i never quite feel like mine match theres a melody in everything im trying to find a harmony but nothing seems to work nothing seems to fit

everything from friends and family and my own ambitions from having fun i just shut off from everything self defeating yeah probably but i dont know that i had total control over it and im not sure it even matters why sometimes things happen and you cant do anything plus im the only one who deals with it anyway so if everyone could do me a favor and just put their fingers down id and keep your

in the passenger seat its a mystery the ways you can sleep i want to leave here for where nobody goes i want to breathe in the air of all those sprawling ancient spaces on earth you said were so scared of alone and i knew what you meant you want to go where it glows all those places where your watch doesnt work you were riding those nights on the highway always hiding out inside a songwriters dream there like a scene from a song born to run or maybe running on empty ones where they would leave certain nights when youd fight you couldnt stick around so youd head out of town just hit the highway and drive certain nights when youd thought it was fine but it shook you when the baby would cry why did you always turn around in the end to hear the shattering of glass on the door again so loud the baby couldnt sleep anymore what didnt you find that you were looking for your mother called a hardware set you up an interview an answer to an ad the bosses daughter still remembers dinner where her father said he wouldnt stick his neck out for trouble again but they did then and those days youd wake up and just decide you wouldnt show hed show up at your door nights youd skip town hed follow you out pretty soon you started falling for their daughter and she fell for you drive roll every window down let the desert enter heavy and primitive in drift till rumble strips sound time moves so slow but i know that you meant what you said you want to go where its frozen all those places where the highways dont reach  you want to go where it glows somewhere that time is irrelevant you want to go where it glows somewhere the spaces are infinite you want to go where it glows somewhere you dont feel the hours pass by you identified the flowers on the road i rolled the windows down and shut off the radio did you ever think youd end up here all those late nights you were driving alone you were riding to hide or you were looking for a brand new life did you ever think youd find one back home did you even think youd get out alive could you imagine then the love you now know i think historys a system of roads and theres nowhere it doesnt go i pulled over to the side and felt

metal twisting and everything tumbling at the end of the work day stuck in traffic dont feel when the road sways underneath concrete gives metal twisting and everything tumbling to their partners and

through the metal twisting upward like a sculpture or some terrible beast people trapped in their cars put both feet on the glass and then kick hard water pours in seatbelts twist river flowing and everything going down people under the water line workers sift through the wreckage of it find seatbelts stuck water fills up river flowing and everything going downstream on the dining room wall i watched it play in the reflection of the television the reversal in the mirror hung i could see it all how the dust clouds gather color as they billow out shades change shifting in the night from the lights atop an ambulance like a fireworks flash then that otherworldly glow in the smoke thrown in the aftermath blows almost frozen for a moment there i could see it all every dust cloud shattered glass billow out on the tv wires snap and the concrete gives metal twists up and onward i can see it all every dust cloud shattered glass billow out on the tv wires snap and the concrete gives in metal twists up and onward i watch and i can see it all all the wreckage all the cars piled in the river and the rail yard metal twists wires snap concrete blocks split dangle from tie rods and metal twists up wires sway when a breeze blows in the distant sirens glow i can see it all where they look for survivors searchlights float change the color of smoke clouds and shadows still fall people under the water people trapped in their cars kick and try to get out people still with their seat belts on pets they had in the back and car seats and i watch it on tv lying down here on the floor in the dining room reversed in the mirror where i know im not dreaming now but i know ive been sleeping i just dont know since when i only know that its light outside i only know that the rent is still late when did they find out the concrete gave when did they learn that the wires snapped 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there were shadows in the bedroom where the light got thrown by the lamp on the nightstand on your mothers side after midnight still you can see it all you can see it all and the closet in the corner on the far back shelf with the keepsakes she hid that box there full of letters of regret by the pictures of the kids you get faint recollections of your mothers sigh countryside drive and the landscape seen from the window of the backseat with some flowers in a basket that afternoon after school you and your older sisters found your parents in the kitchen at the table father lifting off the lid of the box and a hush fell over everything like a funeral prayer a reverence ancestral heavy in the air though you didnt understand what it meant that they never said her name aloud around you even sitting at the table with her things theyd kept you recall faintly cards tiny clothes and the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom until then you didnt know thats what the box had held your parents tiptoeing slowly around always speaking in code no they never said her name aloud around you only told you it was perfect where your sister went and you didnt understand why it hurt them so much then that shed come and left so soon could only guess inside your head at what a stillbirth meant only knew that mother wept you watched while father held her said some things come but cant stay here you saw a brightness like a light through your eyes closed tight then she tumbled away from here some place to remain in the nighttime shadows she made to be an absence in mom a sadness hanging over her like some pentecostal flame drifting on and off she was sister only whispered sometimes her or the child we lost you were visions a vagueness a faded image you were visions you were a flame lit that burned out twice as brightly as the rest of us did when you left you were light then you tumbled away there are shadows that fall still here at a certain angle in the bedroom on the nightstand by your mothers side from the light left on there theres the box in the closet all the things kept and the landscape where she left flowers on the grave marble where they etched that name and mother cried the whole way home but she never said it once out loud on the way back home from where you thought they meant when they said where sister went after grandpa got hospice sick and he couldnt fall asleep they wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night and i saw the light on the day that he died by their bed in grandmas eyes while us grandkids said our goodbyes she said dont cry somewhere he holds her said a name i didnt recognize and the light with all the shadows combined2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"funny what you think of after a collapse while lying in the dirt the first thing that comes back is never quite what youd have guessed and if you could

her bidding i remember once their dad came in said you think this is bad you dont know the half and he laughed its funny what things come back the first things you see how he sort of smiled like its only a joke but he was lying there was something else inside of his eyes all those secrets people tell to little children are warnings that they give them like look im unhappy please dont make the

can hear the voice coming over the radio listen to our experts give the best tips for the next time you entertain dinner guests i thought of the day in a tie in the kitchen i sat and i watched you put

saw my grandpa at his workbench building grandmas bookshelf watched a woman walk her trash out to the street father alone on the highway i heard the salt trucks and neighbors off to work saw my mother saw how history loops around all of these moments and then i saw you in a dress there with your eyes open wide to put make up on thought of the day in the basement that i played house and i felt

laid everything out on the carpet books kitchen things objects with specific purpose or none arranged them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoored out of context and then considered it first the whole picture then everything individually humming along at the deadest pace imaginable one object then another and then the next and i wondered what they meant there if they meant anything still found notes camping supplies a book you bought in the desert identifying wildflowers pictures from vacations from parties kitschy gifts we bought from rest stops on that road trip out west objects everything itself and then memory all of it laid out there from the dining room the living room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we called the office but never used even the

carefully without reason or at least without one i understood or could describe there on the table together and when i was done and stepped back i realized what i had made keepsakes pictures letters ordinary objects all collected there a memorial and i thought of ones on highways or set by gravestones all the things you see there but dont understand but still bring a remembered thing back vividly invoke someones reality when there together in that place in that way out of context and i knew i had to take it down before anybody else saw tomorrow i plan to put them all somewhere those things in boxes side of the road attic maybe all these things that push and pull me through history to places i once was places i mightve gone places i ended up going postcards ticket stubs from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug neither your name nor mine phone cards and old phones a page from an old calendar i bought once at a thrift store and insisted on hanging that cycles of the moon print photos old boots of mine put them in boxes and i sat there for hours in the living room first then in the dining room moving things around picking things up and seeing where they took me to what

back on the bike to play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows then switch to playing ding dong ditch when that gets old and too cold to hack it threw on a bomber jacket you could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing gazelles and if they really had money raised be sporting bk s and all the girls had they turkish link if it broke then they made earrings to it like they meant

my good luck and spend it on a padlock the bad thoughts and the whiskey are better company than bullshit so just leave it and go i don t want to go outside today no i want to be left alone i don t want to put the mask on my face no i want to be left alone i don t want to get up out my bed i want to be left alone didn t hear a goddamn word you said go home i hit the still water coasting on hope

to space you re either leaving me alone or all up in my face and lately with the way that things are going i don t taste the sugar in your words for me to give a shit about what you say yup i m crazy and irrational always tell the truth so that you can call me asshole i prefer the black hole over the sun plant a seed up in the sound garden watered with rum it s not the same when you re looking through the frame of a broken heart the smoke blinds but also helps you look the part so you can knock it til your knuckles get scars i suggest you leave it and go i don t want to go outside today no i want to be left alone i don t want to put the mask on my face no i want to be left alone i don t want to get up out my bed i want to be left alone didn t hear a goddamn word you said go
