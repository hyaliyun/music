hot now you re calling the shots now switch things up you gotta shake that label call it what you want call it what you gotta it s a struggle in the booth to make the truth sound hotter make you feel proper make you feel just right and it s some insecurities just to help you sleep at night so fall back if you don t feel me i don t even feel me sometimes i think that i do this shit to try and heal me maybe be appealing maybe grow a fan base but honestly i only make this music for my own sake you want my own take here s my two cents i don t need your recognition just a record with depth an intense one that just lets me just vent one that knows when i m happy or i wanna get bent and guess what homeboy that s all i ever need introspection over beats and a party for the fiend a cd full of a songs and a mic for me to speak into if music speaks to you please take heed think about it write it down find someone who you can teach it to i m not preachin dude i m just trying to cleanse a lyrical colonic shake the demons in my head sometimes you ve gotta purge yourself to make it out of bed the hands go up but they always come down that s the sad truth when you re living for the crowd

put headphones on and drink till you pass out praying for a drought help you shake your dark cloud  inspiration don t come cheap these days so i go the opposite direction tryin to keep this faith no religion but hip hop has given me the opportunity to put a hundred percent into something that is true to me and usually my muses show up so i start sippin allow me to gas myself so i stop trippin and overthinking and analyzing everything i do so i can find out what life looks easier for you how the hell did i develop all of this social anxiety and fuck a zoloft i roll off and get high with these bottles and beers trying to forget those years i don t need a script doctor but let s just say cheers and tip that say sip sip sippin on the jazzers and when your people join you then you know it s going to be magic but when you re on a vision quest they say that it s a hazard but trust me i would never let it turn to something tragic there s been to many kids lost in my home town must be something in the water shed cuz i know now suicidal teens ain t born they re bred so give them something to hope for instead of pullin the thread unravellin all of their dreams at the seams i believe in doing for self but it s nice having a team that s why i self medicate just to help meditate introspection is arrestin when you can t catch a break the hands go up but they always come down that s the sad truth when you re living for the crowd the show s been over but you still wanna bow you really should hang it up but you re just too proud the beat s too low and the vocal s too loud even in

sing apologies and stare as my mom would hang the clothes across the line and she would try to keep the empty from her eyes so then one afternoon i dressed myself alone i packed my pillowcase with everything i owned and in my head i said goodbye then i was gone and i set out on the heels of the unknown so my folks could have a new life of their own and that maybe i could find someone who could

and jot it down cause it s the truth to me you should see it s all that ever helped held my shattered world together when i knocked it off the shelf into the blackness tripping over broken hearts and homes and getting close enough to turn that kid inside of me to stone and i ll admit it cause i was never taught to give it up sailed an ocean full of drug addicted misincouraged blood without a paddle it took a lot of faith to fight my battles and tackle a couple of habits i never thought that i d have to but did bottle the water under the bridge and toss another written page of my history to the wind when it blows cause all of this disaster has lead me home and left a lot of room for me to learn to grow yeah you are not alone grab hold of yourself i know what it s like to get blown away i know you that you ve done your dirt and you ve dug your graves and it feels like it won t be saved i say grab hold yourself and face those days when you feel like it always rains i ve seen the sunny side of hell that which i never thought i d find for myself never thought i d find for myself  not your same old song i ve been writing on a mirror with a razor blade and chased away the devil in my brain that played me like a spade cause day to day painted jaded faith issues a shade of gray and cowered hid behind emotion just to play it safe a pawn slowly turning victim to my wrongs i had to wake up all alone to finally figure out my wants in the house of haunted love the past will keep me warned and explain me even if you re listening through the storm i found a purpose and if you heard this then sit it down pick its brain until it opens up and redirects the sound the conductor frozen thunder rumbling through the ground with a perfect little twist of that suited armor and crown you created built for denying it hiding the cuts and bruises due to the self inflicted bone crushing anxiety i m with you so understand that all of this within you has chiseled you a flower out of stone yeah you are not alone grab hold of yourself i know what it s like to get blown away i know you that you ve done your dirt and you ve dug your graves and it feels like it won t be saved i say

morning and when it s time to return to the gloom you know we shared a little moment yeah yeah oh we shared a little moment","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i don t have no ring but i could steal one on

streets tonight there s a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight through the concrete canyons to the midtown lights where the latest neon promises are burning bright past the open windows on the darker streets where unseen angry voices flash and children cry past the phony posers with their worn out lines the tired new money dressed to the nines the lowlife dealers with their bad designs and the dilettantes with their open minds you re out on the town safe in the crowd ready to go for the ride searching the eyes looking for clues there s no way you can hide the fire inside well you ve been to the clubs and the discotheques where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious and the lights go down and they dance real close and for one brief instant they pretend they re safe and warm then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone the darkness scatters as the lights flash on they hold one another just a little too long and they move apart and then move on on to the street on to the next safe in the knowledge that they tried faking the smile hiding the pain never satisfied the fire inside fire inside  now the hour is late and he thinks you re asleep you listen to him dress and you listen to him leave like you knew he would you hear his car pull away in the street then you move to the door and you lock it when he s gone for good then you walk to the window and stare at the moon riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky and it comes to you how it all slips away youth and beauty are gone one day no matter what you dream or feel or say it ends in dust and disarray like wind on the plains sand through the glass waves rolling in with the tide dreams die hard and we watch them erode but we cannot be denied the fire inside fire inside ooh the fire inside burning you up burning you up fire inside","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"step back step

you leave us in the dark we saw your old flames and some were burning yet it made us smile to see just how well tended each was kept but other fires were burning too and i saw the battlefields the dying light brigade stretched out upon the wheel  every heart is much the same we tell ourselves down here the same chambers fed by veins the same maze of love and fear we thought you were a saint but
