from minds of the blind the church unfurled for murder perched upon the death of love framed amid the thick of fire aflame a valkyrie she claimed the skies were lit with spires and in his eyes she

me a chauffeur keep my enemies close keep my friends even closer muhfuckers that i grew around thought i could rock wit em watch my cake so hard they burn a hole in my pocket i see em coming from afar because i been through so much shit they plot a lot hard or not they see my dough come quick invested in my niggas took the realtor route gambled on the wrong niggas had to filter em out type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full it s cool though i fucks wit em even though i ain t wit it that s why the gats be in the house whenever niggas come visit serve em drinks and welcome all to the law for let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off i seen it one too many times your peeps be leaving you speechless sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness see now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me they see my name and lifestyle and say i changed they so cold i know that they re out to get me and all those people i call my friends let it go that s why i never call on y all to be around cause you see how this money can change everything listen sometimes i smoke a cigarette and then i think and i choke on how niggas steal this funny style and i was struggling broke even though it don t surprise me shit it s still kinda funny when i ain t have a nigga still would come and try to take from me instead of cutting my losses being smart and just end shit niggas was trying to be loyal just to maintain a friendship in the wrong situation plus there s always a sequel i m with the wrong muhfuckers plus they pose to be people s as i get more money days get colder i learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder so then i start the heart on my heart as i walk like a soldier moving so militant you think i had a chip on my shoulder living by morals and principles mainly having heavy thoughts to a kill my brother every time them fuckers betray me but now i m winning with the strength of the nation i promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they ll be facing i m aftermath now shit s getting worse now when those same friends see me goin hard that shit be making em hurt  they see my name and lifestyle and say i changed they so cold i know that they re out to get me and all those people i call my friends let it go that s why i never call on y all to be around cause you see how this money can change everything instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich when i m outta town these niggas busy tryna fuck with my bitch same niggas spend they money til the shit ll diminish i hit em off and turn around and come right back when it finish i said i m tired of these niggas that ll owe me so much shit that they can t pay me back for fuck all the dumb shit sometime we can t forgive whatever balances off specially when niggas cross the line that niggas never should cross realized and thus i state the same shit get the range the more money niggas get shit around you will change even though niggas ll flip and say you the one changed fuck you they do that just to justify takin your shit from you the more money i get i get more dangerous stupid cause i been broke before and i refuse to go back to it and while i sweep these niggas up under the rug with a broom if i never see these friends again that shit ll be too soon shit is real like every wind in my breath and that s on everything i love blood of my blood flesh of my flesh they see my name and lifestyle and say i changed they so cold i know that they re out to get me and all those people i call my friends let it go that s why i never call on y all to be around cause you see how this money can change everything1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"ayo swizz this shit sound like some shit the streets wanna do the merengue to or dance around a
