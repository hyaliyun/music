with hippies and more doobies so i don t really need the one that is in the pocket of my shirt in my suitcase and i wonder if they ll find it and i wonder what they ll do depending on their mood they could put it in their pocket of their tsa shirt or maybe they re disgruntled and just spark it where they stand or maybe they will give it to their friend steve the cop who will put it in his pocket and give it to the rasta who works at the starbucks at gate 39 in hoping of continuing of receiving his free triple tall americana shots on top that he desperately needs that extra caffeine so that he can walk his miles and miles of luggage with his female german shepherd that he named eva braun for the david lindley song or at least that song that lindley does i m not really sure if david lindley

remember me happily by the rosebush laughing with bruises on my chin the time when we counted every black car passing your house beneath the hill and up until someone caught us in the kitchen with maps a mountain range a piggy bank a vision too removed to mention but please remember me fondly i heard from someone you re still pretty and then they went on to say that the pearly gates had some eloquent graffiti like we ll meet again and fuck the man and tell my mother not to worry and angels with their great handshakes but always done in such a hurry and please remember me at halloween making fools of all the neighbors our faces painted white by midnight we d forgotten one another and when the morning came i was ashamed only now it seems so silly that season left the world and then returned and now you re lit up by the city so please remember me mistakenly in the window of the tallest tower call then pass us by but much too high to see the empty road at happy hour gleam and resonate just like the gates around the holy kingdom with words like lost and found and don t look down and someone save temptation and please remember me as in the dream we had as rug burned babies among the fallen trees and fast asleep beside the lions and the ladies that called you what you like and even might give a gift for your behavior a fleeting chance to see a trapeze swinger high as any savior but please remember me my misery and how it lost me all i wanted those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains the colored birds above there running in circles round the well and where it spells on the wall behind st peter so bright on cinder gray in spray paint who the hell can see forever and please remember me seldomly in the car behind the carnival my hand between your knees you turn from me and said the trapeze act was wonderful but never meant to last the clowns that passed saw me just come up with anger when it filled with circus dogs the parking lot had an element of danger so please remember me finally and all my uphill clawing my dear but if i make the pearly gates i ll do my best to make a drawing of god and lucifer a boy and girl an angel kissin on a sinner a monkey and a man a marching band all around the frightened trapeze swinger nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"give it up for me please put your hands in the air if you

the moment got a hopeless feel but the feeling in itself got its own appeal i m attracted to the lights in the distance the closer that i get and the brighter my wish gets excited by the risk and the chances i m taking not sure what i m putting my faith in but i ma be alright i m trying to get mine in this lifetime the afterlife is much further in the pipeline i m inclined to believe that but the truth is that for death any moment is the right time so i live every day like it s my last but i plan for tomorrow as if i will never pass a pharaoh on the subway who never dreamed of jets but fell asleep on the runways i just know that one day that anything i needed i could mold get everything you want it ain t always good for your soul a mix of self worth some help little control and i don t know the rest good as mine is your guess the recipe ain t the best to make it though is our quest and if you choose to accept the meaning of life is yes cause only god knows those of us in the flesh get the privilege to test and some will fail and some will pass we all get the same grade though when we run the path how you grade yourself is the mark that matters most to separate the heart of the strong and the battered folks have a dose  ayo this so real not knowing what s ahead but i ma go there still living in the moment got a hopeless feel but the feeling in itself got its own appeal i know i m attracted to the lights in the distance the closer that i get and the brighter my wish gets excited by the risk and the chances i m taking not sure what i m putting my faith in but i ma be alright ayo shit so real kill shit to live nigga schizo feel i got a hunger for knowledge and i miss no meals i stay high off life and i miss no pills i m addicted to the thrill of walking along the edge not knowing what lies ahead but always knowing the deal i m good with my decisions the setbacks and gains is all a part of the game i m ready to spin the wheel whatever is in store i m ready for it for sure with the attitude of wealth and the gratitude of the poor the balance is the challenge and i sit so still between callus and analysis but this no frills i m off the chain been that way since slaves to flav from 93 til infinity i m slated in ways that s etched in stone the age where we market ourselves we still all about the music i don t monitor plays i don t monitor hits and i don t monitor clicks i monitor the snare drum and the bottom of kicks is anybody left that still fuck with this true shit well let me hear you scream over top of this cru shit ayo this so real not knowing what s ahead but i ma go there still living in the moment got a hopeless feel but the feeling in itself got its own appeal i know i m attracted to the lights in the distance the closer that i get and the brighter my wish gets excited by the risk and the chances i m taking not sure what i m putting my faith in but i ma be alright34","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"yeah time to put it down e time to

breath say you love me we both know that everything changes keep in mind that none of this is fiction this is just a glimpse into the head of a menace we were two different children but we born of the same moon blowing entire opposite we were brought up the same too i used to hate you because they celebrate you and you made them notice every single thing i cant do but really i honestly wanted to be you and i just hope my desire to wasnt that see through i never took into account the things that you were hiding i even understood your rage when i see you get violent i guess the height of all my envy was leaving me blinded until you sat me down and told me how crazy your life is you said to run and never look back and if i did to never lose track of all the hurdles i was jumping that lead me to my current goal dont sell your soul baby you are dirty gold took a chance said youd love me we both know that everything changes you found me when i was dying and unappreciated you broke me down into a science that i completely hated you told impeccable talent didnt make me less average but how i use it to my advantage determined my passion it took some time to understand and manage but then i learned this passion was the method to my madness and i never got to thank you at least not in the way i planned but i had to learn before i did that i hope you understand it takes a lot for me to bury hatchets but consider them cremated all the ashes burned to ashes and im dusting off my vocal box and finally saying thank you and even though you aint my fan you did the shit they aint do so disregard my temper and the times i fucking hate you because despite all my ignorance im really fucking grateful never forget the importance of the spot you hold  took a glance towards the mirror now i know that everything changes i used to hate me i swore my life was too painful let my demons overtake me before i fight with my angels there was constantly a struggle to see my life at an angle that provided understanding of how much drama could change you i used to cut myself open just to feel like i was living but when living is just dying then theres no longer a difference theres no longer existence and theres no longer persistence and theres no longer a drive there existing on only division and i thought if nobody ever loved me this vacancy inside me must be really called a bloodstream then i looked into the world and saw a million people like me probably never know your stories but youre the reason im fighting youre the reason im writing music could be so reviving and if ever you tend to forget im right here to remind you dont ever give into the hurt you hold dont sell your soul baby you are dirty gold 12","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"worldwide you re officially tuned in to a

broke down we were headed on down to new where we did not see the gas low the gas low the gas below got so low so low i lost my soul somewhere on the road but im a get it back real soon mike wont you get it back youve been chasing footsteps for year and running around in circles for years chasing my tail looking for answers to questions ive never heard its a wide open world im trying to find it its a wide open sky but its light and blinding and its raining down on me slowing me down but i keep on going i know i recognize this man walking in front of me when he turned around and locked eyes with me and it scared me to see myself in twenty years lost ashamed locked up loaded down driving on i could change my ways and i took a different road no more running around in circles no more chasing my tail im just going forward these days with my eyes closed i know i can make it f ck it i know i can make it if i try i must let love live inside me for a while and maybe later on ill see

rehearsed inside he was teeming with contempt for these men who were turning the story from the real headline the unveiling of his newest marvel a giant telescreen just above their heads mounted to the top of the building would within minutes broadcast information non stop to every citizen of the city no matter soon these men and their questions would be obsolete he reluctantly turned his own statements to the media frenzy at hand tonight the streets are red the lights are blue and blinding no sign of the good doctor but the siren s wail and whining tell us he ll be found he made his way to the window overlooking the city i can almost hear the hounds he turned back to the reporters what kind of man builds a machine to kill a girl no he did not use his hands like a smart man he used a tool but just the same how can you question who s to blame what was her name doesn t matter now listen the good doctor has to pay stepping away from the throng of reporters he looked at the digital countdown above the nerve center of his broadcasting controls he whispered quietly to himself when i say he was a monster when i set fire to his name it does not matter where you hear it from whether truth or lies it gets said all the same  glancing once again at the countdown he spoke plainly to the reporters whatever s on the table plays 1 minute 46 seconds until the broadcast would begin wily shut the door on the tumult of voices continuing to shout questions after him he walked down the empty hallway and around a corner and into the studio adjacent to his control room a pane of double plated glass sealed out the bedlam of the reporters he watched as their mouths continued to hurl impotent questions in the silence of the studio he didn t bother trying to make out what they were saying his eyes focused on a blinking red light above the digital countdown he spoke aloud his words bounced off the soundproofing glass the cameras weren t yet rolling the microphones were not yet active his words went unheeded for the last time there is a flame that i ve been fanning there is a fire waiting to catch there is a hell that has been building from the moment we first met 58 seconds to air if there ever was a time if there ever was a chance to undo the things i ve done and wash these bloodstains from my hands 49 seconds to air it has passed and been forgotten these are the paths that we must take cause you and i tom we are men and we can bend and we can break 40 seconds to air if you think that you can run if you think that you can stand well you forget who turned this city on you forget who plugged this city in 30 seconds to air they ll not switch it off again he straightened his tie knocked the wrinkles out of his suit jacket and faced the camera lens one by one they re tuning in 15 seconds to air at this very moment his moment of glory he wished he could be out in the streets of the city he wished he could hear the hum of a thousand tubes powering the screen popping to life and warming up simultaneously wished he could feel the wave of sound as they drew the attention of every person within the walls of the city his city he wished he could float above the streets as every person walked from their homes left their dinners their polite conversations their lives wished he could be there as they filed out into the streets fixed their eyes on the giant screen and waited 3 seconds but albert s place was here his time was now he cleared his throat the red blinking light went solid outside on the giant screen wily s face came into focus for the first time the people of the city looked to one man they saw the face of a leader one man towering above the city after a few inspirational opening lines wily turned his attention to the matter at hand thomas light he assured them that the murderer would be apprehended he promised them that their city would be made safe again they trusted him completely2","artist_name":"The Protomen"},{"lyrics":"i

you in her sheets still warm with him now filled with filth and foul disease as time wore on you proved a debt ridden drunken mess leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch oh ohhhhh and then you disappeared your gambling arrears the only thing you left behind and then the magistrate reclaimed our small estate and my poor mother lost her mind then one day in spring my dear sweet mother died but before she did i took her hand as she dying cried oh ohhhhh find him bind him tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters drag him to a hole until he wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave death rattle it took me fifteen years to swallow all my tears among the urchins in the street until a priory took pity and hired me to keep their vestry nice and neat but never once in the employ of these holy men did i ever once turn my mind from the thought of revenge oh ohhhhh  one night i overheard the prior exchanging words with a penitent whaler from the sea the captain of his ship who matched you toe to tip was known for wanton cruelty the following day i shipped to sea with a privateer and in the whistle of the wind i could almost hear oh ohhhhh find him bind him tie him to a pole and break his fingers to splinters drag him to a hole until he wakes up naked clawing at the ceiling of his grave there is one thing i must say to you as you sail across the sea always your mother will watch over you as you avenge this wicked deed and then that fateful night we had you in our sight after twenty months at sea your starboard flank abeam i was getting my muskets clean when came this rumbling from beneath the ocean shook the sky went black and the captain quailed as before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale oh oh oh don t know how i survived the crew all was chewed

fine with that in the event i decide to move forward what you ve done they can rewind it back and i m a proud parent now as i was a proud parent then i saw you grow up to become the kind of king that i knew you d always been indeed there s a finish line for me but for you there s no end so perhaps all that work that has been done was a win and although my intentions were for good it still brung us to a sin but i ll pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin and as this vessel of mine breaks down i know you have never bend i m sure as multi is your home hard times will come again i set aside a book of rhymes that ll pave the way for now and then i know forever is a mighty long timeso where should we begin on the southside cause i m a country bumpkin bumpin out the system fuck if they don t listen we done came a long way from niggas throwing cds out the window like i made a frisbee better than veteran rapper s favorite rappers conscious or trappers and i m mississippi

times got low uhh look how they hate me but copy me possibly i was the one with components and properties to be the greatest of all time but you won geography lottery so i keep kicking flipping tables chosen and favored fuck being major when giant is greater fortune and fame but you fuck for the label truth is what made me settle down settle down i was angry but i m better now niggas talking raising bars mine amongst the stars give it time to level out if you worried about the flow i ll make a beat write you a hook that you repeat even go as far to drop a mixtape that you re do never credit me separately sold slick as giuseppes on slippery floors mop by the buckets that i used to hold while dreaming of plaques and selling out shows multi alumni forever the

see our problem is we don t really know how to stop weve got something started and we see it s going in the wrong direction and i think the difficulty is to borrow an old chinese saying that when the wrong man uses the right means the right means work in the wrong way in other words there is something wrong with the way we think and while that is there everything we do will be a mess now what is it thats wrong now as far as i can see the basic mistake is that weve invented this wonderful system of language and calculation and that it is at once too simple to deal with the complexities in the world and also we are liable to confuse that system of simpleness with the world itself just as we confuse say money with wealth a lot of people are in business to make money instead of wealth when they make the money they dont know what to do with it no wonder we feel cut off from everything alienated frightened of life and death so what has to happen is we have to come back to a view of our own life which is the way we really are an organism functioning in terms of the whole environment with the whole environment instead of this funny little separate personality but how are we going to do that you cant transform yourself you cant make yourself sane you cant make yourself loving you cant make yourself unselfish and yet it is absolutely necessary that we be that way if we are going to hand over the direction of nature to nature its absolutely necessary im not going to say what we should do but simply that before we think of doing it in this critical situation we realize the completely illusory nature of our beings we think we are and with that again to the beings we really are which includes all this outside world no longer left outside
