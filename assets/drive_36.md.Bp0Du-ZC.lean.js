evening mr utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to dinner without relish it was his custom of a sunday when this meal was over to sit close by the fire a volume of some dry divinity on his reading desk until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out the hour of twelve when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed on this night however as soon as the cloth was taken away he took up a candle and went into his business room there he opened his safe took from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope as dr jekyll s will and sat down with a clouded brow to study its contents the will was holograph for mr utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of it it provided not only that in case of the decease of henry jekyll m d d c l l l d f r s etc all his possessions were to pass into the hands of his friend and benefactor edward hyde but that in case of dr jekyll s disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three calendar months the said edward hyde should step into the said henry jekyll s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or obligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the doctor s household this document had long been the lawyer s eyesore it offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life to whom the fanciful was the immodest and hitherto it was his ignorance of mr hyde that had swelled his indignation now by a sudden turn it was his knowledge it was already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could learn no more it was worse when it began to be clothed upon with detestable attributes and out of the shifting insubstantial mists that had so long baffled his eye there leaped up the sudden definite presentment of a fiend i thought it was madness he said as he replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe and now i begin to fear it is disgrace with that he blew out his candle put on a great coat and set forth in the direction of cavendish square that citadel of medicine where his friend the great dr lanyon had his house and received his crowding patients if any one knows it will be lanyon he had thought the solemn butler knew and welcomed him he was subjected to no stage of delay but ushered direct from the door to the dining room where dr lanyon sat alone over his wine this was a hearty healthy dapper red faced gentleman with a shock of hair prematurely white and a boisterous and decided manner at sight of mr utterson he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both hands the geniality as was the way of the man was somewhat theatrical to the eye but it reposed on genuine feeling for these two were old friends old mates both at school and college both thorough respecters of themselves and of each other and what does not always follow men who thoroughly enjoyed each other s company after a little rambling talk the lawyer led up to the subject which so disagreeably pre occupied his mind i suppose lanyon said he you and i must be the two oldest friends that henry jekyll has i wish the friends were younger chuckled dr lanyon but i suppose we are and what of that i see little of him now indeed said utterson i thought you had a bond of common interest we had was the reply but it is more than ten years since henry jekyll became too fanciful for me he began to go wrong wrong in mind and though of course i continue to take an interest in him for old sake s sake as they say i see and i have seen devilish little of the man such unscientific balderdash added the doctor flushing suddenly purple would have estranged damon and pythias this little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to mr utterson they have only differed on some point of science he thought and being a man of no scientific passions he even added it is nothing worse than that he gave his friend a few seconds to recover his composure and then approached the question he had come to put did you ever come across a protege of hisone hyde he asked hyde repeated lanyon no never heard of him since my time that was the amount of information that the lawyer carried back with him to the great dark bed on which he tossed to and fro until the small hours of the morning began to grow large it was a night of little ease to his toiling mind toiling in mere darkness and besieged by questions six o clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently near to mr utterson s dwelling and still he was digging at the problem hitherto it had touched him on the intellectual side alone but now his imagination also was engaged or rather enslaved and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of the night and the curtained room mr enfield s tale went by before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures he would be aware of the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city then of the figure of a man walking swiftly then of a child running from the doctor s and then these met and that human juggernaut trod the child down and passed on regardless of her screams or else he would see a room in a rich house where his friend lay asleep dreaming and smiling at his dreams and then the door of that room would be opened the curtains of the bed plucked apart the sleeper recalled and lo there would stand by his side a figure to whom power was given and even at that dead hour he must rise and do its bidding the figure in these two phases haunted the lawyer all night and if at any time he dozed over it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses or move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly even to dizziness through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city and at every street corner crush a child and leave her screaming and still the figure had no face by which he might know it even in his dreams it had no face or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes and thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer s mind a singularly strong almost an inordinate curiosity to behold the features of the real mr hyde if he could but once set eyes on him he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away as was the habit of mysterious things when well examined he might see a reason for his friend s strange preference or bondage and even for the startling clause of the will at least it would be a face worth seeing the face of a man who was without bowels of mercy a face which had but to show itself to raise up in the mind of the unimpressionable enfield a spirit of enduring hatred from that time forward mr utterson began to haunt the door in the by street of shops in the morning before office hours at noon when business was plenty and time scarce at night under the face of the fogged city moon by all lights and at all hours of solitude or concourse the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post if he be mr hyde he had thought i shall be mr seek and at last his patience was rewarded it was a fine dry night frost in the air the streets as clean as a ballroom floor the lamps unshaken by any wind drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow by ten o clock when the shops were closed the by street was very solitary and in spite of the low growl of london from all round very silent small sounds carried far domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly audible on either side of the roadway and the rumour of the approach of any passenger preceded him by a long time mr utterson had been some minutes at his post when he was aware of an odd light footstep drawing near in the course of his nightly patrols he had long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of a single person while he is still a great way off suddenly spring out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city yet his attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested and it was with a strong superstitious prevision of success that he withdrew into the entry of the court the steps drew swiftly nearer and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street the lawyer looking forth from the entry could soon see what manner of man he had to deal with he was small and very plainly dressed and the look of him even at that distance went somehow strongly against the watcher s inclination but he made straight for the door crossing the roadway to save time and as he came he drew a key from his pocket like one approaching home mr utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed mr hyde i think mr hyde shrank back with a hissing intake of the breath but his fear was only momentary and though he did not look the lawyer in the face he answered coolly enough that is my name what do you want i see you are going in returned the lawyer i am an old friend of dr jekyll smr utterson of gaunt streetyou must have heard my name and meeting you so conveniently i thought you might admit me you will not find dr jekyll he is from home replied mr hyde blowing in the key and then suddenly but still without looking up how did you know me he asked on your side said mr utterson will you do me a favour with pleasure replied the other what shall it be will you let me see your face asked the lawyer mr hyde appeared to hesitate and then as if upon some sudden reflection fronted about with an air of defiance and the pair stared at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds now i shall know you again said mr utterson it may be useful yes returned mr hyde it is as well we have met and a propos you should have my address and he gave a number of a street in soho good god thought mr utterson can he too have been thinking of the will but he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment of the address and now said the other how did you know me by description was the reply whose description we have common friends said mr utterson common friends echoed mr hyde a little hoarsely who are they jekyll for instance said the lawyer he never told you cried mr hyde with a flush of anger i did not think you would have lied come said mr utterson that is not fitting language the other snarled aloud into a savage laugh and the next moment with extraordinary quickness he had unlocked the door and disappeared into the house the lawyer stood awhile when mr hyde had left him the picture of disquietude then he began slowly to mount the street pausing every step or two and putting his hand to his brow like a man in mental perplexity the problem he was thus debating as he walked was one of a class that is rarely solved mr hyde was pale and dwarfish he gave an impression of deformity without any nameable malformation he had a displeasing smile he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and boldness and he spoke with a husky whispering and somewhat broken voice all these were points against him but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust loathing and fear with which mr utterson regarded him there must be something else said the perplexed gentleman there is something more if i could find a name for it god bless me the man seems hardly human something troglodytic shall we say or can it be the old story of dr fell or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus transpires through and transfigures its clay continent the last i think for o my poor old harry jekyll if ever i read satan s signature upon a face it is on that of your new friend round the corner from the by street there was a square of ancient handsome houses now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men map engravers architects shady lawyers and the agents of obscure enterprises one house however second from the corner was still occupied entire and at the door of this which wore a great air of wealth and comfort though it was now plunged in darkness except for the fan light mr utterson stopped and knocked a well dressed elderly servant opened the door is dr jekyll at home poole asked the lawyer i will see mr utterson said poole admitting the visitor as he spoke into a large low roofed comfortable hall paved with flags warmed by a bright open fire and furnished with costly cabinets of oak will you wait here by the fire sir or shall i give you a light in the dining room here thank you said the lawyer and he drew near and leaned on the tall fender this hall in which he was now left alone was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor s and utterson himself was wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in london but to night there was a shudder in his blood the face of hyde sat heavy on his memory he felt a nausea and distaste of life and in the gloom of his spirits he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof he was ashamed of his relief when poole presently returned to announce that dr jekyll was gone out i saw mr hyde go in by the old dissecting room door poole he said is that right when dr jekyll is from home quite right mr utterson sir replied the servant mr hyde has a key your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man poole resumed the other musingly yes sir he do indeed said poole we have all orders to obey him i do not think i ever met mr hyde asked utterson o dear no sir he never dines here replied the butler indeed we see very little of him on this side of the house he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory well good night poole good night mr utterson and the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart poor harry jekyll he thought my mind misgives me he is in deep waters he was wild when he was young a long while ago to be sure but in the law of god there is no statute of limitations ay it must be that the ghost of some old sin the cancer of some concealed disgrace punishment coming pede claudo years after memory has forgotten and self love condoned the fault and the lawyer scared by the thought brooded a while on his own past groping in all the corners of memory lest by chance some jack in the box of an old iniquity should leap to light there his past was fairly blameless few men could read the rolls of their life with less apprehension yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill things he had done and raised up again into a sober and fearful gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing yet avoided and then by a return on his former subject he conceived a spark of hope this master hyde if he were studied thought he must have secrets of his own black secrets by the look of him secrets compared to which poor jekyll s worst would be like sunshine things cannot continue as they are it turns me cold to think of this creature stealing like a thief to harry s bedside poor harry what a wakening and the danger of it for if this hyde suspects the existence of the will he may grow impatient to inherit ay i must put my shoulder to the wheel if jekyll will but let me he added if jekyll will only let me for once more he saw before his mind s eye as clear as a transparency the strange clauses of the will 2","artist_name":"Figure"},{"lyrics":"i know you re not real when everyone thinks

control stimulate the hoes control educating my niggas control control now having said that i ll go back to this document this was a meeting okay this was what he said very soon every american will be required to register their biological property in a national system designed to keep track of the people and that will operate under the ancient system of pledging by such methodology we can compel people to submit to our agenda which will effect our security as a chargeback for our fiat paper currency every american will be forced to register or suffer being unable to work and earn a living they will be our chattel and we will hold the security interest over them forever by operation of the law merchant under the scheme of secured transactions americans by unknowingly or unwittingly delivering the bills of lading to us will be rendered bankrupt and insolvent forever to remain economic slaves through taxation secured by their pledges they will be stripped of their rights and given a commercial value designed to make us a profit and they will be none the wiser for not one man in a million could ever figure our plans and if by accident one or two should figure it out we have in our arsenal plausible deniability after all this is the only logical way to fund government by floating liens and debt to the registrants in the form of benefits and privileges this will inevitably reap to us huge profits beyond our wildest expectations and leave every american a contributor to this fraud which we will call social insurance without realizing it every american will insure us for any loss we may incur and in this manner every american will unknowingly be our servant however begrudgingly the people will become helpless and without any hope for their redemption and we will employ the high office of the president of our dummy corporation to foment this plot against america 28","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"white man told me all i do is jump jump those expectations with

rather hang around a boy who won t commit when someone like them is ready to love you is ready to learn you ready to show you who you are paint you a picture of you through his eyes and convince you that you are indeed art show you the way he s mesmerized the way your broken heart still beats the way it flutters when whole eyes and yours meet the way it silences to express its beat show you how much he realizes you need healing from this hurting i know you i know something about what you ve been through i know some days feel like heavy weights and hearts with protection that you ve failed to break through and i know what it s like to put heart break on hold for the love of your life who forgot relationships take two i know he forgot to say i love you too i know he forgot to stay faithful i know you forgot about the time you promised yourself you d do better but every time you try to leave something keeps pulling you back telling you this is the best you ll ever have in life so you stay the night every night he misses you after remembering your head and how good it works and how good it feels to know no matter how bad it gets you ll always come back i know you and he does too we know the way your stomach drops at the thought of him loving someone better so he knows you won t search for better and i know you deserve better i know you deserve better than to have your spirit bruised i know you deserve someone who empowers you i know just how beautiful you could be if only you could see your own self value and i know you you re a collection of paradox s you re a

that you dont need to failing to realize that before you pour yourself into someone they must first be a vessel to hold and receive you and thats what seems to defeat you because you try to be the healer in ill situations that youre not meant to treat through see through the blind illusions of your own mind games you have to understand that people and times change and you cant walk back into

praise the buddhas as they shine i bow before you as i travel my path to join your ranks i make my full time task for the sake of all beings i seek the enlightened mind that i know i ll reap respect to shantideva and all the others who brought down the dharma for the sisters and brothers i give thanks for this world as a place to learn and for this human body that i know i ve earned and my deepest thanks to all sentient beings for without them there would be no place to learn what i m seeing there s nothing here that s not been said before but i put it down now so that i ll be sure to solidify my own views and i ll be glad if it helps anyone else out too if others disrespect me or give me flak i ll stop and think before i react knowing that they re going through insecure stages i ll take the opportunity to exercise patience i ll see it as a chance to help the other person nip it in the bud before it can worsen a chance for me to be strong and sure as i think on the buddhas who have come before as i praise and respect the good they ve done knowing love can conquer hate in every situation we need other people in order to create the circumstances for the learning that we re here to generate situations that bring up our deepest fears so we can work to release them until they re cleared therefore it only makes sense to thank our enemies despite their intent the bodhisattva path is one of power and strength a strength from within to go the length seeing others are as important as myself i strive for a happiness of mental wealth with the interconnectedness that we share as one every action that we take affects everyone so in deciding for what a situation calls there is a path for the good for all i try to make my every action for that highest good with the altruistic wish to achieve buddhahood so i pledge here before everyone who s listening to try to make my every action for the good of all beings for the rest of my lifetimes and even beyond i vow to do my best to do no harm and in times of doubt i can think on the dharma and the enlightened ones who ve graduated samsara6","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"wake up in the morning pull myself outta bed think about

bus as it swerved from us and came crashing to its side some nights the blood from real cuts feels real nice when it s really mine and if you want it to be real come over for one night and we can really really climb cause blue bridge lights might really burn most bright while we watch that dark lake rise and if you really want to see what really matters most to me just take a real short drive its just a drive into the dark stretch long stretch of night really stretch this shaking mind and this room unlit unheated and the ceiling striped and the dark black blinds i want to know this time if you re really finally mine i need to know that you re not lying and so i want to see you tried and i don t want to hear you say it shouldn t really be this way because i like this way just fine cause there s nothing quite like the blinding light that curtains cast aside and no attempt is made to explain away things that really really really really really are behind you can t hide you can t hide

was so sweet on christmas eve with the snow set deep when we went walking through the pines i had just been fired and her first offer had arrived and the new year would see her flying far away from me though i didn t know it at the time with outstretched hands now she commands a famous figure for every picture and she stands up strong and she demands and they deliver yeah she s a fixture and it s a mixture of dumb jealousy and fear that i might feel should she appear just like it hasn t been three years and there s a distance to her voice over the phone and that s because she stands alone while i m still sitting here girl you see me here on another quiet night i will wait until another indistinguishable day arrives i ll decide where the light s even and bright where my life s sweet as it s slightly disappointedly just gliding softly by and you won t wait for me in some secluded stand of trees some christmas eve some god was kind enough to set aside although i d love you to i m proud of you god knows i m feeling really stupid now for ever having said goodbye  during the fight i said yeah right when you insisted that i visit that you d write now i know you re working hard so i never hear from you and that s fine you look the same on tv as when you were mine i walk in from the kitchen and i finger the remote control i watch you from the distance you go walking through the terminal i remember every instance when you stung me oh you re so lovely oh you re so smart so go turn their heads go knock them dead go break their hearts go break their hearts baby break their hearts and i know you will","artist_name":"Okkervil River"},{"lyrics":"who wrote those lines on the wall let s retrace where they scrawled ancient characters it s 2 00 and your sister s slip it falls and the afternoon crawls across the room and tackles her i don t think that you would sink that ship that s only passing through cause i don t believe that you might be a murderess but i saw inside each small dark eye as it was turning blue all the strength inside to do just what the captain says and hang the rest and moved by the rhyme in the psalm we agreed that it was wrong and to believe in it ooh swooned the wall all night long but a lie s a lie no matter what guy s breath s in it i don t know that i would go that far down some dark avenue with a whispering crew of shadows all protecting it but i saw inside each small white lie as it was turning true the ability to do all things expected of it i don t think that you would sink that ship that s only passing through cause i don t believe that you might be a piratess did you hide inside each small white lie before you turned it true the ability to do all things the captain says oh murderess in the wilderness with your victims all
