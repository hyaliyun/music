the bible says not possible see everyone has a god whether or not its the god of the gospel you might not believe in god but everyone has that one thing thats king even the dictionary defines god as whatever we make supreme because its a theme a thread its inside of all human beings the fact that we all worship and no its not just about singing now i know youre like jeff i dont worship i put that on the shelf but i say technically we all worship we just worship ourselves see we all worship something to an object were all liable ladies to some your boyfriend is your god and cosmo is your bible yet we mock and we laugh at the israelites golden calf but we do the same right back it just looks different than that so question whats on your throne what do you chase so you dont feel alone so what defines you what do you give ultimate worth and what if taken will bring ultimate hurt now see that is your god and all of us weve sacrifice deep joy for shallow happiness to be honest we look like fools were like full grown adults in the kiddie pool going oh my goodness guys this is like so cool because were slaves to our possessions we are always craving something new reality check if you cant give it up you dont own it it owns you and thats why the bible it says were all spiritual prostitutes in fact it says were worse because at least prostitutes get paid for their works all we get paid is a hearse thats why worship is not just behavior it goes way into our core so ask yourself what is your god what do you bow down before for example some of us we dont worship god but we worship what he said we got theology in your head but in your hearts poor pitiful naked and dead or some of us worship in stadiums while some of us worship in bars some of us worship our possessions while some of us worship our cars see some of us worship science while some of us worship the arts but i dont care what clothes your idols wearingthe disease is the heart or my favorite is those guys who say jeff im a man because im in control okay then tell me why cant you stop having sex with your hand while staring at your macbook pro or what about those guys who trade their wives for their jobs at work give more time to their boss then their actual wivess needs or hurts and ladiesladies no guy can love you more than jesus already has so stop putting your worth in magic mike hes so much better than that now i know what youre thinkingyoure probably thinking jeff are you saying we should hate money hate alcohol and never have sex no but im not saying that god created those all to be enjoyed in their proper context but i wanna transition i want to make a spiritual incision can you really say these things are the ultimate purpose of living i mean instead of worshiping the creator of you and i weve all said screw you god ill take your stuff but you can die but that trade is terrible trading god for man its like god offers us water and we say but god this is such good sand or my friends theyll say jeff a god that requires me to give up something i just cant fathom yet most of us seem fine giving up everything for a quick orgasm i mean am i the only one who s felt the gnawing within am i the only one who s felt the weight of my own sin but see heres whats unique go ahead and critique but if you hear anything hear this one thing that i speak where we exchanged ourselves for god thinking we could be him he exchanged himself for us absorbing all our sin i mean god literally put on flesh and do you see how we treated him the ultimate war veteran because he was killed for our freedom nonetheless he was thinking of you and me with every whip that beat him knowing full well wed still go nah i dont really need him but like a father he couldnt bear his children to not be free so it s up that tree he paid our fee for specks of dirt like you and me so my plea is let him restore his proper place i promise you he loves you right now just trust in his grace because before i leave ill leave you with this what are those other things took nails in their wrists or how about when was the last time money or sex forgave you whens the last time your boyfriend set you free from all youve enslaved to see what else died so that you could be made new or when was the last time the world promised satisfaction and actually came through 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"people triumphant the fact that slavery is dead but last time i checked it it just changed clothes instead and so casinos malls strip clubs looking like modern day temples acting like were self sufficient so we make ourselves central but were slaves to things possessions and screens slave to money which is why no one lives within their means broken hopeless spiritually homeless but we keep going on with our lives as if no one seems to notice how was that working for you youre satisfied bro you got joy how does it feel chasing stuff thats always a little faster than you how come the image you used to stare at years ago doesnt even register anymore i mean the biggest lie in the world is ill be satisfied if i just have a little more so were addicted to sex were addicted to power we call ourselves men but really were just cowards because the apple looks sweet but then it turns sour how come every time we buy into an idol were the ones that get devoured i mean you say youre not a slave but here is something to chew you ever wondered why pictures of naked girls got so much power over you it is a question what if kids acted realistic about what they wanted to be when they grow up so at birth they show up and say hey mom at age of 11 i want to become a slave i want to make porn to my slave master and then die in that grave and by 16 i want to be so wrapped up in what others say about me in school that ill do anything just once theyll tell me that im cool and by college i want to worship at the alter of sex not care about treating a girl right just caring about what girl is next and then ill graduate get married and get a job and start to save treat my job like my wife and treat my wife like my slave and then have some pretty trophy kids and live in pretty trophy bliss but make sure my kids know that if sportscenter comes on they need to quickly split because those guys throwing the football with eye black on their skin yeah my whole week depends on if they win comfort power sex alcohol religion pleasure all good things unless turned into an ultimate thing because the problem is that what you do is that your heart needs to be made new because if you dont crush your idols then your idols will crush you you know the definition of insanity is doing the same thing expecting different results and by that definition most of us are insane because we run to the same filth even though it hurt us yesterday and say come on please satisfy me today and jesus said you try to gain your life youll lose it you lose your life youll gain it but weve all traded in the creator for something created thinking that just because youve got a nice house and a car you made it now realizing if youre solely right youre not different than a fish bro because you just got baited because idols they over promise and under deliver they operate by deceiving an idol is when you look at something and say if i have that then ill have meaning and if we dont put god in his rightful place well put something else there and so we make good things things and then go into despair and just like elijah called down the fire and the alter exploded into flames no there is only one god that comes through when you need him and jesus is his name because when youre sick and thirsty toilet water might be attractive but its you got something better bro than toilet water looks nasty because an idol is dead it doesnt live an idol takes it never gives so repent get on your knees and then make your hearts full of diseases you want to know what a true man looks like then look to jesus","artist_name":"Jefferson Bethke"},{"lyrics":"disney movies and chick flicks they ve put us in a weird position they distorted our reality because we forget they re actually fiction because in marriage we either get better or bitter either joy or remorses what we re doing isn t working just like at the rate of divorces so how s your marriage i mean come on let s be honest marriage seems more like a prison than the paradise they were promised we thought marriage was supposed to fulfill us and make us happy not lonely but the truth is god s first priority is making you holy you say no one told me it feels so odd that dating feels like a vacation while marriage feels like a job yet the secret of joy if we just pull back to faade is realizing most problems arise when we elevate our spouse to god without knowing it we fulfilled romans 1 25 by our actions extremes of truth about god for a lie we ve exchanged god for lesser created things it s like a husband trading his wife for a 2d image on a screen hoping it ll set us free justifying the fumes we re choking because if your marriage rests on anything but jesus it s resting on something broken yet guys continually sacrifice their marriage on the altar of sex and lust i mean if our dollars were honest they d stay in pleasure we trust so men grow up put down the controller how about you lead her with grace instead of trying to control her now i ve never been married but i m a product of one that was nonexistent so don t tell me i don t understand the pain don t tell me i don t get it so for the singles become friends first before you ever become lovers pursue jesus as your foundation before you get under the covers because believe me a strong friendship before marriage will make a good marriage after marriage isn t just sex it s conversation and laughter i mean some spouses barely even like each other and the marriage seems like a dead end you might share a checkbook and a house but are you actually friends i mean if marriage isn t a commitment then what s the point of the vows we say til death do us part really means until the feelings go away like i ll stay with him but only until it gets tough and my love shifts but i say imagine if a parent took that perspective with their kids like can t you see it the minute the kid spills something on the floor the mom s saying forget it i don t even love you anymore no it s just like marriage to last you need the strength from above because it s not love that sustains the promise it s the promise that sustains the love i mean think about it out of anyone who s actually had the right to leave god had every reason in the world that he still came for you and me and on the cross he paid it all took our shame and set us free when he could ve called the legions of angels he chose to stay on that tree from the cross he looks you in the eye and says i m taking this from my bride when you trust in me you no longer have to hide because of me it is finished you ve been made new you re spotless you re blameless there s no sin in you because his death was a proposal he wanted you no matter the cost where some guys propose on the knee jesus proposed on a cross so read ephesians 5 whether husband or wife wife honor your husband husbands give up your life just like jesus gave himself up for his bride the church so men lead by serving by putting her first so die to self put your flesh on a life sentence because you don t fall out of love as much as you fall out of repentance7","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"throw the body

disgusted so tonight looks like sex will be our topic of discussion now see sex isn t evil for marriage is why god made it but i know you re like come on man that s too outdated this is 2011 bro we do it for recreation and hey if you re in college you do it while you re wasted but i wanna question this logic i wanna pop off the seal i wanna question something that we think is already a done deal so take a rape victim for example and once it s revealed when her bruises go away is she totally healed no the damage is lasting you can see it in her eyes but if it was just abused recreation why did it ruin her life i mean if sex is just for fun why does it take such a toll maybe it s cause you don t just have sex with a body you have sex with a soul which means for me there ain t no premarital lovin and it ain t just because i don t want a baby in the oven it s because i m staying pure until the day that i m a husband but see this wasn t always me that s a guarantee let s go back in the past see who i used to be now growing up i never learned how to treat a lady if i learned one thing from my dad it was leave the mom ditch the baby now i don t say that to get sympathy i say that to be real because according to stats about 40 of you know how that feels so i let the tv show me what the music already told me no dad at home so i was letting mtv mold me and they sold me which is why my life revolved around what girl i could get next my life revolved around this girl named sex sure i d get at her on the text but i ve got to confess it seems the longer we dated the bigger the mess but then my girlfriend was late on that time of the month if you know what i mean you ll understand when i say my heart sunk i started to think about abortion man i started to butter it up but it s funny they don t make condoms for sin you can t just cover it up it was just a scare but i knew a father i don t wanna be it s funny how i was pro life until it happened to me so dudes think twice before you desire her just cause she s hot cause the truth is your body makes a promise whether you do or not sorry i digress though let s get back to the topic how there s some dudes who pressure her even when she says stop it you re not a man you re just a boy that can shave and you put on a good cover cause if you don t respect her when she says no you certainly don t love her so how about you start studying her heart and stop studying her booty or maybe invest the same amount of time in her that you do in call of duty cause what makes you think you can get this girl and all of a sudden get naughty cause you should have to touch her heart and her mind first before you ever touch her body cause she longs to be accepted she longs to be loved so she gives herself up to another guy s lust she thinks it feels good at first but then she gets bitter cause the promise of satisfaction it never delivers she s like i don t want to but it s just too tempting so she keeps opening up the present just to find that it s empty and then she starts to get confused she keeps getting rejected by all these dudes they tell her on a scale of ten she s a two but that ain t true if she only knew that jesus he loves and accepts us even when you don t want him he ll never reject us he heals us from that sin that totally infects us and he does what condoms can t he emotionally protect us and i know some of you hearing this are gonna want to indict me but we gotta think rightly so i ll ask politely can you really say this isn t even true just slightly i mean we touched the forbidden fruit not to realize it s poison ivy and now we re numb and we re itching and we ve got a distorted psyche you don t think you just do it like your name was nike not realizing that the consequences of your actions are oh so pricey so this last story though is for those who think they re too dirty this last story is for those who think they re unworthy read john chapter eight the woman caught in adultery the religious leaders throw her naked in the temple while she yells don t murder me they say jesus the law commands us to stone this woman and you hear the hate in their tone jesus pauses and then says whoever is without sin you can cast the first stone i mean can you imagine the sound silence all around you hear footsteps walk away you hear stones hit the ground and then jesus kneels down the woman thought it was her demise he lifts up her face you see the grace in his eyes he says i don t condemn you go and sin no more i love you i accept you mercy is yours but if you re anything like me you re like no that can t be why would he ever die for me see but then i saw that scene where i was redeemed he reached out and touched me and said jeff you re free instantly i was wearing the brightest robe i d ever seen i was perfectly spotless i was perfectly clean so bright in fact man i thought i d go blind i said whose this is he said actually it s mine so think twice before you eat what society feeds us come follow the king his name is jesus7","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"so many ways to die so many ways to stay alive but if you wouldn t mind to wait a while you could give another day a try

deserted yearnings come to life surface from the dark to realize how in a vast field she runs from the deepest valley past the sun  all this time witness to the changing tides all the while finding ways how to make sense of all the lights to shake the winds to shake the currents and the rigid hives we re living in all this time witness to the changing tides idle as a wave moving out at sea

marsha for more than two months two months and all he had to show was three dog eared letters and two very expensive long distance phone calls true when school had ended and she d returned to wisconsin and he to locust pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity she would date occasionally but merely as amusement she would remain faithful but lately waldo had begun to worry he had trouble sleeping at night and when he did he had horrible dreams he lay awake at night tossing and turning underneath his pleated quilt protector tears welling in his eyes as he pictured marsha her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some neanderthal finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion it was more than the human mind could bear visions of marsha s faithlessness haunted him daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts and the thing was they wouldn t understand how she really was he waldo alone understood this he had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche he had made her smile she needed him and he wasn t there the idea came to him on the thursday before the mummers parade was scheduled to appear he d just finished mowing and edging the edelsons lawn for a dollar fifty and had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from marsha there was nothing but a circular from the amalgamated aluminum company of america inquiring into his awning needs at least they cared enough to write it was a new york company you could go anywhere in the mails then it struck him he didn t have enough money to go to wisconsin in the accepted fashion true but why not mail himself it was absurdly simple he would ship himself parcel post special delivery the next day waldo went to the supermarket to purchase the necessary equipment he bought masking tape a staple gun and a medium sized cardboard box just right for a person of his build he judged that with a minimum of jostling he could ride quite comfortably a few air holes some water perhaps some midnight snacks and it would probably be as good as going tourist by friday afternoon waldo was set he was thoroughly packed and the post office had agreed to pick him up at three o clock he d marked the package fragile and as he sat curled up inside resting on the foam rubber cushioning he d thoughtfully included he tried to picture the look of awe and happiness on marsha s face as she opened her door saw the package tipped the deliverer and then opened it to see her waldo finally there in person she would kiss him and then maybe they could see a movie if he d only thought of this before suddenly rough hands gripped his package and he felt himself borne up he landed with a thud in a truck and was off marsha bronson had just finished setting her hair it had been a very rough weekend she had to remember not to drink like that bill had been nice about it though after it was over he d said he still respected her and after all it was certainly the way of nature and even though no he didn t love her he did feel an affection for her and after all they were grown adults oh what bill could teach waldo but that seemed many years ago sheila klein her very very best friend walked in through the porch screen door and into the kitchen oh gawd it s absolutely maudlin outside ach i know what you mean i feel all icky marsha tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk outer edge sheila ran her finger over some salt grains on the kitchen table licked her finger and made a face i m supposed to be taking these salt pills but she wrinkled her nose they make me feel like throwing up marsha started to pat herself under the chin an exercise she d seen on television god don t even talk about that she got up from the table and went to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and blue vitamins want one supposed to be better than steak and then attempted to touch her knees i don t think i ll ever touch a daiquiri again she gave up and sat down this time nearer the small table that supported the telephone maybe bill ll call she said to sheila s glance sheila nibbled on a cuticle after last night i thought maybe you d be through with him i know what you mean my god he was like an octopus hands all over the place she gestured raising her arms upwards in defense the thing is after a while you get tired of fighting with him you know and after all i didn t really do anything friday and saturday so i kind of owed it to him you know what i mean she started to scratch sheila was giggling with her hand over her mouth i ll tell you i felt the same way and even after a while here she bent forward in a whisper i wanted to now she was laughing very loudly it was at this point that mr jameson of the clarence darrow post office rang the doorbell of the large stucco colored frame house when marsha bronson opened the door he helped her carry the package in he had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed and left with a fifteen cent tip that marsha had gotten out of her mother s small beige pocketbook in the den what do you think it is sheila asked marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back she stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in the middle of the living room i dunno inside the package waldo quivered with excitement as he listened to the muffled voices sheila ran her fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the center of the carton why don t you look at the return address and see who it s from waldo felt his heart beating he could feel the vibrating footsteps it would be soon marsha walked around the carton and read the ink scratched label ah god it s from waldo that schmuck said sheila waldo trembled with expectation well you might as well open it said sheila both of them tried to lift the staple flap ah sst said marsha groaning he must have nailed it shut they tugged on the flap again my god you need a power drill to get this thing open they pulled again you can t get a grip they both stood still breathing heavily why don t you get a scissor said sheila marsha ran into the kitchen but all she could find was a little sewing scissor then she remembered that her father kept a collection of tools in the basement she ran downstairs and when she came back up she had a large sheet metal cutter in her hand this is the best i could find she was very out of breath here you do it i i m gonna die she sank into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape and the end of the cardboard flap but the blade was too big and there wasn t enough room god damn this thing she said feeling very exasperated then smiling i got an idea what said marsha just watch said sheila touching her finger to her head inside the package waldo was so transfixed with excitement that he could barely breathe his skin felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart beating in his throat it would be soon sheila stood quite upright and walked around to the other side of the package then she sank down to her knees grasped the cutter by both handles took a deep breath and plunged the long blade through the middle of the package through the masking tape through the cardboard through the cushioning and right through the center of waldo jeffers head which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun8","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"say the word and there is light say the word and dead bones rise every start and end hangs on your voice for your word never returns void

do you mean i just went through the exact same thing mind was lost for a whole different reason i lost my love because of cheatin started goin through the streets all day and night i guess greedy best describes such an appetite i wish i had her back but it remains a wish i guess a bird in the hand beats two in the bush i d like to thank you girl for teaching me love because all in all i had a ball

one love you re lucky just to have just one love one love one love you re lucky just to have just one one love one love you re lucky just to have just one love now i think it s bout time that we break
