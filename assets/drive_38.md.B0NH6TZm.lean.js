gentle or as clean as all the others leaving its scars all in the after hours of some greenpoint bar i told you i can t listen baby about the 4th time you were a lady and how your forthrightness betrayed a secret shyness stripped away by days of being hailed as your highness and what s new pussycat is that you were once a lioness they cut your claws out kitten not everyone s keen on lighting candle 17 the party s done the cake s all gone the plates are clean the chauffeur s leering from the cheerless mezzanine and in just one year the straight world can pay to see what they have been missing you were caught kissing 8 chinese brothers but there s a reason why the last is smiling wide and sitting higher than the others stinking with charm and he says lets get lost let them send out

right words to say always seemed to stay just out of reach well i should not have thought it strange that growing causes growing pains cause the more we learn the more we know we don t know anything but still it seems a tragic fate living with this quiet ache the constant strain for what remains just out of reach chorus we are reaching for the future we are reaching for the past and no matter what we have we reach for more we are desperate to discover what is just beyond our grasp but maybe that s what heaven is for there are times i can t forget dressed up in my sunday best trying not to squirm and to maybe learn a bit of what the preacher preached and later lying in the dark i felt a stirring in my heart and though i longed to see what could not be seen i still believed i guess i shouldn t think it odd until we see the face of god the yearning deep within us tells us there s more to come so when we taste of the divine it leaves us hungry every time for one more taste of what awaits when heaven s gates are reached chorus i believe that s what heaven is for there s a time i can recall four years old and three feet tall trying to touch the stars and the cookie jar and both

your heart that the queen is dead yeah she told me she was sick of all the hospital food and of doctors distant relatives draining her blood she said i know i m dying but i m not finished just yet and i m dying for a drink and for a cigarette so we hatched a plan to book ourselves a cheap hotel in the centre of the city and to raise some hell lay waste to all the clubs and then when everyone else

to chase around a legend that i fucking invented while i m neglecting everybody that i love and respected because i hate the thought of coming in second and i don t want to do no second guessing when it comes to progressing because i really couldn t stomach regretting my effort when i m at the end and i m assessing if i could have done better i better be able to be it than never or be the best ever but if somehow i m really that special then i m about to deal with mad pressure i fear that when i finish my assessment i mma be in depression because i ll see a lot of me is regressing it s obvious to me that to be the best a lot of me is repressing itself i wonder what i ll see in reflections i wonder if i ll run into a woman cool but come in second or if i m bound to be the fool at the
