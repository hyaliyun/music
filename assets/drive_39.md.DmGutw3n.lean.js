except for my eyes everyone in the fire pretends their not burning they just keep digging holes and collecting their pay sometimes before a figure collapses as they begin to smoke they point at the sky my father is one of the engineers to help build a lake in oklahoma with a thousand boats sank there they set them both on fire another old man no relation to me climbed up on a roof to look at the moon the subtlety of her form was terrible to me he threw himself off the roof though it was only two floors i m only three miles from the place i was brought up i m only six feet from the spot where i ll die the people around me are blistered and hidden there s blood on the ground but i don t think it s mine my eyes cannot focus for the strain i put on them there s a litter of smoke like dogs in the sky the canon established overlooking the valley pointing at the moon though i am not sure why the king is not dead he is just made immortal so is his crown he continues to lead the king made immortal has human eyes that he took from his daughter so he could continue to see  by sheer force of will i will be here tomorrow i won t go anywhere there s no reason to stay the moons yellow light is neither subtle nor brutal but a patient reflection of the inferno to come the sun is the same as his daughter the moon neither admits it but both are ashamed i m as far from the one as i can be without freezing and as close to the other as is possible now the land in the winter is festooned with rockets they won t leave for me though i am sure i am next they are not a judgement though i am sure i am righteous their corduroy shoulders and the scepter of same slouching towards something in the direction we came king s eyes renew like his other children his daughter without eyes sits here

lives will not be lived in vain when this is all said and done we spent this life on the run judged by the company we keep our language buried inside these lungs that keep us alive we breathe so selfishly promises we plan to break are made in whispered voices cause our despair knows many names we make mistakes but we apologize with roses we never stop to smell along the way pre chorus these

how to live this way pushed so far to the edge we teeter just on the brink you can lead me to the bloodbath but you can t make me drink as these machines feed on the tears of broken lives and dying

the front steps which of course led him inside now hotels are quite like people no two exactly the same and this one had such a magical past the angel found himself quite entertained the foyer still had an elegance that the years could not disguise and the shadows of christmas eves long disappeared this night still gently glided by for in this hotel here side by side the past and the present dwelled and the ghosts who lived here not only lived they honestly lived well the lobby had a steinway piano that was steeped in memories and some said duke ellington s fingers still lingered on those keys there was a grand palace ballroom where princesses had once waltzed whose beauty and sense of style the newspapers would constantly exhault the ghosts of rockefellers and vanderbilts still met at their christmas eve charity balls raising money not for themselves but raising it for all now these spirits of course could not be seen by any human eyes but each one smiled at the angel when they saw him walking by and these ghosts reminded the angel how every human waiting to be born and every life that had already left when it was tired out and worn were connected by those alive right now which gave the living quite a trust to pass on what was best and good inside of each of us now within each guest room he heard many hearts and behind each heart there was a life and the angel carefully read them all with the next hour of that night when he reached the grand palace ballroom it was behind closed mahogany doors and when the angel was passing by it he could hear music begin once more it seemed that since this room was built musicians did permanently reside and then the angel did what we all would do he went to look inside and there he found such a majestic orchestra to please all it would be enough but then someone plugged a guitar in and the volume it crept up so with a song inspired by mozart s famous queen of the night the orchestra added the word winter and some notes some fog some lights","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"o come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant o come ye o come ye to bethlehem come and behold him born the king of angels o come let us adore him o come

us so but the angel he could clearly see that all was not as it appeared to be for on this night as snow clouds gathered that man wondered if that all really mattered and on this night inside his home he realized that he was alone and he asked himself what his life had meant how all these years they had been spent and how he could feel his life such a waste when he had every dream that he had chased but then the angel whispered in his ear and in his mind the man heard clear tell me one wish that you have granted tell me one life you ve enchanted tell me one of these things that you have done but the man could not recall a single one he was close to no one this thing he did know well there was one person but that was long ago and though that someone had been far more than a friend it

lay thinking there below us the trees grew clumps of trees raised families of trees and they as proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away the sun was hot and the sun was bright down in the valley below where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go there in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned our greatest reason for being here our bodies moved and burned there on our mountain bed of leaves we learned lifes reason why people laugh and love and dream they fight they hate to die the smell of your hair i know is still there if most of our leaves are blown our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown your shape and form is dim but plain there on our mountain bed i see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head i learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams to conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas i stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land and i know why farms and cities are built by hot warm nervous hands  i crossed many states just to stand here now my face all hot with tears i crossed city and valley desert and stream to bring my body here my history and future blaze bright in me and all my joy and pain go through my head on our mountain bed where i smell your hair again all this day long i linger here and on in through the night my greeds desires my cravings hopes my dreams inside me fight my loneliness healed my emptiness filled i walk above all pain back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"have mercy have mercy have mercy people listen now you know what it means to be left alone have mercy people do you know what it means to
