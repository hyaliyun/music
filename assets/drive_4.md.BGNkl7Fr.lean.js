out i was down on my luck got tired a roamin and bummin around so i started thumbin back east toward my home town made a lot of miles the first two days and i figured i d be home in week if my luck held out this way but the third night i got stranded way out of town at a cold lonely crossroads rain was pourin down i was hungry and freezin done caught a chill when the lights of a big semi topped the hill lord i sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on and i climbed in that cab where i knew it d be warm at the wheel sit a big man he weighed about two ten he stuck out his hand and said with a grin big joe s the name i told him mine and he said the name of my rig is phantom 309 i asked him why he called his rig such a name he said son this old mack can put em all to shame there ain t a driver or a rig a runnin any line ain t seen nothin but taillights from phantom 309 well we rode and talked the better part of the night when the lights of a truck stop came in sight he said i m sorry son this is as far as you go cause i gotta make a turn just on up the road well he tossed me a dime as he pulled her in low and said have yourself a cup on old big joe when joe and his rig roared out in the night in nothin flat he was clean out of sight well i went inside and ordered me a cup told the waiter big joe was settin me up aw you coulda heard a pin drop it got deathly quiet and the waiter s face turned kinda white well did i say something wrong i said with a halfway grin he said naw this happens every now and then ever driver in here knows big joe but son let me tell you what happened about ten years ago at the crossroads tonight where you flagged him down there was a bus load of kids comin from town and they were right in the middle when big joe topped the hill it could have been slaughter but he turned his wheel well joe lost control went into a skid and gave his life to save that bunch a kids and there at that crossroads was the end of the line for big joe and phantom 309 but every now and then some hiker ll come by and like you big joe ll give em a ride here have another cup and forget about the dime keep it as a souvenir from big joe and phantom 309","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"wibble gal uh gal gal gal gal woah wibble gal gal wobble gal gal wibble wobble wibble wobble wobble bend ova bend ova bend ova bend ova bend ova bend ova back way

birds in a cage rats in the belly snakes in the grass bats in the belfry about the ocean that professed love to ishmael while siftin through the serpent like intestines of a sick whale beneath the sleep like veil i read the stomach lining of the beast like braille and walk the street feelin like my feet might fail that that s how i learn you can do it too  i m learnin not to hold my tongue but how to hold a tune with a drop a golden sun leakin from an open wound below the full moon reposin in the womb stickin acupuncture pins in your thick skull balloon i make my way through the forest and chart progress followin the queen runnin with sharp objects stop catch your breath set the hatchet down dig a hole and bury it god bless the poet proletariat the lowly lost laureate down on both knees chokin back tears while the world moves at full speed you give em time they ll pilfer the village blind what s ill is they re building shrines to realists and philistines and hide shame with pride i m guilty of the same sin born with the same snake attached at the brain stem strange beautiful things losin their wings from heaven s promised heights to the crucible flames listen birds in a cage rats

tree i named you can feel the sorrow i can feel the shame cause there s no one laughing round here no more but he i flew back to the coast on new year s day little plane tossed round by a southerly and when i stepped outside the streets were clean but i know deep down lies undiscovered past the bone foundations of a town corrupted under creaking piers under iron cover past the concrete crown of a million lovers past strutting and swagger under coreless rubble past torn down shanties of forgotten troubles through its ills and evils past rants and ravings lies the cold dark soul of an emerald

children mustn t know this is adults only adults only walking through the streets i could feel its sting metal blue snakes screaming round this head i m in keeps railing all the way to bed and from the time it sleeps to its dawn awake city s dreams rang out like a melody i finally recognise the tune he said  through fears and fervour past lies and secrets of ink stained panic stricken five star heathens under storms of hell through tropical fevers excitement of the first days of bushfire seasons all those planning disasters monuments to the masters and the dog dark dealings of its backroom bastards every long lost dream every failed endeavour every ice beer trail of a rum rebellion now i huddle cause it feels a pity watching new year s colours rain down on a city where our beautiful beaches suffer photo ops to watch schizophrenic tourists get shot by cops generation of kids with the toughest teeth still haunted by visions of chalk in ink where dearest little old ladies die afraid and alone now surrounded by yuppies small bars and coke i children mustn t know that we re living in a city that s built on bones hola amigo please enjoy this city before it explodes here we here we
