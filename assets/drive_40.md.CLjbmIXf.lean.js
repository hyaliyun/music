were long cool of a temperate breeze from dark skies to wet grass we fell in a field it seems now a thousand summers passed when our kite lines first crossed we tied em into knots but to finally fly apart we had to cut them off since then it s been a book you read in reverse so you understand less as the pages turn or a movie so crass and awkwardly cast that even i could be the star i don t look back much as a rule and all this way before murder was cool but your memory is here and i d like it to stay warm light on a winter s day over the ramparts you tossed the scent of your skin and some

wave baby don t go away come here and there s kids playing guns in the street and one s pointing his tree branch at me so i put my hands up i say enough is enough if you walk away i ll walk away i found a liquid cure for my land locked blues it will pass away like a slow parade it s leaving but i don t know how soon and the world s got me dizzy again you d think after 22 years i d be used to the spin and it only feels worse when i stay in one place so i m always pacing around or walking away and i keep drinking the ink from my pen and i m balancing history books up on my head but it all boils down to one quotable phrase if you love something give it away a good woman will pick you apart a box full of suggestions for your possible heart but you may be offended and you may be afraid but don t walk away don t walk away we made love on the living room floor with the noise in the background from a televised war and in that deafening pleasure i thought i heard someone say if we walk away they ll walk away but greed is a bottomless pit and our freedom s a joke we re just taking a piss and the whole world must watch the sad comic display if you re still free start runnin away i ve grown tired of holding this pose i feel more like a stranger each time i come home so i m making a deal with the devils of fame sayin let me walk away please you ll be free child once you have died from the shackles of language and measurable time and then we can trade places play musical graves till then walk away walk away walk away walk away so i m up at dawn putting on my shoes i just want

like rightin smunks of religion i pay homage to bondage and good will with a feel and stay up in a prime just for stacks like wilt the stilt and in the process i like to turn women to objects penthouse to hen house of birds livin in projects i don t discriminate on the basis of race or the place that you stay that s hardly a chick i won t inseminate i spread the legs of college chicks featherweights and solid chicks i make em face the snake but i never taste the bottomlips i poke em with the obelisk and flee from the scene let me explain then you ll see what i mean cause as much as

you go i ve never felt so helpless it s outta both our control you told me how you wanted to travel next year you ll go and your body had become fragile not once did you lose your soul we were told it was progressin and you had less than a week true love is every tear when we told you we had to leave and how we would converse and not once did we need to speak then one day in late october you passed away in your sleep i been cryin when i think about it i miss your smile i miss your laugh and now i live without it i told you music was my passion and you never doubted and people tell me they relate but nah i truly doubt it remember cryin on your grave and yellin up to you how did i lose my way i won t forget that summer were some of my darkest days was asking for a sign sat in my tears and prayed when i saw the sign you sent me that day was forever changed i know i know i shoulda been a better me would blame me when we argue i said things i didn t mean me and you are who our issues should have always been between so i m sorry for the lack of communication from me i just wish that you were here so you could watch me win a grammy but more importantly to build a family i hope i make you proud and become everything i can be i hope they play it loud and send this letter where i can t reach sincerely mark  and i said ohh please grant me the serenity to accept everything i
