sure you were mine and before time demands our goodbye can you sing me a last lullaby it s been a while since i last dreamt barely remember what it s like to dream finding it hard to get to sleep too stressed and there ain t anyone to sing a lullaby to me pretend shit doesn t get to me and i suffer in silence when i m hurting a man s problems are his own and it s my burden tossing and turning trying to get to sleep but i find it hard to switch off when my mind s working i ponder on things i shouldn t bother with off the rails my train of thought s wandering sick of pretending to be so happy all the while my anxiety eats away at me my skin crawls i look up to the sky and it falls the walls close in and it s as if all the good in my life disappears in an instant happiness is so distant so seeing the ones who i love the ones who love me but i don t wanna tell em how i feel in case they judge me it s just me wish i could let somebody in but i ain t ever been too trusting all the times i have laid in your light when your love kept me safe through the night all the time i was sure you were mine and before time demands our goodbye can you sing me a last lullaby i ve barely had any sleep when i get up sick of all these nightmares and these night terrors like it s only when i m leathered that i sleep better might sleep better when i get up i m weak it just makes my day harder i wonder if it would ve been any different if i had a father that i knew could it have helped shape the way that i grew but the point of things i never have went from being a reason for the things that i do to just being an excuse that i d use i ve gotta take responsibility for the things i do find something other than negativity for my fuel but i feed off it even when i don t seem bothered i hide everything that s going on inside guess it s been a while since i ve been honest i need help but i deny it and even lie to myself like i m fine all the times i have laid in your light when your love kept me safe through the night all the time i was sure you were mine and before time demands our goodbye can you sing me a last lullaby  i just wish someone would tell me it would be ok but pessimism leads me to believe that it won t to see even a glimmer of hope in the darkness is hard and depression is a slippery slope i don t wanna do what my dad did with a rope though so i carry on even though it s hard to the only thing that s definite is death and things always change as long as you give em a chance to all the times i have laid in your light when your love kept me safe through the night all the time i was sure you were mine and before time demands our goodbye can you sing me a last lullaby all the times i have laid in your light when your love kept me safe through the night all the time i was sure you were mine and before time demands our goodbye can you sing me a last lullaby 46","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"not thinkin it through that s the way that i be and

my feet on the ground and i just can t seem to get my feet on the ground wherever there is a ho there s bound to be a pimp the pimp supplies his bitches with some tricks that they can tempt a sucker will spend his money til he ain t got nothin left instead of blaming the bitch he needs to blame it on himself it wouldn t be a ho if it wasn t for the tricks but i suggest we keep em so a pimp can keep his bitch it need to be understood there wouldn t be one without the other so why in the fuck these folks keep trying to sweat a muthafucka jealous sucker just maaaaad they can t hang with the pimp thang looking to sprinkle some salt in a pimp s game how in the fuck do you figure that pimpin is dead when nigga you know it s alive pimpin is misunderstood by those who can t that s why they

town for someone s birthday or maybe he makes trouble everywhere but as much he resists the conversation between the rivers and the freeways he knows it s always there as the northwest passage sits somewhere below me as i sleep i dream of captains and explorers eating boots when i ask if i can join them and they offer one to me i wake up as my home comes into view so i reach out down for my notebook to see what impressions could be spun but it s just buildings and a million swimming pools so i leaf back through the pages to see where i am from or for some crumbling map of what it s leading to and i find that the hero in this song that i am writing doesn t know he s just an image of myself but as much he resists the conversation between the rivers and the freeways he s somehow always asking them for help  i want to make out all the signs i ve been ignoring how the trees reach for the sky or in the length of someone s hair cause when you don t know where you are going any

had and i ain t the type who likes to be alone now i m tryin to move along and i felt it difficult to stay strong but dark days always brighten up if the fight in ya keeps movin on a couple months after all of this i bumped into another girl i knew had a couple dates in high school a type of girl you don t forget simply beautiful we talked for a little bit we took some time out and reminisced and i forgot about my dark days she taught me heartbreak can lead to happiness when i was down and had no faith she showed me everything is okay my soul mate i never would of thought a break up could

never tried to change himself beat her to a pulp and make her blame herself i tried to talk to her mama you don t have to stay just pack your bags and go you can walk away she tell me about this pain hoping i d never experience it baby boy love is some serious shit i pray for change eventually it came like rays of light after days of rain she turned her life around walked away never to return

three hots and a cot in here but i got half my muthafuckin squad in here  they got razor wire fifteen feet high we eat in groups of five with plastic knives plastic forks plastic spoons see our kids on sunday afternoons collect call to my mama send me a box cds magazines drawers and socks people get the box everybody gets locked phone calls television everything just stops food here s horrible

and the shouts and the cheers we sailed off for gallipoli how well i remember that terrible day when the blood stained the sand and the water and how in that hell that they called suvla bay we were

blew us right back to australia and the band played waltzing matilda as we stopped to bury our slain and we buried ours and the turks buried theirs then it started all over again now those who were living did their best to survive in that mad world of death blood and fire and for seven long weeks i kept myself alive while the corpses around me piled higher  then a big turkish shell knocked me arse over tit and when i awoke in my hospital bed and saw what it had done christ i wished i was dead never knew there were worse things than dying and no more i ll go waltzing matilda to the green bushes so far and near for to hang tent and pegs a man needs two legs no more waltzing matilda for me so they collected the cripples the wounded and maimed and they shipped us back home to australia the legless the armless the blind and insane those proud wounded heroes of suvla and as our ship pulled into circular quay i looked at the place where me legs used to be and thanked christ there was nobody waiting for me to grieve and to mourn and to pity and the band played waltzing matilda as they carried us down the gangway but nobody cheered they just stood and stared and they turned their faces away and now every april i sit on my porch and i watch the parade pass before me i see my old comrades how proudly they march reliving their dreams of past glory i see the old men all twisted and torn the forgotten heroes of a forgotten war and the young people ask me what are they marching for and i ask myself the same question and the band plays waltzing matilda and the old men still answer the call but year after year their numbers get fewer someday no one will march there at all waltzing matilda waltzing matilda who ll go a waltzing matilda with
