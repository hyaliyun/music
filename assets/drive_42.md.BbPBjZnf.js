making it beat when she swept you off your feet and made it complete you know the plan you had to conquer the world thinking you scarface looking for that perfect girl and now you found her started with romantic then got to frantic then things thats normally small become gigantic now y all sinkin like the titanic here come the panic being with you like a habit without you i can t stand it it s tragic when you wonder when you lost that magic without understanding that you never had it try to grab it in the bed gettin a nut off communication cut off getting mad cause you turned or wondering where she shut off constantly comparing you to someone in my past we don t smile anymore and we argue over cash advance to that physical shit see what happens if you keep talkin see what happens if you lay a finger on me motherf yo see what i m sayin it s like one big mind game that everybody playin and niggas say bitches is trife bitches say niggas is we just don t understand our fundamental

touch with that part or not say word words are weapons for the revolutionary used for evil make the situation very scary word up but love is brave it flies in the face of fear yo wherever you want to go love ll take you there let s go you know a flower that grow in the ghetto know more about survival than the one from fresh meadows it got love for the sun that s where i m comin from spit in this fashion cause i love rockin over drums word i put my love into my music if you with me then you love how i do it if my heart you re livin in your ocean i m swimmin in never drowning got me floatin watching you in slow motion love potion overdosin approachin the explosion of my senses everyday without your heart is like a sentence in jail trust i ll always be mentally free you got the key to let it out i ll show you how it could be love it ain t nuttin but a word a chicken ain t nuttin but a bird yo yo yo  l amour n a pas de frontiere restes car je t aime comme tu es j ai traverse l ocean du

above them other duns try to spit game but i dont sweat it though know in my heart that we connected so i let it go now if they call you out your name and that s a different thing anything but queen i ll go to war like a king your friends sweat you cause you ain t got a band but they dont understand some things is meant to stay between a woman and man and they ain t privy to it so they try to get into it both you and me see through it so the way we flow is fluid we speak the love language they speak from pain and anguish some don t love theyselves so they perception is tainted out they joint like shit he payin for your rent missin the point when you rub me into your skin just like an ointment it s more than pillow talk it can t be translated learn how to speak it and become emancipated it

were the ones like nothing ever changes it s the only thing i know that nothing ever changes i m looking down this road and nothing ever changes no no nothing ever changes look at your dreams and your intention selfish it is for you to mention turning your thousands into millions marry a model and you have some children well they ve got their dreams too i imagine like water that won t come back to kill them sleeping at night without a murder in some little town you ve never heard of now look at your nightmares and all of your worst fears your car and your house and your girl and it stops there all these things you can t imagine losing like oh no what if that happened to me well what you ve got they ll never have to be like you to have your chance to be like you before they re gone  nothing ever changes at least that s how we act like nothing ever changes like god has got our backs like nothing ever changes i m looking down this road and i can see this pain yes it s only gonna grow maybe we need more shoes on our feet maybe we need more clothes and tv s maybe we need more cash and jewelry or maybe we don t know what we need maybe we need to want to fix it maybe stop talking maybe start listening maybe we need to look at this world less like a square and more like a circle maybe just maybe god s not unfair maybe we re all his kids and he s up there maybe he loves us for all our races maybe he hates us when were all so racist maybe he sees us when we don t care and it s heaven right here but it s hell over there and maybe the meek will inherit this earth cause it was written before so everything changes and nothing stays the same no everything changes and if you feel ashamed maybe you should change this before it gets too late maybe you should change this my brother we re standing at the gate everything changes changes changes maybe you should change it change it change it everything changes changes changes everything changes3","artist_name":"SOJA"},{"lyrics":"exploration of space exploration of space exploration of space exploration of space exploration of space","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"looking out my plane

casting director said fuck physicality give me som reality give me kids that can t act and are ugly they ll teach the world about beauty lady i can relate to this because before i met you i used to want to lock myself into a vault just to feel precious but now with every kiss hello and goodbye i feel a self worth no banker can tally and my heart is a protest that i let rally against my ribs cause i want to build my bones into cribs and lay my reluctance to rest test what it would be like to live phonetically to hold you unapologetically to plant a giving tree on my front lawn so that when you re gone it can give you back to me and i m sorry that when you sleep next to me that you re forced to listen to the symphony of the unplugged nostril and i m sorry that one time for some

it takes to take the time to get to know you we ve managed to muddle through the awkward stage of i like you and do you like me but when we both said yes life became a multiple choice test not knowing anything we became each other s best guess and holding your hand is less like exploration and more like discovery lady i don t have to study you to be sure you re the choice i made before i knew what the other choices were  it was made easy from the sham that we saw full of pretense and low grade suggestions i want you sweetly a world full of hopes with a brightness of all our convictions and like the best idea i ll ever have i want you to occur to me daily and i m sorry but i want to kiss you every time you have something incredible to say but you re beautiful beautiful in a you kind of way you re like the long lost vinyl of louis armstrong and i want to play you until it until it until it i want to pl pl play you until it until it ski until it ski i want to play you until it skips i want to tell you a secret and i want you to listen with your lips i want my hands on your hips like they were their final resting place and then put that funeral onto paper so you can trace their life

romance the world has ever seen let s face it we ve been making out to songs about break up and heart ache but i ve come to realize that romance should be less like a flower and more like an

the face of tragedy cause i m tired of living in a world that says people only come together when faced with catastrophe i want you to want me to be the me that you see when i m free to be the me that got you next to me and as for romance well i want that too i want to fall asleep next to you one hundred times a night so i can know you one hundred times better before we hit the day light and in spite of all of this i also want amnesia so that i can relive each kiss with a perfect newness that leaves me smashed in the arms of rapture i want the sky to fracture under the impossible weight of an apology cause i m sorry i m sorry that i want so much i m sorry that i ve been using i m sorry as a crutch to lean on for so long but if you sing me that song of sweet logic again then i promise to make the effort to stand on my own there s a reason that our hearts are more like a muscle and less like a bone i ve known so many people who ve grown up flexing it in front of a mirror as if falling for their own reflection would be adequate and that s bullshit because we only get from now until the time we go and if they ve only got time to love themselves then no one s going to be around to heard the sound of their heartbeat echo so lady don t expect an apology when i tell you i m only held together by a heart that pumps glue it s the strongest muscle in my body and i m flexing it for you i am still sleeping as we walk through the city our hands turning red and breath leaves a mark on the sky that is too bright from all the sky scrapers and i hold you back from the speeding cars going no where for nothing for no one","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"follow me just trust me it s gonna be a good thing for us i know that you re worried there is nothing to fear let me lead believe me

the crown and shit and come back home and this shit is retarded in itself i appreciate y all thank you man but it s one thing for me to come out here tonight and just perform the whole album for y all that s already amazing thank y all for letting me do that shit you know what i mean that s already crazy niggas don t do that type of shit perform they whole albums but it s one thing to just come and do the songs that s cool i love doing that i do that every day of my life but me personally i like to use the shows as an opportunity that i don t ever really get like that but i love to do it and that s the opportunity to come here and speak directly to y all and have y all feel every word that i m fuckin saying to you that s what i like to do so right now i want to talk to y all about this song right here that i just did the name of that song is called st tropez right that s the name of that song st tropez but if i m being honest with y all if i m keeping it funky if i m being real if i m keeping it a hunnid or if i m keeping it fo hunnid how my nigga yg fo hunnid be fuckin saying he love yg look at him aight if i m being real then the truth is nigga i don t even know where the fuck st tropez is at i don t know it s at i don t give a fuck when i talk about st tropez in the song what i do know about st tropez is it seems like the type of place that really rich people go to when they got a lot of fuckin money and they wanna vacation and be on a yacht with champagne glasses and bikinis it seem like that type of place but when i talk about it on this song it s just a metaphor what this song is about and y all gon feel me y all gon feel me cause i m home and y all gon feel me what this song is about and a lot of people don t understand this cause i be doing shows in new york los angeles you know fuckin chicago big ass cities so they don t feel me they don t know what it s like to be somebody that s from a small town a place like fayetteville you know what i mean they don t know what it s like they can t really relate to that shit so what i m trying to explain to them is when i m talking about st tropez on this song it s just a metaphor we grow up our whole our whole lives watching tv looking at the movies seeing places like what like paris london england st tropez new york city chicago l a right and as a kid from fayetteville what do we tell ourselves man one day i ma go there one day i ma go there right what ends up happening a lot of times because we come from a small town what happens we suffer from what we call a small town mentality now what does that mean that means we grow up our whole lives seeing these places and we tell ourselves we gon go but as we grow up we get way too comfortable in our comfort zone right and we too afraid to leave right that s why so many people ain t really stepping out the city like that they too afraid to go right so what i m talking about on this song is tryna give y all insight to the mentality that i had to overcome if you know anything about my story you know when i turned 18 i said fuck this shit i moved all the way to new york city i ain t know nobody in fucking new york but i left i left the ville and i went to new york i took a leap of faith fast forward the rest is history right now listen i want to take a break from all this album shit and i want to perform a song that only only those people

bulletproof religion always rip you like a wool off of the loom you floated farther than you ever meant to go and only now see you are naked when the wind began to blow there s no advice that you ve been missin no trespass unforgiven just a river with no pity for your boat i ve come to know that i was stealin all your kisses on the evenin the dogs were loose and lyin on the street you ve learned to blend into the choir how to hold your hand in fire and what to say instead of what you mean but the trouble it saves for just how hard it can be you met the women gluin jewels onto a crown you know men hidin in the city and their way of bein found and you got nothin on your shoulders still there s nothin too much colder than a rubble of a house that s fallin down like a baby cryin til it falls asleep the autumn s over by the time you count the color of the leaves you re paintin buzzards on the ceilin fallin faithless at the healin with your friends around you wailin on their knees  and i ve come to know that i was stealin all your kisses on the evenin the fog had swallowed everything but us you ve learned to balance on the cable drink us all under the table and who to try instead of who you trust with a hand on your heart that threw you under the bus so miss bottom of the hill what do you want the sun is shinin and you cleaned your pretty pistol of a heart but when you talk about tomorrow when to beg and when to borrow is how to hit the ground before you hear the shot and like a fish too deep and driftin in the sea you ve grown accustomed to the blindness lookin up and anxiously but there s a stone inside your pocket while you re plowin through the market but you know even the time it takes ain t free i ve come to know that i was stealin all your kisses on the evenin the stars were barely hangin in the sky you ve learned to eat when you re not hungry how to laugh when nothin s funny and what to get instead of gettin by but oh how it changes with the passin of time you heard so many voices hidden in the wind see all the children of the world and how its fingers reach for them two branches tired of their bendin i don t see our story endin quite as clean as it was easy to begin like a hole that let the fox under the fence you ve got no solace and no sanctuary you can recommend beggin for mercy at the bedside we got frozen in the headlights but our kind of mercy never made much sense i ve come to know that i was stealin all your kisses on the evenin but both were disappearin in the waves you ve learned to lead the one you follow how to spit out what you swallow and when to hand instead of give away that secret of ours is one i ll take to the grave so miss bottom of the hill what do you want the sun is shinin and i think you want me more often than not but like your father in the garden i won t finish what i started til you bill me for the flowers i forgot and like a curse too old for anyone to care you said to meet you on the mountain cause you never make it there and sucked your thumb along the highway proudly promisin that one day i d miss the way we tumbled down the stairs and i ve come to know that i was stealin all your kisses on the evenin the car was gently glidin off the road you ve learned to rise above your body how to never say you re sorry and where to go instead of going home with the light by the bed and all the clothes you ve outgrown","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"further on down the road baby you will accompany me further on down the road baby you will accompany me when i think back your love

was promised a lot when a stranger lay beside me i was wrong i was right you were poised in the light both as evil as ever and holy i was bitten and chewed bound and gagged on the truth when that stranger lay beside me i was soft i was hard the sky heavy with stars never meant to surrender their meaning i was love i was hate stuffed and licking my plate when a stranger lay beside me i was chided and cheered we were reeking with fear that the world might return for it s mercy i was mended and torn i was killed and reborn when a stranger lay beside me and the moon rose again and the snake shed it s skin and the back of the city was breaking we both took to it well blind and feeling ourselves but we needed the love we were making i was captured and free the sun set through the
