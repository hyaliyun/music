yesterday but too many storms have come and gone leaving a trace of not one god given ray is it because my life is ten shades of gray i pray all ten fade away seldom praise him for the sunny days and like his promise is true only my faith can undo the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew clear blue and unconditional skies have dried the tears from my eyes no more lonely cries my only bleeding hope is for the folk who can t cope with such an endurin pain that it keeps em in the pourin rain who s to blame for tooting caine into your own vein what a shame you shoot and aim for someone else s brain you claim the insane and name this day in time for falling prey to crime i say the system s got you victim to your own mind dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to i know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all but i think you re moving too fast don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to i know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all but i think you re movin too fast don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to i know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all but i think you re moving too

died and there i stood alone and afraid i dropped to my knees and there i prayed and i promised him everything i could give if only he would make the music live and he promised it would live once more

the greek and he s busting moves and my legs were hurting and my feet were too i called him after said i ll skip the backstage hi bye but thanks for the nice music and all the exercise and we laughed and it was alright and we laughed and it was alright and it was alright there s a thin line between a middle aged guy with a backstage pass and a guy with a gut hanging around like a jackass everybody there was twenty years younger at least i ll leave with this not my fondest memory i carried my legs back down the hill gave my backstage passes to two cute asian girls i drove to my place near tahoe got in my hot tub and i thought well that s how it goes and it was quiet and i was listening to the crickets and ben s still out there selling lots of tickets and though i m contented there s a tinge of competitiveness but ben s my friend and i know he gets it then in a couple of days my meltdown passed back to the studio doing twelve hour shifts singing a song about one thing or another another

drone little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his cheek and he smoked it and circled his head like a reef he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of my self a wink of his eye and twist of his head soon gave me the note i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like uh the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim as he drove off to the

of string to let out i hope you re smiling like god is pulling at the corners of your mouth cause i might be naked and lonely shaking branches for bones but i m still time zones away from who i was

wait so i ended up flying her out for the five last dates it was better than before never would have thought i d be with a random girl that i met with on the job couldn t tell if i was falling for her or tripping because of her shit i got comfortable on them comforters we were basically dating for the week she flew back home i flew back home i made it in one piece but she was falling apart texting me every moment telling me she s sick of home i was just homesick cause when i got home i felt like i was kind of over it i stopped hitting her up she started noticing i was new to it didn t realize how deep i was in till she sent me snapchats of cuts deep in her skin some suicidal shit telling me that i m supposed to be with you so if we re not together there is no reason why i should live now i

digest what he said to me he literally already had people calling who said they want to invest in me damn thought i was in a dream first time homies with somebody in the industry thought i was bout to blow up i was overwhelmed thinking to myself is it really supposed to go this well so before i made a move i told him before i agree to anything prove to me what you can do he set up a video shoot it was a nightmare he put money behind it but didn t care about my ideas arguing over the creative direction i said fuck it i ain t doing this i scrapped the whole session then i made the song exception thinking i know this one is powerful he s gotta love it i gotta send it he said he liked it but he wants to edit so he got a new beat corny hook and turned it to a pop record this dude s tripping acting like a baller but now i know that he s not cause he s treating me like a dollar just another check off his checklist check to deposit now demanding twenty percent for the work he put on this he ain t did shit subliminally hinting to me he gon blackball me if he don t get shit he know everybody in the game they re gonna believe him more too i want to tell him suck a dick but i can t afford to

feels like to go from completely avoided to somebody that everybody is talking about it don t even feel the same when i walk in my house new rumors bout me every single day like he don t want to chill with us he rather chill with sway he think he better than us he think he moving on i go out pretend to be social just to prove them wrong but i ain t see my dad in a month i only see him for dinner we re still acting like that s good enough but i ve been blowing him off like i m busy and stuff to the point it don t feel the same when he s picking me up you know when you re comfortable enough with someone that you could be in complete silence and it wouldn t be awkward well it s awkward between us i m bothered so i ask stupid questions just to keep him talking like how is your job how is your mom how did i get here from writing these songs i go to my homies houses and i m jealous of them cause they see their dad as a dad i see my dad as an old friend i bet he afraid to bring it up cause he

all the things that he witnessed and on the second uh on the second verse i m rapping from the perspective of my brother someone who was in the streets and running around and you know maybe doing things that he shouldn t have done at the time so for me it was like showing you what can come from the same household you can go left or you can go right i think a lot of people go that traditional route when you re raised around um these things that can touch you in a negative way i think for me i just saw it as a very positive and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members unfortunately uh so this is basically just the story of possibility uh of what can come and what can happen and my rendition if you will of stop the violence you know it s also sort of an homage to krs one as well that s why i threw his vocals in there um but yeah i just wanted people to know what happens where i come from in maryland as beautiful as a place it is its also a dark

goes to she says the light that s there won t go nowhere no way she don t spend every second smiling but she s learning something exciting every day she d rather be 75 and sunny than 29 with a chance

worshipped by a few but ignored on the whole meet the feebles is a film cult classic it s basically unknown but some say it s fantastic most women that i meet seem totally unfazed til sometimes there somebody who seems totally amazed i might not be in magazines as a heart throb face but in a few devoted hearts i ve found a strong fan base i m a cult boyfriend not a mainstream show i m lonely or i m worshiped by a lady in the know when you re a cult boyfriend life is always intense they love me or they hate me no one s on the fence cerebus is cult comic book series it s got fans but it s never found in movies or in theories wfmu is a cult radio station always tuned to by a few devoted fans around the nation for every time i couldn t get a second date or even first why does one think i m the best when all the rest think i m the worst all of those times no one at all wanted to know if i m really all that awesome wouldn t more people think so i guess cult boyfriend is the term for me it s always been quality not quantity a cult boyfriend s like a record in a bargain bin no one knows what it s worth til a collector comes in hm who are some cult literary figures i can honor maybe j g ballard or flannery o connor haggis and fugu that s like food for cult eaters jim jones charles manson father yod they re cult leaders anyways the point being do i have to be magical can t we date a few months and then move on normal and casual suicidally alone and then totally smothered it s so much pressure when you go from one extreme to the other i guess cult boyfriend is the term for me it s always been quality not quantity a cult boyfriend s like a record in a bargain bin no one knows what it s worth til a collector comes in i m a cult boyfriend not a mainstream show i m lonely or i m

like piss heads eating chicken kebabs or death wishing junkies sniffing up scag open up like a fist in a vag i was missing in action now i m back to fill in the facts ripping up tracks like timesheets when your supervisor finds you skiving lighting a pipe when you re required for driving high as a kite like a microlite on the skyline your pride is denied of a fight and like it was time and i ve had a skinful cos even with my plan bladder well full i m still rapping skilful attack on impulse like cats to little rats and squirrels i leave you twats as cripples like your backs were brittle and hammers hit you it now stands official local town councillors fear this anarchist s rule they know my mayhem is taking it s toll i m not restrained by the planet s gravitational

around if they ain t see the vision i bet they feel it now see the difference with me is i ain t afraid of believin friends only come around when they know it s convenient but my circle gettin smaller by the second funny how my biggest fear was not bein accepted but look i gave my heart to a person who couldn t love herself i m lost in somebody lookin for someone else put my trust in a person who ain t believe in me eventually it just made it harder for me to trust myself i leave the past in the past no looking back now but i ain t complacent with where i m at now so in hopes that somebody else could relate to me i take another sip of this henney and write these raps down anxiety killin me i ve been losin touch losin my patience i don t know who to trust plus me and my family ain t as close now i take a sip of this henney until i loosen up i just need someone as down for me someone to just tell me they proud of me somebody who s really around for me if ever they see me sink in they swim in and they drown for me the ones hittin my line used to duck me when i called keep it real with me or don t fuck with me at all i ve been dodgin the fakes the politics and the snakes your pride is big as your ego see i just couldn t relate for real see the difference is how we re raised and where we came and the bullet that landed three inches from my brain and the fact that my soul is different than yours no matter how many times they compare us man we are not the same look prayin for peace in this world that we live in same time i just pray i m forgiven they say i m weak cause i put it all in the open had to swallow my pride and bottle up my emotions look  i left the past in the past no looking back now but i ain t complacent with where i m at now so in hopes that somebody

every couple of months his mom leaves him for no good reason his step dad beats him not too many friends only ever had a few of them but recently they don t want anything to do with him always eating lunch in the bathroom stall he just wants to feel normal and be cool again yeah always feeling like the outcast he s been going crazy ever since his dad passed he needs guidance and advice but instead he only has breakdowns and flashbacks of the car crash uh it s been getting harder everyday if he was still around everything would be okay cause his dad was always the light at the end of the tunnel but now that same damn tunnel is looking dark and grey he keeps quiet in the back of the class and when the bell rings steven hurries home fast scared to death the other kids will kick his ass on the long walk home cause its happened in the past so he s getting used to the black eyes and fat lips but all he s got is a fake smile and cut wrists wishin he could walk right up to them and show them the scars and say look you re the reason that i ve done this maybe they would finally understand and go back to how it was before it all began but he s just a little different so they taunt him and they beat him yeah it s all just fun and games they don t give a damn yeah his older brother ain t around in and out of jail hanging with the wrong crowd he s been doing coke smoking weed getting drunk all his life he s a shame no he s not too proud now his habits are rubbing off on his little bro yeah but guess what little did he know that everytime he did a line everytime he lit a joint everytime he took a shot he would set the mode so steven s sitting in his room getting high now doors locked music up with his lights out he just takes another toke til his room fills with smoke 5 6 7 hours til he knocks out now he started stealing pills from his mom 8 9 10 at a time and now they re gone and maybe for a moment all his problems seem to fade but the high fades too after not too long and that s when it really sinks in and that s when it hits him that these god damn drugs won t fix him curled up on the floor can t take it anymore now he s talking to god cuz he s the only one that gets him on his knees looking up can t stop crying god i know we haven t talked in a long time but this time i really need you please god help me say something just give me a sign because now i m falling apart and i don t think that i can do it please god give me the strength to pull through it tell me should i give up i could end it all right now i just don t know if i m brave enough to do it cuz there s gotta be a better way than suicide try to wait it out give it time you ll be fine but it s been so long and i still haven t been able to get rid of all the thoughts that i feel inside so sick so angry so mad and to top it off no one even knows that that s when he stood up wiped his tears walked over to his desk and got a pen and a notepad he just couldn t see it getting any better so on a cold dark night in december steven knew exactly what he had to do but first he sat down and wrote a couple letters one to his step dad one to his mother couple to the kids at school one to his brother bringing them the pain that they once brought him tear drops on the paper one after another yeah i hope that you all feel guilty cuz i m broken now and you can t heal me and now you re all an accomplice in murder each and every one of you have chipped in to kill me so the reason that i m writing you this evening is to say goodbye and to tell you that i m leaving but don t hold your breath cuz i ain t never coming back sincerely yours steven23","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"today i feel like running naked through your street to get your attention whoa oh oh i broke up with my girl so

all my dreams but i don t know where it s gon take me tired of being broke gotta start acting shady making dirty money yo this shit is so degrading mamma know i m sorry for this route in which i m taking i ain t fuckin proud of these decisions that i m making but i m desperate for some answers why my heart is always aching if you hear me lord talk to me all the sins from my past have been haunting me i m so scared of the future so i stay stuck broken into pieces yo my spirits all taped up i came up but it feels like i m coming down pool full of liquor swim til i fuckin drown that s the

about to cave i m so trapped in my mind like a fuckin slave so much weight on my chest got me feeling tired plague in my soul swear it s like a wildfire like a wildfire spreading everywhere take a look into my eyes see the pain oh there s plenty there see the pain yo there s plenty there i don t know if they really care where is love is it anywhere and if it is yo it s really rare can a broken heart be repaired can a broken heart be repaired can you tell me all i need to know or is it lost in our own despair can you tell me all i need to know can you tell me all i need to know or is it lost
