survived death s a release but a much bigger beast is a living on limited time like how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they re dying how do you feel bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone not because you didn t love em but just because you felt too weak to be strong you couldn t bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak the cruelty of randomness holding for ransom their life and their fate and their dreams you see that they re fighting and know that they re losing but still you make jokes and you laugh cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last now every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it s in the past and when they are gone you just try to move on cause the memory s hurting too bad grown up so much and i wonder who you d ve become if you stuck for a while just know that i love you good friend ain t forget you and when i remember i smile and i guess i d say i ll see you soon but the truth is that i see you now still talk to you like you re around and i guess i say you left too soon but the truth is that you never left cause i never let myself forget an eye for an eye and a tooth for the tooth will leave us all mumbling and blind so we stumble blind through depths of the dark looking for something divine life is a journey to live is to suffer and i have been suffering through mine but living s a blessing so i ain t no stressing cause some of my niggas ain t round and he got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin i searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind i tell her that it ll be fine but deep down i know that i m lying the family came took rings and his chains the bank took the house and the rides the only thing left was his child and she had his smile and his eyes so much to the soul when the grandmama kept her she d look at her sometime and cry the very next day she cried and day after day she cried then called baby mama and told her i m sorry can t keep her no more i have tried no killer was captured but i know he listening so i d like to tell you in song the streets was a jungle i pray that you made it i hope that you righted your wrongs i hope that you learn i hope that you changed so your mama won t know this pain so my homie s name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain  and i guess i d say i ll see you soon but the truth is that i see you now still talk to you like you re around aye and i

mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads and mamma in her kerchief and i in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winter s nap when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter away to the window i flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the lustre of mid day to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick i knew in a moment it must be st nick more rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen to the top of the porch to the top of the wall now dash away dash away dash away all as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky so up to the house top the coursers they flew with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof as i drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight happy christmas to all and to all a good night","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"jingle bells

for word he always told it the same it was his favorite christmas story called the girl with no name he said i met her up in delaware in 1937 she was wearing red lipstick to match her pretty dress december 24 at a quarter till 11 00 s when i finally gained the courage to ask her to dance  20 years later as he took his last breath saw a cold christmas morning in a hospital bed the children had grown he had nobody left except the little old nurse who was holding his hand he said ma am could you share a little holiday cheer a simple christmas story s all he wanted to hear but his eyes filled with tears at the words she spoke because his favorite christmas story was the one that she told she said i met him up in delaware in 1937 though i never caught his name he was a traveling man december 24 at a quarter till 11 00 i m so glad he got the courage to ask me to dance","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there are two wondrous weeks for our winter vacation before new year s and school

cash points and cannabis you cocaine snort if you think i got caught i m kicking like a stallion i lived in a yard where my mummy tried hard for all the things that i wanted but my money was inadequate pro bly be killed by my cousins back in africa if they knew i risked my free water hot food and resources every day to dress nicer on a camera i don t need your input fuck you and your

up in your safe spot and leave the place taped off it s deeper than a namedrop real problems don t need discussions i fear god and not repercussions look i m only angry at the choices that i didn t make i don t regret what i did but what i didn t say and for this money i m on a different wave it s why i ain t written in this will when i say i m on his estate it comes arms well i ve got an entourage like vinny chase this ain t chiraq we don t need a 38 just two young g s one nike pouch and this little blade and if you live that day give thanks to your god cause there isn t one prayer mummy didn t say still wonder what my dad would say and it s fucked cause i just wanted us to bond like sean connery daniel craig no first steps nah my daddy couldn t see me cry i m still searching for the reason why i was six months old at a bus stop my mum no home struggling to ketamine like a legal high when so volatile look over the reasons why people die man this beef never sleeps or slides man are dying over minor violations s why i keep the beef and the bread separate like tgi s they touch us we pay em back like it s ppi fuck it let s ride get animated like cgi dead being a hype man can t find my man and then i ll settle for his right hand you can t buy heart remember hawk eye you think these undercover cars could get us or that i can t spot the bacon in the passing vectras don t you find it funny that i study law and still recruit young fraud stars like i m harvey specter hot headed i swear that i had a dream though a young fire before i had spoken with avelino and nowadays music s got my schedule looking hectic i ain t got a timeline i m travolta with tarantino look i ain t slacking it s money over passion i mean passion over money hate this money with a passion money s just a paper i got value in my assets i got value in my mental it s me fraser 169 on instrumental i swear that i ll make it rapping even if it kills me i swear that i ll make it happen on my digital piano until my hands bled literally i was smashing keys till my fingers grew callus how could i fear rappers i feel words hear colours defeat challenge give thanks to my synaesthesia i ain t a rapper i m a fucking genius so when i see you don t panic remember what you said on the roads there s no lacking i don t wanna see you draw for your boot there s no time i ll jump out the passenger side like there s no traffic catch you with your girl or your mum you d do the same so we ll take you to an inch of your life for all your chatting shut your fucking mouth and make p s i used to let disrespect slide to make peace now it s like i m stuck in two minds to my reaction cause my pride and my ego turned giant like james dean i m a mess right and if that catty doesn t fuck me the third time with no strings attached like a test drive i m telling her i m cutting in the next five all communication breaking down like an enzyme my second s the most precious commodity i invest time i was late every day straight for three years guess that s two ways that i could never make a deadline i was out in powerleague norbury with camo in the rain hail sleet with my football in a deadline scraping by on pennies tryna link a jezzy on my 8520 and i couldn t link one squares was a game had me all stressed got finessed by my main and he didn t get touched it had me sitting there pissed thinking bout my people all the times that we missed like have you ever lost love have you ever had a guy that would die so you live in a cage kept away from your brother and your mum in my world you re unsure to the people you can trust when you lose the only person that was there from the jump i m as humble as they come and i ain t changed from the knife in the cypher to the shotgun shells in the party with a pump ask edem ask paddy with squares i had strikers but i m more like ibra over vardy when it s beef because i hardly ever run i ve got pride i ve seen man running for their life get caught now they re covering their heart and their lungs with their arms on his ones cause his right hand panicked and i don t even blame him seen a man scream while he bleeds on the pavement guts in his hands civilians with tissue putting pressure where the pain is the panic as you fade in blocking out sounds how your body shuts down when your organs start failing knife crime dangerous next day famous give it six years they won t remember what your name is everything changes when your case isn t relevant and all the guys who claimed they would ride in your name looking lost them boys don t have half the heart to settle it i ve seen a whole class end up dead or in jail ask scales about times he was chilling with my brother in a chicken shop opposite the entrance to tenison s everybody s dying but nobody s rising up a remington we ve got shanks and false hope everybody s selling it you ain t getting rich quick tryna sell big bits too lazy to work so you want to own a business or a clothing line no vision you can t cut corners in a line of life karma s like the tightest vice i m running on my own cctv s in your hands bro they ve got it in your phone if they catch me going home looking for another young rapper to expose i m pro bly cutting from the scene cause with all the evidence they gain i m getting more than just assault i ain t living for the gram man are snitching on the cam if i hit him then i m dumb but if he dips me he s the man i can t win there s no way i m handling that if i run then i m a neek but if i don t then i m a fool so on road i m looking happy but i m screaming in my head having panic attacks they got me anxious i m two wrong responses from a shanking at any given time i been there and done that on many different nights it s pro bly the reason that i got many different rhymes i m really living life15","artist_name":"Dave"},{"lyrics":"she wants a man from brum she wants a man from brum she wants a man from brum argh it s mad she wants a man from brum

haunt my mind and i can t stop our world from dying baby goodbye dear summer i m so tired i haven t slept right in months now these living conditions are miserable and baby all i ever wanna do is kiss you all i ever wanna do is come home baby these other inmates are driving me crazy it s so loud and when i close my eyes to sleep all i hear is the sound of the screams of these people and some of them are so f king crazy that i don t really know how they operate daily i don t know if i can call this an existence something s lurking in my mind i hear whispers i m in hell when i m awake and when i go to sleep i feel demons in my cell and even when i dream there s an evil i can tell that there s something on the fringes the tips of these syringes and when i think about what you must have gone through i pray to god that he keeps you and loves you coz i can t do either of those from where i am baby it s like i m dead and i m a ghost to think that you had to bury your dad i couldn t be there to hold your hand i loved him too baby i know he s proud watching you now yeah looking down little lady remember when they let me go to the hospital and you told me later you were there behind the glass i swear that i could feel you but they wouldn t let me ask if i could hold you for a second and he was dying in my arms i never told you your daddy looked at me and smiled i never forget that moment but now it s like i m losing you another way i feel it rolling off your tongue but i refuse to let you say  dear summer i haven t heard from you in a while now is everything o k i got the email you sent a couple months ago i m glad the music s going well i m glad you re on your way i m glad you found your rhythm and you re back up on your feet you never were the type to be accepting of defeat i sleep a little easier now you re doing fine it puts my soul to rest takes a little off my mind don t worry about me baby i m o k i think back to that day when i walked into the bank and didn t know that i was there and the gun was in my hand i didn t know how it appeared the lady started screaming so i started screaming too i woke up two days later with 6 thousand in my shoe and how i got the money i don t really have a clue i thought you left it for me like something you would do i drove myself to rehab and checked myself in there for the first time in a month that i was seeing crystal clear remember how many clinics told me i wasn t eligible too broke live too far away those f king crooks and that judge handed down 10 years like what like he was giving away detention and you were in the court with your papers and your suit trying to plead the case baby like it was everything you know every fibre of your being it was you who pulled me through even though we lost the case i saw what you would do i saw you give your blood work your knuckles to the bone trying to bring me back but i ain t never coming home i m gone and if i come i m coming back a different man you don t want this baby and now i understand i love you til the day i f king die but now baby it s time to say goodbye dear summer i got your letters i agree with everything you said i ll sign the papers baby you are free and know that what you do it s all ok by me and even though thinking about you with another man makes me go wanna insane like i can t even f king stand makes me wanna grab my hair and pull it out my head then rip open these bars and fly to you again it s my fault that i m here it s not on you so go ahead baby shine like you do show this planet what it means to a star you supported me in here so i ll support you where you are but please don t come and see me coz it shatters up my soul when you come and i can t touch you then i have to let you go i did it in the past but i can t do it anymore it cuts me up inside and it shakes me to the core when you come it s like i m me again and that s a dangerous thing coz i can t be me in here i got shed my humanity i gotta become a part of the system so i can live in the system so i don t die in the system baby i m tired ain t got no more resistance there ain t no god in here that wants to listen so part of me is dead and i ve acknowledged that he s missing so talk to god for me tell him lord i say forgive me i try to do myself but i don t think he ever hears me he s muted out by the screams of all these people a layer of sickness and of darkness and of evil and even though the devil is breathing in my ear and he wants to keep me cloaked in the servitude of fear i fear no evil there s none of that inside i feel the goodness in me so to him i say goodbye goodbye goodbye 1","artist_name":"Antix"},{"lyrics":"so many people right now motivated to do some bullshit over some bullshit ass reasons but we bout

re the one that can do what s never been done that can win what s never been won meantime life outside goes on all around you you lose yourself you reappear you suddenly find you got nothing to fear

free do what they do just to be nothing more than something they invest in while some on principles baptized to strict party platform ties social clubs in drag disguise outsiders they can freely criticize tell nothing except who to idolize and say god bless him while one who sings with his tongue on fire gargles in the rat race choir bent out of shape from society s pliers cares not to come up any higher but rather get you down in the hole that he s in but i mean no harm nor put fault on anyone that lives in a vault but it s alright ma if i can t please him old lady judges watch people

until my hands finally fell and i fought my daytime self with a mighty dose of hey look at the night time me and i never do win that battle but i fight it over and over and over and over it seems and i saw an old man smiling on a park bench feeding the pigeons and my head was spinning as my young body ached i wished for an old man s vision and i watched the way he moved slow serene and lucky to be alive thought to myself i m never gonna make it that far with too many nights like last night and i d rather be 75 and sunny than acting like i was 17 and freezing again i d rather be up early in the morning than up late at night again erasing memories of where i ve been or to be through at 52 someday stone faced and bleary eyed you better believe i m living for the moment but my moment s growing bigger by and by and i ve got a best friend she don t drink or smoke like i ve been known to she s got religion she s a one woman dynamo and lights up every room she goes to she says the light that s there won t go nowhere no way she don t spend every second smiling but she s learning something exciting every day she d rather be 75 and sunny than 29 with a chance of showers all the time she d rather be old as dirt than new as any nine dollar bottle of wine or to be thawed at 35 mama stoned with her back to the wind you better believe she is living for the moment but her moment is the whole damn thing and i see these spin kids double wide eyed and rolling and rolling and tumbling they re roaming in inches taken the high dive approach and screaming towards the water their hearts race a million miles as they buy another smile from a jar their bodies are screaming for the water and you know i just hope they can make it that far i hope they re 75 and sunny not 29 with a chance of flurries all the time i hope we re all old as dirt not new as any twenty five dollar ride that we try or to be thawed at 35 mama stoned with our backs to the wind you better believe i m living for moment but my moment son s the whole damn thing and i say i d rather be 75 oh how nice oh how easy for me to say i ve never broken a bone in my life let alone had my heart or a hip replaced and i keep this furious pace and i still feel so good and strong and i do get tempted for a taste just a taste to keep me going going going going going going going going gone but i ve i got a notion that everything i learned coming round and my devotion to the new thing and the next thing and the hip thing is slowing down and i ve got a light in here won t go nowhere no way and i don t spend every second smiling and i ain t trying but i m excited for every day cause i d rather be 75 and sunny than 29 with a chance of showers all the time i d rather be old and in the way than this year s new kid
