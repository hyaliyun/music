a rockafeller still be in the church of lalibela singing hymns a cappella whether posed in mirabella in couture or collecting residuals from off the score i m making sure i m with the 144 i ve been here before this ain t a battle this is war word to boonie i make salat like a sunni get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community had opportunity went from hoodshock to hood chic but it ain t what you cop it s about what you keep and even if there are leaks you can t capsize this ship cause i baptize my lips every time i take a sip you can get the money you can get the power but keep your

into the sea of faith only to find the treasure lost in the shipwreck inside of you there ain t no guarantees none of that nonsense like on tv just gotta roll the dice and take your lumps you re gonna get yourself knocked down so better learn to stand back up for those who dwell on disaster let sorrow be their master me i got 10 miles to go on a 9 mile road and it s a rocky rough road but i don t

weekends here far from my good timin friends things just went from bad to worse but i don t know when the only thing i know for sure is i ain t going back again they took me down to cellblock b after stripping off my clothes put me in a monkey suit and threw me in the throes like a rat in a maze a cow in the herd or a sparrow with a broken wing now i know the reason why the caged bird has to sing cause i m just a weekender in the davidson county jail and my old man he ain t got the cash to even go my bail should have listened to my mama and quit my life of sin before i went backsliding again this bed is hard and the room is cold my cellmate s got a cough she takes her meds and sleeps all day got six more weeks till she s off she said she beat her boyfriend up while high on crack cocaine now she sits and watches her life go down the drain cause she s just a weekender in the davidson county jail her old man ain t got the cash to even go her bail she should have listened to her mama and quit her life of sin before she went backsliding again walk into some other room they tried to make me eat red dyed gravy cardboard bread and something that looked like meat one tough girl from cellblock c picked a fight with the man at the desk mighty sue was sent back to her room and i bet you know the rest cause we re all just weekenders in the davidson county jail my old man ain t got the cash to even call my bail should have listened to the good lord maybe quit my life of sin before i went backsliding again before i went backsliding again","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"baby i love

center of town to a spot on a wooden table where her feet didn t reach the ground and when she kisses me it tasted like cinnamon and her skin smelled of cider and rose and when she looked at me we both got quiet my heart beat so hard we were in so close once in such a beautiful while that still makes me smile and she called me her ugly american and i would call her my canadian flower and i don t think that we ll ever get there again we had such power and she would call me her ugly american and i ll remember my canadian rose especially when the fall comes to burlington we were in so close i finally made it this town looks rearranged i don t know these people anymore but in the best ways not much else has changed from the way it was before and at least they still have that certain table where i once carved a particular name i run my fingers through the weathered carving and i almost can feel the same and my mouth it almost tastes just like cinnamon as i ponder what my pilgrimage means and i try to figure out where vancouver is from here and i listen to the leaves if only for a beautiful while that still makes me smile and she called me her ugly american and i would call her my canadian flower and i don t think that we ll ever get there again we had such power and she would call me her ugly american and i ll remember my canadian rose especially when the fall comes to burlington we were in so close and every single hope and dream i could ever conjure up passionately springs in me and all things are possible plausible and perfectly both of ours forever after and every day at least it seemed that way once in such a beautiful while that still makes me smile and she called me her ugly american and i would call her my canadian flower and i don t think that we ll

house music let s see okay let me try to think real quick i think i was at a house party probably checking out some vibe and saying oh man what s that and said oh this was some of that warehouse vibe i know i went down there to check it out and said oh this was cool but the main thing that i grasped was from just being there was the unification of the party how everybody seem like they were on one accord you know everybody was there you know like one unit you know and all embracing each other and the music you know music boxes so many other clubs and even over here in england whether it was just the shoom and ripped parties confusion parties so it goes back a long long way this house thing you know me and being there and evolved and you in the feeling my first experience and that s what we were getting at some of the most important deejays in that early stage was definitely frankie knuckles and ryan hardy and larry levan this was like the three inspirations for me coming up in the system you know i know there was many other deejays back in the day and all due respect to all of them but those were three that i actually had a close rapport with where you know i ve been to their house they ve been to my house and we ve been in touch with each other like from a brotherly perspective you know so that s what i probably focused on you know mentioning those three brothers often in the system because i had personal conversations with them where i ve seen them outside of their artiste kind of persona you know i ve seen them just ordinary you know they were relaxed umm it also had disco to me you know and some of the break type material definitely the earlier disco era the disco period where all the guys got inspired from a lot of that disco tracks that ryan hardy and frankie knuckles were playing in chicago that s where they generated the idea to go buy the sample units the drum machines the 303 707 909 a lot of the young cats bought because it was the simplified way for them to reduce rhythms and from a cheap format they couldn t afford to go to the studios and pay for the kind of productions they were hearing on those disco tracks but they could come up with little formulas you know that made them feel good it s always been about you know trying to create something to make you feel good in return you know hopefully it would make others feel good and you know you know so that s where a lot of the guys got inspired to you know push this whole house system forward yeah","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"pop it pop it pop it pop it pop it pop it pop it pop it pop it
