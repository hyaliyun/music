no thang but a chicken wang how birdy can a high beez speaking of beez did we beez in a trap fool disclosure most of you know that i stay on my culinary grind and a few months back i opened up my hybird stand in chelsea market w restaurateur steven starr long story short we closed hybird now that i ve cut to the chase bear w me while i chase my tale a lil more i m about nothing if i m not about ideas sculpting ideas smacking em flipping em rubbing em down or waving them in the air like i just don t care these are the things of my life a meme s a terrible thing to waste mine are like my children and i really really care about them i guess you can say i m passionate so much so i almost literally wear my heart on my sleeve i love music i love art i love literature theatre tv film and smart big hearted women over the last few years i ve fallen in love with ideas about food i can t exactly remember when it happened but at some point i realized that my lego shield had been struck by cupid when i began to hold ferran adria and jiro in the same high regard previously only reserved for say jay dilla i too dreamed of sushi or techno emotional cuisine in the same vein as dreaming of new breakbeats or organizing harmony so i dabble and ate and studied and ate and dreamed and ate becoming friends with some of the greatest chefs on the entire planet the top ones cook like the best jazzmen like gil or bill evans they re thoughtful nerdy sensitive types dreamers that waltz for the debs or pull deliciousness out of their cool so having come forward now it s time to stand down the stand is down my foodie partner and i have killed the lofty idealized hybird kinda weird to pull the plug considering the bird s critical swag cover of new york magazine mentions in the new york times bon appetit food wine elle the new yorker zagat paper magazine new york post village voice time out the hollywood reporter vogue and a cameo on the view where sherri shepherd and jenny mccarthy came to hybird to meet me for lunch but after a lifetime of balancing art and commerce i find myself once again at the fork knife and spoon in the road and unlike my other jobs this venture isn t survival based if anything its from the heart and it s not satisfying that heart it s not satisfying at all and so bye bye birdie chicken scratched the killing was kinda akin to throwing your pretty witty emo daughter under the bus well because she s a pretty witty emo chick who s become taken w dancing at the edge of a fiscal cliff thing is the gentle curves of daughter s arabesque looked far more graceful portending ruin then they looked selling out at the end of the day the poor sales were turning the corner but the girl was getting left behind so consider this to be part one of my grubby missive or would that be a dis missive i expect to be expecting follow ups as inquiring inquirers will certainly want to be knowing but in the meantime i ll preemptively leave you with some questo questions 1 hybird may have become a chicken without a head but could it have been a lame duck 2 the chicken or the egg 3 invocation or lost in translation 4 flown coup or avian flew 5 seasoned ending

the music stops what s next are we just writing songs or are we concerned with uniting a people to follow the great commission of christ back in the day i was a lunch line rapper after that i guess i was a punchline rapper then i got saved and sometime after ya boy came back as a frontline rapper and when i say the frontlines that s not a front line im out here preaching christ on the frontlines and no it ain t about rocking stages cause some of my engagements are out on the pavement i m out to take the bible create disciples who make disciples disciple cycles that s why i want the beats to knock so after the music stops you can meet the rock i pray that you would know him well this is like show and tell it s more than a show i m showing you emmanuel so yeah im hoping that you re liking the flow but it s only so you could know the god im writing it for let s go  after the show after the set after the music stops what s next will there be fellowship prayer disciples will you open your bibles after the music stops after its over after it ends after the music stops what then will you understand that christ is king or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops i recorded a couple songs some fast some slow so the listeners would know the importance of the show the importance of the show s not to excite these folks but make god s truth relevant ignite these folks discipleship is our call but we make disciples this is not a suggestion create disciples the teaching is a process it s not overnight and its not a stage and a mic nah it s life on life christ walked with twelve ate with twelve talked to twelve shaped the twelve invested in em well you could say that he made the twelve who made many more who made plenty more now it s on you and me if there s anymore one teach two teach three teach four teach five teach six teach seven teach more this is what we ve been commissioned it s the reason why i write so that you could hear the truth not so you can say im tight after the show after the set after the music stops what s next will there be fellowship prayer disciples will you open your bibles after the music stops after its over after it ends after the music stops what then will you understand that christ is king or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops so we write this for the right to speak on what s righteous and then we might check for a culture who likes the hypeness some say we keep it krunk some say we hype man we just wanna pump the resurrection of the christ man we in the burbs in the hoods that s hostile we share a common view like synoptic gospels and you know we keep a couple young dudes around us and teach em the same truths god used to ground us this is a lifestyle so when the mic s down i pray people follow christ when they turn the lights down i pray that everybody playing this song will be challenged by everything i had to say in this song i dont do this for the money i dont do this for fame i dont do this so the industry can know my name i do this in hopes to glorify yeshua the king if youre feeling me you know you should be doing the same after the show after the set after the music stops what s next will there be fellowship prayer disciples will you open your bibles after the music stops after its over after it ends after the music stops what then will you understand that

you re not aware of it occurring the track is one of the early tracks because i only did five tracks in south africa on the sessions that i did with forere who is the accordion player plays on boy in the bubble we did a few other tracks one of the tracks i said you know i like only the drums on this track i don t really want anything else i don t want the accordion or bass i just want the drums and the drums weresomething like a kind of a traveling rhythm in country music i m a big sun records fan early 50 s mid 50 s sun records you hear that drum beat a lot like a fast johnny cash type of rhythm and somewhere later in the week of recording when i had put together a rhythm section of ray phiri and bakithi kumalo and isaac mtshali as the rhythm section i said to ray one day i like this drum pattern take a listen to it and see if it does anything for you you know it sounds kind of like a country thing to me so he starts to play his version of american country ray he was in the key of e and then he was playing you know of course he s playing electric but he d be up over here you know like then the drums are going oh then he went which is a relative minor chord to that key i said hey that s interesting that you played a minor chord because all the music that i d been recording with in south africa with the exception of the sotho music it was all three chord major chords it was never a minor chord there were times when i d ask black mambazo to sing a minor chord they couldn t sing a minor chord they just didn t hear it so he put in this minor chord and i said that s interesting why d you do that he said i was just imitating the way you write i said well play this lick over it in an overdub and he did and it was a really nice mix and bakithi was playing the track has a beautiful emptiness to it i think that s part of what makes me think that it s something like sun records you know when it was just a few instruments and nothing really much except slap back echo and a song there s also another connection musically that s in there and that is there s a pedal steel guitar in there which is a of course a you know like a country instrument but it s also a west african instrument and the guy who played it his name was demola adepoju he played with king sunny ade s band you know i wanted to hear what that lick sounded like seemed like it would be a very good pedal steel lick and it was a great pedal steel lick but it was also a great ray phiri performance to me what s interesting is that ray reaches into his memory for some kind of approximation of what he thinks of as american country and bakithi plays straight ahead to the african groove and so the two you know the two musics find a commonality and the lyric expresses that don and phil everly came in and sang i always heard that songs as a perfect everly brothers song  i was down in south africa in i think february maybe early march and i think i didn t go down to memphis until maybe may brought it home and i was trying to write to it i would you know sing these lines about graceland graceland of course i wanted to get rid of the graceland part because i mean what s graceland got to do with south africa or anything like that so that s gotta go it s a question of what i m going to replace it with but then i couldn t replace it with anything i was always singing that and finally i said i don t know well maybe i m supposed to go to graceland i ve never been maybe i m supposed to go on a trip and see what i m writing about so i did and then i began to describe the trip the mississippi delta cause i was driving up from louisiana where i cut the zydeco track on graceland i was driving from highway 61 you know i m just writing about what the countryside looked like and finally got there to graceland and just made a tour through graceland but what s interesting about all of this is that the part of me that had graceland in my head i think subconsciously was reacting to what i first heard in the drums which was a kind of sun records country blues amalgam and what ray was doing was mixing up his aural recollections of what american country was and what kind of chord changes i played and so the whole song really is just one sound evoking a response and that eventually became a lyric that evoked instead of being specifically about a south african subject or even a political subject it became a traveling song that had to do with the original sound which was the drums and sub records and graceland that s really the secret of world music is people are able to listen to each other and make associations and play their own music that sounds like it fits into another culture and that s how it works and that s how it worked then the story of graceland","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"emaweni webaba silale maweni webaba silale maweni webaba silale maweni webaba silale maweni webaba silale maweni webaba siiale maweni webaba silale maweni

parts of it are missing it s still complete in the depiction started off trying to make a way then i made a wave that made a wage that lay to waste the paper chase that i was into race but how you even stop this thing i never learned so in turn i ma burn out breaks spend it faster than the churn out makes but i m a phoenix i went from ashes to classes shoebox to plastic credit could buy what ever imagined developing habits i can t kick man i was rocking cleats to a match full of baskets fast break broke the safe trying to bask in sums that wasn t real but ones and nils and they asking

or bad triumphs and tramples something i couldn t grasp i wouldn t pass i would rather struggle assembling what i can do look at that little different but the differences make it what it isn t is is whatever i want to witness behold a vision outside of the city limits where time is more valued than money for the spending ascended to deeper things never knew reasoning throwing random spices into life for the seasoning without a silver spoon i couldn t taste what i was prepping my guesses made the wooden whip a problem to a question why do my people spend more and have less than no seat to eat the meal that we responsible for cheffing imagining the window was just a mirror reflection i turned the sideline into a seat at the concession i just looked at the pictures didn t have a manual to

mean imagine if someone wore an electric chair hanging around their neck so the question that we have to ask what was different about that man on that day that could turn something that kills into something that saves see he is unique because he was innocent god actually became a man now that is different then on the cross he says i m not dying because of me i m dying because of you not just for your sins you have done but for the ones you will do then on the cross god treated jesus like he was us poured out his wrath on the son so he might show he s just see he took our filth he took our sin the beauty is when you trust in jesus you re included in him but first walk with me what it must have been like that night when the son of god looked like he lost the fight no heartbeat no beating no sign of life jesus tasted death and it didn t feel right have you ever let that sink in that jesus died no jesus actually died three days in the tomb lifeless laid his remains like the king giving up his crown like he had given up his reigns but all of a sudden come sunday something started to change from the grave you heard a thump blood started pumping in his veins heart beating blood pulsing instantly satan felt his power break because the son of god was dead but now the son of god was awake and every breath that he took was another punch to satan s face showing that we are not under our sin but we are under grace so celebrate because when jesus went to the grave you did too and when he rose from the grave you life became new he says my job is finished let your new life begin you can actually have freedom stop wallowing in your sin see the chains have been broken the stones been rolled away god doesn t love a future you he actually loves you today so you re clean you re spotless the curse has been squashed that s what baptism is it s just showing you ve been washed so rejoice with me because we aren t waiting for the verdict he already said not guilty resurrection proves he assured it because our whole lives we ve feasted on sin and we couldn t pay the tab yet jesus walks over to our bills and says i ll take care of that so stop trying to pay for your own debt in fact god doesn t really expect it because the cross shows payment given and resurrection shows payment accepted and instantly we are perfectly spotless when we were spiritual whores because when he walked out of the grave he left our sin on the floor and he turned around looked at where his body lay and said huh sin see that s where you re going to stay so church walk in freedom because you are free the resurrection is just a stamp saying it s a guarantee a royal decree proclaiming we re children of the king because when your mouth can t but your life will always sing","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"let s introduce me baby it s more to tell let s add up all the dollars problems bring out the scale won t hesitate don t push me bullets won t ever tell but we can
