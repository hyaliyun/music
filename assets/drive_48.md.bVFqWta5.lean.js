line it s the way it jerks your neck the way the body has to reflex the way stomach reacts it s the thrill concept it s the twist and the curve it s the up and the swerve it s the feeling of your nerves sitting on the front edge of their seats front row eyes open tears coming from thrill of sight moving as fast as light laughing for no reason screaming for everything you shouldn t have said in that fight rollercoasters it s like meeting god with a kite in your left hand string still twisted around your forefinger right hand still gripping the safety rail there is this moment where you feel like you re in an ocean of your butterflies this is the moment when you get free and you let your arms fly it s the fireflies and the butterflies fighting in my stomach scared to fly i might come down think i m ready now getting back in line this is the instant you let go and you let your fingers fly how you re flying now how does it feel to beat the wind you re at the zenith there are nothing but tears freedom and fear in your right hand now time to throw it in the sky now time to drown in your own thrill riding a rollercoaster is like losing your breath and finding it in your will you re jumping on the back of your fears and you re taking them for a ride you re seeing yourself when you were five it is surreal it s the things you grab and hold onto for a while you re getting ready for the drop hey you re too busy riding your fears to remember you re afraid of heights it s the butterflies and the fireflies fighting in my stomach scared to fly i might come down think i m ready now getting back in line so why is it so exciting to be so scared like feeling your heart roam through your body only to find its place in your hands but you can t wait to get back in line you gotta get on one more time can t wait to tell your friends about the drop and how it looks from the very top you see rollercoasters rollercoasters are for people who have never been in love they want to know

is your friend he once told me that i should turn to you pierre sniffed as he looked at her but he didn t speak til then he had reproached her and tried to despise her but now he felt such pity for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach he is here now tell him to tell him to forgive me yes i will tell him to forgive you but he gave me your letters no i know that all is over i know that it never can be but still i m tormented by the wrongs i ve done him tell him that i beg him to forgive forgive forgive me for everything  yes i will tell him tell him everything but but i should like to know one thing did you love did you love that bad man don t call him bad but i don t know i don t know at all she began to cry and a greater sense of pity tenderness and love overflowed pierre s heart he felt the tears begin to trickle underneath his spectacles and he hoped that no one would see we won t speak of it anymore we won t speak of it my dear but one thing i beg of you consider me your friend and if you ever need help or simply to open your heart to someone not now but when your mind is clear think of me pierre grew confused don t speak to me like that i am not worth it stop stop stop you have your whole life before you before me no all is over for me all over if i were not myself but the brightest handsomest best man on earth and if i were free i would get down on my knees this minute and ask you for your hand and for your love and for the first time in many days i weep tears of gratitude tears of tenderness tears of thanks and glancing at pierre oh pierre i leave the room smiling and restraining tears of tenderness tears of joy which choke me i throw my fur coat on my shoulders unable to find the sleeves outside my great broad chest breathes in deep the air with joy despite the ten degrees of frost and i get into my sleigh1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"this is my favorite place behind the school being here with you right now our future is so clear our

t change you couldn t help yourself from believing that i m someone that won t forget your name every now and then i pick the phone up and dial in your number and stare at it for a moment i never call i never will it s hard to focus that s what we get for throwing love into the ocean tied cutting ties stuck inside trying to make it out i string it up write the line and try and lay down if i could find the peace of mind to go and press rewind i d do it in a second if i thought that i could stay around for just a second just a goddamn second i would freeze the whole entire world in place if it let me you always told me i was gonna make a difference i just never thought it d be the kind that d eventually split us and i m sorry i never meant to leave you all alone and have you living life with a person over the phone the folks from back home say you still leave the lantern lit hoping that somebody will notice and help you manage this it wasn t anybody s fault from the moment i was

going any place people that are dragging you down cause you to compromise draining your energy then you re going to get stuck you can t hang out with chickens and expect to soar with eagles you re going to become like the people you continually associate with you wanna know what you re gonna be like in 5 years look at your friends if your friends are going places have a spirit of excellence kind generous courteous then those qualities are going to rub off on you gotta get these blessings so tired of stressing learning new lessons planning questions it s time for testing never ever resting i mma stay grinding so i stay shining like a diamond i mma stay climbing to the next level and do time and trying to line up with them bosses trying to soar high with them eagles can t chill with none of you chickens i m tray get rich with my people too high to see you haters too blessed to play y all mind i ain t got nothing to be mad at i m drop head top down thank you god all the time for helping me live my dreams and for exposing all of those who wasn t right for my team i mma keep receiving this games if it s for the better i ll change only live once better do it right i m trying

associate with other victorious people winners hang out with winners happy people around other happy people eagles soar with other eagles we don t like change we want it to be just like it was when we

that please before you try to blame me by being greedy i m just trying to be all i can be you should ve stayed down instead of knocking game now you re on the sideline watching me feeling like i m where you re supposed to be man cause you ain t see what i see i put god first and went and got it see i came in the game focused you was playing games in the projects got tired of being at the bottom trying to take my family to the top only wanna work with them winners and keep raising up my stock you still posted on the same block trying to move work out the same spot treating jail like it s in and out and every time you get out you got your hand out i don t know what your new plan but but it ain t working if you re still hurting no more excuses no more complaining just praying hard with hard working but just because somebody is related to you doesn t mean they re connected to you they may have your blood but they don t have your spirit they may not have heard the call god put on your life this doesn t make them a bad person it just means god has a different assignment for them maybe they re at a different level in their growth but they re not right for you in this season this is one of the hardest things we have to deal with letting go of people that are not supposed to be in our lives can t let you slow me down can t let you slow me down can t let you hold me down can t let you hold me down if you ain t trying to get better better move around if you ain t helping you hurting i m trying to chase that crown i pray for success i pray you re blessed i pray for your best but

people that are constantly discouraged you gotta keep them cheered up keep them fixed now i m all for helping people i m all for being a blessing sometimes we have to love people back into wholeness

you are they gray or blue i won t make the move you must make the move if you make the move i will then approve if you do not move we will surely lose don t second guess your feelings you were right
