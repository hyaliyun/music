i m free from it all ok saved at an early age in thirty days it felt like i had managed to murder most of my worldly ways worldly ways but a couple stayed and coupled with a couple years i m wondering am i missing out on the thrills i had thrown away was all this in vain strain to remain and refrain and sustain through this flame in my veins lust is his name this virgin a burden i ain t never hit the club maybe i just need a taste a lil taste a lil taste is like a little rape a lil drank a poison but can it kill a mayne a heard em say without sex life is a waste but christ is over all i kept my pants on my waist turned beautiful chicks away dudes swearin that i m lame though i got a sex drive the spirit s holding the brakes there s no breaks this is his infinite work content with my rib nothing is sweet enough to desert her see some of y all done bought the lie that sex is what makes you a man but that s not what makes you a man anybody can go lay with a woman what makes you a man is being defined by who you say you are in christ if you have christ you have all that you need everything you need is bound up in the resurrected savior look can i be real with you they say that women want attention that s the real issue and if they only wore dresses just a little bit longer then the flesh that i be feeding wouldn t burn like a sauna wait is that the reason why your brain is in chains when you at home by yourself in front of computer screens or is that the reason why sick men prey on little girls still in school still playing with crayons no it s the flesh that all men should fight while satan persist to tempt us with our own wicked delights see god made intimacy to glorify he the flesh wanna do as we please glorify we that girl is not an object for playing that s a woman not a barbie i don t care what nicki say and just like her sex is god s creation you spit inside his face when you don t use it how he made it  sex is a gift from god but we ve taken it and made it idolatry we ve taken it and put it in the place of god and we worship it and so it comes out in all kinds of profane ways and so we blame the women for what they re wearing and we blame the media for what they re producing but we never blame ourselves for how we ve twisted god s gift to glorify us flesh on the rise like the tide when i go surfing you can see just what i prize in my life when i go searching roaming with my eyes no surprise sin is lurking get s me every time and inside man i m hurting pretending that i m fine but it s a lie man i m burdened cause what s inside is never satisfied so i serve it afraid of getting caught so i hide i m so nervous scared that i may die begging christ to reverse it lord you are the gospel such a bad scene even if i clear my history my past ain t clean and i can try clean it up but it never seems enough i trust myself then hurt myself fail this is tough i need the gospel clear see my sin for what it is one brings life the other death man to me plus my kids selfish in my ways and it s gon put me in the grave but christ can save and set you free no longer be enslaved my spirit willing but my flesh weak and this moment is but a test see yeah lord you re greater than all these pleasures i just wanna see you as my treasure god i wanna flee from it all til i m free from it all flee from it all til i m free from it all flee from it all til i m free from it all flee from it all til i m free from it all manning up is not just managing your sexual temptations it s not just managing your sin that s not what it means to be a man because you can try harder and you can do better and you can hang on longer that s not manning up manning up is our ability to lay down all of our effort and all of our trying and all of our strength and say i trust in jesus i trust in his perfection i trust in his power i trust in his resurrection because he s the only one that can get me through this and he s the only one that can make me

facades that we ll retire i only recently believed that we ve got tires in our souls that don t weary any time we go to drive em we re the suicide kids we only think about ourselves and keep secrets like i won t tell and up on suicide hill where we climbed high as hell we used to hide out and try to find ourselves we are the suicide kids we only think about ourselves and keep secrets like i won t tell and up on suicide hill when we got high as hell we used to hide out and try too hard to find ourselves and so i started liking english it managed my expressions and felt like wet cement it could carry my impressions what if the butterflies inside our stomachs are still hatching or imagine that we search the dirt pile and find the hatchets that we buried in light of all this faith that i still can t believe you left it on the trampoline when you were barely teen i mean we traveled to september the summer killing month and missed the cigarette kisses and the poems that i wrote that sucked but on that white hospital bed you watched your brother cry now i swear i ll shave my head grow out my hair some other time cause i ve been fighting things myself i can be his savior i cleaned my room and emptied out those medicine containers so that i can take this pencil the one meant for the book report use up all its graphite on emotions i ve been looking for lose myself inside a childhood of looking forward well whatever life just took its course i hope you re looking for  you are my favorite miracle i have seen you in a field of marigolds but i m glad i don t have to give my prayers to you cause i know we ll make it through whatever happens and on that white hospital bed we ll watch each other lie and swear that it s forever on the tattoos that we cover i don t believe in miracles but i have at other times and i believe that i can carry all your troubles i swear on that white hospital bed we ll watch each other lie and swear that it s forever on the scars that we cover i don t believe in miracles but i have at other times and i believe that i can carry all your troubles i swear that i mma take this pencil the one meant for the book report use up all its graphite on emotions i ve been looking for lose myself inside a childhood of looking forward well whatever life just took its course i hope you re looking for the suicide kids in every person that you haven t met and all the perfect places that we haven t been to yet all the cameras and the passed out floors that i haven t mentioned yet you give em hell kid and never let yourself forget cause we ve all got higher hills to climb regardless of our depths but i would never look to suicide if i had nothing left i would simply form a smile thinking back on all my friends and read the book report i wrote so many

its songs competed like kids for space we stared for hours in our maker s face they gave us picks said go mine the sun and go gold and come back when you re done while you were sleeping you tossed you turned you rolled your eyes as the world burned the heavens fell the earth quaked i thought you must be but you weren t awake no you were dreaming you ignored the sun you grew your power garden for your little ones and you found brides for them on christmas eve they hung young cain from the adam trees and danced while you were sleeping i tossed and i turned til i closed my eyes but the future burned through the planet turned a hair gray as i relived the day while you were sleeping the money died machines were harmless and the earth sighed through the wind you swept sound and gravity caught my love around the oceans rose sang about decay while witches flew and the mermaids stayed full of dreams you overslept and keeping with the quiet through the walls i crept i walked on tiptoe sent darkness swirling over all the kitchen in the early morning i ll never catch up to you who sleeps so sound my arms are useless my heart beats too loud to go to sleep my mind s too proud to bow out while you were sleeping the time changed all your things were rearranged your vampire mirrors face to face they saw forever out into space and found you dreaming in black and white while it rained in all the colors of the night i watched the tvs memories championships vanished to sea can it be my honey between you and me so i waited for the riddled sky to dissolve again by the sunrise and i ve made a death suit for life for my father s ill widowed wife did you have that strangest dream before you woke cause in your gown you had the butterfly stroke did it escape you like some half told joke when you reached for your plume of smoke it ll haunt you my honey bee anyone who is anyone has that same dream were you falling were you flying and were you calling out or were you dying thank god you re up now let s stay this way else there ll be no mornings and no more days cause when we re dreaming the babies grow the sun shines and the shadows flow time flies the phone rings there is a silence
