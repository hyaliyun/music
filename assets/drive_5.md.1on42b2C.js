my fingers blister the picture i m painting the vivid description the vision lyricism niggas i written i rose from the rubble you ll never surpass it the phoenix that flew with the truth of the masses i ma get a motherfuckin sound that you regurgitated people lookin at me like you really want it elevated never hesitated take my brain out while i meditated i was highly medicated save your reservation for another cadence you could try to keep up with the pace if you put me in the cypher with niggas i m out of place i murder an instrumental turn it into fragments spittin the fast raps a mother fucking distraction i cultivate a different sound that i would give em just a little mother fucker that was coming out of maryland captivate them with i guarantee i embarrass them and take them on a ride make sure they feeling the vibe my flow is really alive and you was lookin surprised at the way this mother fucker would make a rhythm collide it was difficult depending on the way that i say it and what a nigga displaying i bet i make a statement i was caught up in a vision of giving cause i was reliving now give me your fucking minute so people can feel this sentence i kill em with kinaesthetics while keepin it copacetic but niggas are prototypical people fake as prosthetics and i ll probably never get it i swear to god that i m honest the definition of truth the proof is in my compite plus i got a couple mother fucking bodies in the closet with a new noose hanging from the ceiling revealing i was alone for a while as a child i would live inside my isolation my self preservation s amazing on several occasions i came to a somber conclusion that life s an illusion confusing the way that i view it is darker than you and yo kinfolk so keep with the tempo by giving you vast amounts of info i pray i m forgiven for sins before i go never been the same see i been a nigga that s giving effort that you would never forget and you was quick to expect this mother fucker to talk about some ignorance a diamond color chain it s a pain when the colors change when it s glistening so now i got you motherfuckers listening positionin myself to where my intentions are interjectin if i ever make it then realism is in effect i give an intermission the vision for what you lack and it s actual fucking content don t you have a conscience this myriad of topics and you was speaking that non sense the shit that i provided was similar to an antidote my educated guess is impressin and i m professing that i was given the prominence complements of the most high a salaam aleikum aleikum salaam for the nigga with the bowtie what is a material i m ready for the afterlife i got a date with destiny my ridiculous appetite i eat that mother fucker you probably wouldn t believe it the beat is leaking a liter whenever that nigga speakin i said that my shit s egregious the legacy i was leaving i m feigning to find my sanity sanctifying on my inhibition you know that i m abusing i wouldn t ever retrieve it you know that i could proceed ya got the existential feeling they want it from the beginning i try to make it apparent they focus up on appearance and what a nigga was wearing apparent never opinion that mother fuckers were giving and i was living to die i wanted to make a masterpiece i m working like a starving artist departed from fallacies i m feeling like a mental patient my life is insanity they put me on a pill to differentiate a fantasy from actual reality self esteem is a casualty i m acting so erratically imagining a life i know that i could never lead and i m encompassing everything that you should never be cause you fell in love with the melody while ignoring the message the undertone of the reckoning is really reactionary it varies upon the words and the people that i would say it too defending you to try and free your mind is what i m finna do my vision wasn t miniscule and when you at the bottom is when the person ll ridicule i pray it never gets to you i promise if you keep it cool and stay composed and everything you do will have a better view but that s if your intentions were honest from the beginning when you do it for the love and you never receive a penny and people just see the product and follow it up when they be automatically assume that your money is on boom and find the prodigal son and i get the crucifixion resurrected on the seventh day i need a fucking witness they could document it and show you i was legendary i ve been feeling like a god repentance is necessary lord fuck with it i ll just talk a bunch of random shit i don t give a fuck abstract art download that shit if you haven t yet it s not out now while we re recording this it s gonna be out by the time we re done recording what

empty room trying to forget the past this was never meant to last i wish it wasn t so i know what it takes to move on i know how it feels to lie all i want to do is trade this life for something new holding on to what i haven t got  what was left when that fire was gone i thought it felt right but that right was wrong all caught up in the eye of the storm and trying to figure out what it s like moving on and i don t even know what kind of things i said my mouth kept moving and my mind went dead so i m picking up the pieces now where to begin the hardest part of ending is starting again all i want to do is trade this life for something new holding on to what i haven t got this is not the end this is not the beginning just a voice like a riot rocking every revision but you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm though the words sound steady something empty s within them we say yeah with fists flying up in the air like we re holding onto something that s invisible there cause we re

strand all around the town s perimeter he chased me with his scimitar a powerful passion limiter to an errant in his pride through the waterside he chased me to the bridge of foyle he raced me and at derry quay he faced me so i jumped into the tide sure bravery s no virtue when some heathen s trying to hurt you and all noble thoughts desert you when you see his curly knife for there s many things worth trying for and occasionally worth lying for but there s bugger all worth dying for so i ll stick to the soldier s life","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"young roger the miller came courting of late

was the king of the alley mama i could talk some trash i was the prince of the paupers crowned downtown at the beggar s bash i was the pimp s main prophet i kept everything cool just a backstreet gambler with the luck to lose and when the heat came down it was left on the ground the devil appeared like jesus through the steam in the street showin me a hand i knew even the cops couldn t beat i felt his hot breath on my neck as i dove into the heat it s so hard to be a saint when you re just a boy out on the street and the sages of the subway sit just like the living dead as the tracks clack out the rhythm their eyes fixed straight ahead they ride the line of balance and hold on by just a thread but it s too hot in these tunnels you can get hit up by the heat you get up to get out at your next stop but they push you back down in your seat your heart starts beatin faster as you struggle to your feet then you re outa that hole and back up on the street and them south side sisters sure

states no doubt in school i always knew that it was you who d get out i heard you dumped christine but that was probably what 2003 i bet you ve got a super hot wife or three you were always such a player when we were sixteen i hope our paths cross sometime i can t seem to find your profile online drop me a call any day or night is fine because i d love to see your face after such a long time i

to you makes me feel better cause sometimes when it s dark or it s really bad weather i feel like i might just feel down forever last night i really felt that might have been it like i just couldn t deal with any more shit i wanted to disappear and if i think that i did it would be at least a week before it went noticed i wanna go back back to when we were kids when we didn t know pain could feel like this when we didn t know hurt and we didn t know risk but we all grew up and i guess that s it i always felt like you ve known me i thought of you when i got lonely now there s nothing else i can do this is me reaching out to you dear you it s strange how quickly we can lose sight i called your old landline late last night i remembered those numbers since 99 anyway suppose i called because you hadn t replied i got through to your parents they were so surprised they asked me if i still lived down park drive i got the worst feeling when i heard your dad cry when your mum took the phone and went outside man she told me how hard you tried that it didn t work out with your kids and wife i nearly dropped the phone and had tears in my eyes when she said you took your own life last july i always felt like i d known you i never thought you would be lonely now there s nothing else i can do this is me reaching out to you","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i live in a glass house but i m

him though i just see him in school while passing me usually followed by two kids giggling in back of him i don t know why they feel the need to interfere and i ll be honest the kid is obviously a little weird he s got a stutter plus always talks to himself but it is clear to me they shouldn t mess with him he probably wish they d disappear like yeah he s different so he ain t causing harm to anyone yeah he might annoy them not on purpose though he s never done something intentionally offensive like these other kids like yelling stop being a retard when they see him mumbling or called him a faggot when he s saying something awkward yeah he lives with it but he shouldn t have too any longer he s just a kid like any of us matter of fact next time i see him i ma say something and have his back the next day ain t any better they re abusing him everyday gets worse cause people accept it as they become used to it and he don t stand up but what can you do with that hate against you you call em out he s called a spaz with some anger issues they hear but they don t listen senseless they re hearing that bullies are everywhere thinking that here must be the exception but it s so alive and its so true they got open eyes but they don t view they got growing minds that they don t use and its pulverizing our whole youth but to be honest most of these bullies don t mean any harm they re just kids like any of us they like to be in charge they like attention but just lack guidance in getting it so they put others down none of us are always innocent but that don t make it right cause again i m watching andy get tortured by two of his peers with no reason in sight and i know he knows i watch and he sees me paying attention and it s getting worse and worse i hope he knows that i respect him yeah the next day andy didn t show up to school and i was nervous he always came to this class i wonder what was the purpose the same class had the two kids who been messing with him but without a target both of them just blended right in twenty minutes later the class was pretty quiet as andy walks through the door he was shaking and crying as all heads slowly in sync turned he pauses then pulls a pistol out of his front pocket the girls screamed the boys sat there terrified nobody expected this but everyone knew the reason why and before anyone could say something fully within seconds two bullets flew into his bullies more screams as the bodies collapsed i felt i should say something cause i was the only one who had his back i said it s over andy they re dead you had
