residents of the earth and we all go through issues in life it s like if you re not really ready then you can end up in pieces your peace of mind turns to sediment settled into a verse the pursuit of happiness has its perks i m circulating these verbs bringing that relevance i levitate over obstacles any fear is a detriment peddling past treacherous past evidence i m delegating all this evidence and revolutionaries know what the consensus is these sentences are metaphors i let m pour i kick this medicine meddlin with your mind defying these petulant lies brethren i experiment with paragraphs so whenever you play this on your premises i hope you hear the emphasis the hourglass is steady moving so i keep momentum i mention these sixty fours you pause for that venom everything that i do is blasÂ¨Â¦ large bars if you come through my pathway and i m tellin them i recommend you chill recognize i m wrecking guys with these words and mc s see the reckoning so let me know how you feel i won t be surprised when it s finally revealed i will take the time to unwind and be still it s wild when it s real but we just decided to chill uh i mean why would you hold it in when you ve got stories to tell so many lost odysseys stuck in your shelf quick visits to my past life s archive for the things you ve never seen like i was writing in braille sweet release when you design it yourself the finer details this is really defining the tale so many bars in my mind sometimes i feel i m sitting inside of a cell with never ending sentences not even time would tell it won t snitch throw those stones it won t get broken bones hold with no sticks so we stay fly through the turbulence and all of these occurrences and shrugging off these storms until these swords have served their purposes cause the world will always act like it s courteous but ain t got your back like invertebrates so we burn the bridge make sure that the verse serves with this we ll find the burning fish yeah burn till it s crisp  so let me know how you feel i won t be surprised when it s finally revealed i will take the time to unwind and be still it s wild when it s real but we just decided to chill i can t deny we re all the same it s still light and closed blinds and no time to complain hues of bluer skies simplify why i define the moments think less chill and recline mellow deep we can rhyme take a load off your mind come into space via the brazen ways honing my day to make a dream display ah so let me know how you feel i won t be surprised when it s finally revealed i will take the time to unwind and be still it s wild when it s real but we just decided to chill chill chill we just decided to chill we just decided to chill 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"only heaven knows about this treasure hide it

we set up traps to catch the beasts before they bite they come from under and they try to take you from your life we followed footprints down to the lake we lost the scent two shadows cast from outer

wheel shut down anyone with any sense had already left town he was standing in the doorway looking like the jack of hearts he moved across the mirrored room set it up for everyone he said then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin could you kindly tell me friend what time the show begins then he moved into the corner face down like the jack of hearts backstage the girls were playing five card stud by the stairs lily had two queens she was hoping for a third to match her pair outside the streets were filling up the window was open wide a gentle breeze was blowing you could feel it from inside lily called another bet and drew up the jack of hearts big jim was no one s fool he owned the town s only diamond mine he made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine with his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place he took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste but his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the jack of hearts rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town she slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown she fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear sorry darling that i m late but he didn t seem to hear he was staring into space over at the jack of hearts i know i ve seen that face somewhere big jim was thinking to himself maybe down in mexico or a picture up on somebody s shelf but then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim and in the darkness of the room there was only jim and him staring at the butterfly who just drew the jack of hearts  lily was a princess she was fair skinned and precious as a child she did whatever she had to do she had that certain flash every time she smiled she had come away from a broken home had lots of strange affairs with men in every walk of life which took her everywhere but she d never met anyone quite like the jack of hearts the hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined the drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind it was known all around that lily had jim s ring and nothing would ever come between lily and the king no nothing ever would except maybe the jack of hearts rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife she was tired of the attention tired of playing the role of big jim s wife she had done a lot of bad things even once tried suicide was looking to do just one good deed before she died she was gazing to the future riding on the jack of hearts lily took her dress off buried it away has your luck run out she laughed at him well i guess you must have known it would someday be careful not to touch the wall there s a brand new coat of paint i m glad to see you re still alive you re looking like a saint down the hallway footsteps were coming for the jack of hearts the backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair there s something funny going on he said i can just feel it in the air he went to get the hanging judge but the hanging judge was drunk as the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk there was no actor anywhere better than the jack of hearts no one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick the door to the dressing room burst open and a colt revolver clicked and big jim was standing there ya couldn t say surprised rosemary right beside him steady in her eyes she was with big jim but she was leaning to the jack of hearts two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall and cleaned out the bank safe it s said that they got off with quite a haul in the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground for one more member who had business back in town but they couldn t go no further without the jack of hearts the next day was hanging day the sky was overcast and black big jim lay covered up killed by a penknife in the back and rosemary on the gallows she didn t even blink the hanging judge was sober he hadn t had a drink the only person on the scene missing was the jack of hearts the cabaret was empty now a sign said closed for repair lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair she was thinking bout her father who she very rarely saw thinking bout rosemary and thinking about the law but most of all she was thinking bout the

49 and went to detroit working on assembly line the first year they had me putting wheels on cadillacs every day i d watch them beauties roll by and sometimes i d hang my head and cry because i always wanted me one that was long and black one day i devised myself a plan that should be the envy of most any man i d sneak it out of there in a lunchbox in my hand now getting caught meant getting fired but i figured i d have it all by the time i retired i d have me a car worth at least a hundred grand i d get it one piece at a time and it wouldn t cost me a dime you d know it s me when i come through your town i m going to ride around in style i m going to drive everybody wild because i ll have the only one there is around so the very next day when i punched in with my big lunchbox and with help from my friend i left that day with a lunchbox full of gears i ve never considered myself a thief but gm wouldn t miss just one little piece especially if i strung it out over several years the first day i got me a fuel pump and the next day i got me an engine and a trunk then i got me a transmission and all of the chrome the little things i could get in my big lunchbox like nuts and bolts and all four shocks but the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy s mobile home now up to now my plan went all right until we tried to put it all together one night and that s when we noticed that something was definitely wrong the transmission was a 53 and the motor turned out to be a 73 and when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone so we drilled it out so that it would fit and with a little bit of help from an a daptor kit we had that engine running just like a song now the headlights they was another sight we had two on the left and one on the right but when we pulled out the switch all three of them come on the back end looked kind of funny too but we put it together and when we got through well that s when we noticed that we only had one tail fin about that time my wife walked out and i could see in her eyes that she had her doubts but she opened the door and said honey take me for a spin so we drove up town just to get the tags and i headed her right on down main drag i could hear everybody laughing for blocks around but up there at the courthouse they didn t laugh because to type it up it took the whole staff and when they got through the title weighed sixty pounds  i got it one piece at a time and it didn t cost me a dime you ll know it s me when i come through your town i m going to ride around in style i m going to drive everybody wild because i

and the murmur of half dreams whisper seductively and stage scenes it s fear fiction these visions caught somewhere between delusion and prophesy what i haven t done what i ve wanted to and what i fear you have becomes reality here bright lights in the young night keep to the beat a classic party scene crowded and interesting no love no life no history just touch just chemistry just a roaring undercurrent simple and sensory young bodies warm skin perfect symmetry and it s a moment harmless it s energy it s like medicine it s self discovery see all the secrets i keep why are they secrets it s only temporary that fleeting feeling of warmth just a flash before the line gets blurry between a longing for more than what the body wants now and what the body wants now more than anything was it integrity that kept my hands to myself or just the thought of getting too far ahead of you was it that i got too tired of the consequence or was i just scared i only know i never wanted to get left behind no pauses not a second guess first a swaying then a stumble then a swagger they re just movements towards feeling it doesn t matter neither hesitates to carry on a kind of energy sweat and block out everything to find every aperture and compel the animal parts fan flames taste fruit taste bitter fruit just trying to learn how all the wires in the body work just trying to feel it out it s like medicine trap the healing in whatever bed they end up in i want to feel it out i want to know how it works i want to know if it was worth it to worry about the ghosts i feared would haunt the memory about the damage that i m sure the fear has done to me now i want to know what it is in me that won t follow through those nights the instinct takes a hold of me and pushes too maybe it s only that i ve never gotten over you or am i still scared i see the church steps a vision is there fiction in this one too it s true i ve made a tale of it here still it s a little unclear who s been haunting who and time can be such a funny thing always moving to the future glorifying the past and amplifying the pain in frames and glass so was our touch half as sacred as i ve made it seem or just another fabrication of a half dream just those chemicals the adolescent love just us trying to grasp onto meaning onto a purpose onto a sense that something spiritual releases when the feeling hits and when the feeling hits and in that moment sparks and harps play out a sweeping melody through fog and fantasy and in that moment there s an honesty instinctive and pure but it departs like it came rapid and bearing no more than fleeting ecstasy of natural harmony they fear the notes being played and try to sing along don t be ashamed be free to the feeling don t be ashamed keep feeling but find it a body that makes sense i ve felt it4","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"woohoo i don t know what you want and i don t want to know i got you where i want and i won t let go so get your kicks out quick

realize almost everything that i believed in my life was a lie it started as a child first was santa claus then i believed that a broad would never come between my dawgs wrong my sister mary filled me in when i was seven told me hulk hogan only existed on television the stone cold stunner and the leg drop all scripted n w o and x pac dang i used to walk up to them automatic doors my momma told me that my finger was the power source so i pointed with my pointer then pow it was open then come to find out she was jokin had to let it soak in my mind as a boy didn t wanna believe that mcgwire or barry were on the roids but uh when i was young i thought the world was alright it s funny i even thought that jesus was white but yo all that glitters ain t made of gold it s the thing you ve heard a million times before i know i know it took a little time now i realize now i know better it s better late than never now i know over the years you get more accustomed to pain used to believe my dad when he d say he d come to my games even believed my mother was a saint and could do no wrong and then she sat me down and told me how i was born mind blown but now it all makes sense why she didn t spazz on me when she caught me havin sex i was perplexed but now i get it i used to think america was finished with racism how could i miss it i m mad so many people don t get it holdin this list of black names but now i m blacklisted got older it s like it got no different i found out that these independent artists isn t independent cause major labels fund them quietly to keep perception that s deception in the game used to believe i wanted fame plus my name written in them lights now i know it s so much greater cause it s written in the hand of christ then i i used to say the radio would play what the people wanted now i know they playin what s payin feelin jaded but somehow i still believe in god i even thought a college education got me a job man  all that glitters ain t made of gold it s the thing you ve heard a million times before it took a little time now i realize now i know better it s better late than never now i know now i know better yes i know better now i know better yes i know better now i know better yes i know better now i know better yes i know better now i know too many times i know i know i know better alright alright
