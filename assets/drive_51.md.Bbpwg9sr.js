everything i ever wanted is a breath away but all of it could fade in a single day so what s the fame i m over that cuz sooner or later every man s fame fades to black so i look to the sky think about the purpose that could pass me by livin everyday like i m never gon die if i ain t wise then what the hell am i i think about the pain that i ve been through and if i could go back then i would do it cuz i know all the pain is for nothing if praying for something to keep me from suffering is only gonna be another reason i ain t gon shine one day i m gon finally be everything that i ever dreamed so let the world try and hold me back i keep my head up at the stars and hustle until i get there cuz nothing in life nobody in life is gonna steal my shine nothing s gonna steal my shine spotlight overdose ask yourself what it is you want the most a minute in this game chasing all the fame hiding all your pain just so people know your name then all the sudden that fame is gone and your shine is dead like a forgotten song when the fans don t scream and your phone don t ring and you ve sold your soul to a devil in a suit for a deal and an empty dream what you got left but just a memory of what you used to be if life s a breath then let it echo through eternity pour out my pain and suffering write out my broken heart a song for every scar like every scar s a gift from god i want to shine light that ain t never gonna fade when the stage goes black when everything i love makes pain my past and i can be the reason that i never look back i think about the dirt that i ve been through and all the good in my life that i did do so i m living for the moment never think about the struggle i don t ever wanna give another minute to a record label stealing my shine  one day i m gon finally be everything that i ever dreamed so let the world try and hold me back i keep my head up at the stars and hustle until i get there cuz nothing in life nobody in life is gonna steal my shine nothing s gonna steal my shine","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"my dear friends romans countrymen let me get your eardrums and the mind s inside the head they re in everything in life moves in cycles like the
