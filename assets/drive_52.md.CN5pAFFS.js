of hip hop jay z has long been cast aside as his businessman status dominates kanye west is kanye west lil wayne for better or worse has been the one to carry hip hop s mainstream torch since his mid 2000s mixtape run and now has been is willingly applied to his reign because of his appearance on the new rich gang cut take kare with young thug quality of the song regardless these few minutes contain incalculable symbolic weight first a quick primer on the thug wayne relationship when young thug burst onto the rap scene his 2011 debut effort i came from nothing resembled a manifestation of good artists borrow great artists steal this was an unapologetic imitation of the late 2000s lil wayne no matter how hard journalists tried to pry only wayne s name came up as an influence on thug but as young thug s development as a rapper turned into a development as an artist in every sense of the word the wayne training wheels began to fall off thugger got weirder thugger looked deeper into himself and the birdman co sign that brought on the inevitable collaboration we have before us is an inverse of what said collaboration would have sounded like in 2011 this sound is different in two key ways how the rapping is done and when each rapper spits the post migos flow that young thug as with his lil wayne influences crafts into his own indistinguishably euphoric style becomes the flow employed by wayne the placing of wayne on the back end of the track in normal times says very little but the length of time it takes before any semblance of wayne appears tells that this is a thug track a thug spotlight and a thug coronation at this point the wayne imitation of thug says everything in its style that needn t be examined lyrically for an artist whose career was founded on mimicking lil wayne weezy is the least similar rich gang member to what the world of young thug sounds like for an incomparable marketer like birdman thrusting an artist into the spotlight exemplifies the flawless strategy so far employed regarding thugger s rich gang ascendance to address the requisite doubt that comes with heaping praise and impactful claims such as these young thug has reached the point where i just want to nut she say that s easy like a baker can t be dismissed as a wack line lil wayne knows something about a peak like that26","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the price of fame

that keeps you ever gentle on my mind it s not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted on their columns now that bind me or something that somebody said because they thought we fit together walking it s just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving when i walk along some railroad track and find that you re moving on the backroads by the rivers of my memory and for hours you re just gentle on my mind though the wheat fields and the clothes lines and the junkyards and the highways come between us and some other woman s cryin to her mother cause she turned and i was gone i still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face and the summer sun might burn me til i m blind but not to where i cannot see you walkin on the backroads by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind i dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin cracklin cauldron in some train yard my beard a roughnin coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face through cupped hands round the tin can i pretend to

when you still ain t got today i woke up and realized every day gets shorter every minute turns to the longest second yet never ending age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn t tell you how old or young minded someone is cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman s legs but each have our own finish line understand it never ends and the only way to be immortalized is to be remembered hopefully from right than wrong better to be in the hall of fame than shame whether it exists for what you do or not we create this world so we make what exists it isn t about the award it s about the award of being immortalized and remembered for all the right reasons mistakes are forgotten no footprints of any missteps so when it s so late that it s early and you need a drink even though the bar s closed remember why you do what you do for the coldest drinks the fastest cars luxury the adrenaline rush of creating what you think about with who thinks about you your family your team the joy of looking back and saying that you did it winning the game hall of fame14","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"hardest work that ever i done been beneath that burning sun hauling that tobacco

and i knew that my world was you it s not a moment you can capture on film but even so i ll never let it disappear you are a song and every last note is carved into my heart this is our rainbow colored symphony every day a symphony a beautiful sound i ve never known a melody no one can play alone crying laughing from hello do re mi fa sol all of our emotions form this symphony i breathe a sigh and watch the sky as it collects this little hopeless puff of air there are a thousand cherry blossom petals twirling to a silent song up there i spin around and around and around and around and then spin right around i m waiting patiently for spring but i don t know if i can bear it without you around don t you know you have a little magic in you it wipes away the monochrome hue and fills this world with color when you laugh beside me hey let s go and make the most of today our time is precious they say and i wanna spend it all with you you were the one you were always the one you were the light in my life when you re with me we can take on the night shining like stars in the sky don t hide away never hold back your tears trying so hard to be strong only for you i d gather the stars cause with you is where they belong  after the storm has passed i looked up to sky that brilliant blue a bittersweet goodbye i remember how we laughed it always makes me smile in a single beat both our paths began to meet so i ll take a vow here and now as we re shining bright among a million stars a single love is born a burning light to last the test of time when the winter turns to spring and today into the next it s a symphony of each and every dream we were walking side by side just a single step away i wish i could recall what had made us laugh at all how i miss the magic of those ordinary days even now it s still all so clear and your voice is the music i hear you are still the orange of the sunset in my dreams i just really wish that you were here cause inside my dreams it s not enough to hear your voice once more that s all i m asking for we ll pick up our duet cause it can t be finished yet i just really wish that you were here to compose another memory i promise when i find i m missing you i ll play our symphony3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"1972 daddy drove a nova it was sky blue he worked at a record store after school called sympathy for the vinyl 1972 turntable
