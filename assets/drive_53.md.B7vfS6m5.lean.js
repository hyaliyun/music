head i just could not believe it to think that she was real and as i tried to tell her she said shhh i know just how you feel and if you want to come here with me then that s all right with me cause i ve been oh so lonely lovin someone is a better way to be anywhere s a better place to be the mornin come so swiftly but i held her in my arms but she slept like a baby snug and safe from harm i did

saying it s time that i moved on the waitress took her bar rag and she wiped it across her eyes and as she spoke her voice came out as something like a sigh she said i wish that i was beautiful or that you were halfway blind and i wish i weren t so doggone fat i wish that you were mine and i wish that you d come with me when i leave for home for we both know all about loneliness and livin all alone and the little man looked at the empty glass in his hand and he smiled a crooked grin he said i guess i m outta gin and i know we both have been so lonely and if you want me to come with you

deeper but i m not so brave and like that i was torn out and thrown in the sky and i said all my prayers because surely i ll die as i crashed down and smashed into earth into dirt how my skin did explode leaving only my shirt but from shirt grew a tree and then tree grew a fruit and i became the seed and that seed was a brute and i clawed through the ground with my roots and my leaves and i tore up the shirt and i ate up the sleeves and they laughed out at me and said what is your plan but their question was foreign i could not understand when then suddenly i m ripped up and placed into a mouth and it swallowed me down at which time i head south so i said hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya hey hey hey hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya hey hey hey hey ya ya hey ya ya hey ya ya hey hey hey hey

awe at that beautiful sight and i dreamt about climbing into the night sky but i knew had i touched them they d mouth back bye bye so i got up and walked down the path in the dark and there deep in the distance my eye caught a spark of a crab twice my size with incredible strength oh it greeted me kindly and then we all drank and we drooled out together right onto the ground and the ocean grew quickly right up all around and the earth looked at me and said wasn t that fun and i replied i m sorry if i hurt anyone and without even thinking cast me into space but before she did that she wiped off my own face she said better luck next time don t worry so much without ears i couldn t hear i could just feel the touch as i fell asleep softly at the edge of a cave but i should have gone deeper

either live lavish or you wait most only make enough to buy new paint for their next project but what color best represents honest that is without yet absorbs all concept what artist absorbs every other artist and illustrates the obvious in a way that we haven t thought yet what artist can do no wrong or does wrong so well that it s convincingly right the youth is living through death by simply taking their time like it can t be taken away by a reaper who doesn t let us overpopulate she says some get to go but some gotta stay at home for most hell is simply just being in one place and for some heaven is never having to show your face all the things we make just to hide behind getting high on our own supply makes art is no longer a needle in the hay but a syringe in the needles because everyone s got a point but they care so very little originality junkies waiting for their chance to say something they re waiting for their names to be mentioned devising a plan to make themselves so important by doing absolutely as little as possible taking advantage of the impressionable impersonating a hero as if you understand what darkness that title holds but i don t think you do because sadly the truth is being without suffering is like being without parents what could guide a human more than pain what will sculpt a carving better than a blade all these rich kids are orphans with over stimulated endorphins strung out on their heroine mother and meth head father with enough money to ensure that you will never be poor enough to experience true happiness for some it takes being deprived to feel alive others know the value of life without an attempt at death and i can t stress it enough i m stressed enough as it is so i take my time like it can t be taken away don t tell me you re biting the bullets when all your problems are blank i swear that i used to have a mind that s full but now my head just aches from all these kids that are so colorful and quick to throw the shade when you re the only one to blame for forgetting that the world is not the past tense of whirl even if our lives seem stagnate if we had a perfect view of the planet through glass could we look past our reflection to see it or do we just see ourselves pretending to take the view in acting like we give a shit for the sake of the viewership that s already sunken we are an audience in a submarine falling deeper into ocean water and calling it space we are a group of people with the same thoughts as our ancestors still left with no answers still left with no way too clever to show that we have no idea what to do with the day so we wait for the night because it s easier to plague tomorrow with the burden of sobriety crossing our fingers that the sun is gone for good so we don t have to be drunk driving my own hearse in all white because everyday i was alive i wore nothing but black because black is the only thing that is honest it doesn t pretend to be something it isn t it doesn t desire it doesn t weep it doesn t exist and that s what makes it honest because when you are nothing you can do no wrong2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"maybe you re right but i don t like the

between worlds wish she could tell em hold on i m waiting between worlds he was looking at a pale sun rise thinking back on the time gone by how he loved and he laughed and he cried how it was a blink of an eye now he s looking at the shake in his hand thinking how much more of life can he stand and how many years can he cram before his fate gives way and he s ash in the sand and is it the last stop on the road or the next step in a path grand and unknown a milestone formed from the fruits of his ways okay in what comes with the end of his days but the sun s rays shine on a face so divine an angel of mine goes the phrase in his mind wise to the signs knowing soon is the time but he isn t ready to say goodbye hold on he s waiting between worlds wish he could tell em hold on i m waiting between worlds 4 a m when she woke to the sound walked to the door in her bedtime gown policeman said that her son s been found he was shot in the head near a club downtown and the terror in her heart was profound her legs broke down she collapsed to the ground as the walls were spinning all around he said ma am please you need to come right now so she s sitting down dazed in a cop car swerving through lanes in a maze where the crazed are and locked in a haze from the shock thoughts frayed as they stop with here stomach in knots lord please end the nightmare are the words in her mind as they raced inside lord please end the nightmare in the hospital ward in the eye of the storm miss i regret to say there s not much hope i can give today the assault took much of his brain away we ve done all we can but his state is grave best case here is he ll live on machines with a vegetable quality of life foreseen or instead we can pull out the feed let him live his last moments and he ll pass in a dream hold on we re waiting between worlds wish she could tell em hold on we re waiting between worlds waiting between worlds that divide through a choice undefined a break in the line where all paths intertwine and no roads lead or progress behind and all signs read know the way decide they say all things never truly die but change in existence and switch design like a drain to an ocean in which we re blind we remain set in motion from worlds combined so if i had one thought that would last and hold amass and fold over as it fastly grows and fuse into life like a fabric sewn clasp the vast field whence existence flows i d say settle down of your grief let go this world s nothing more than a magic show though tragic at times and encased in woe it all works out of this truth i know5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot gimmie the loot loot loot loot loot

the flames rise higher let every man be considered a liar if he doubts the goodness and faithfulness of god itching ears will compulsively nod in approval when unbelief is taught in all our temples

city from the windows high above the streets a few concerned women called out to him to keep his voice down for his own sake for all their safety i m so tired of giving up i am so tired of giving in

noticing where he was heading he d reached his home or his former home his mother s house she d vanished three years ago he hadn t been back since his father had been gone now for nearly ten heading around back he made a straight line for a small workshop set apart from the house his father s motorbike was there a relic a gas engine bolted to an iron frame he kicked the engine a few times and the bike roared to life as he turned onto the street and opened the throttle the sound of combustion savaging the silence of the night air he could almost make out the sound of the collective gasp let out by the neighborhood he could almost imagine window after window opening above the street line frightened face after frightened face leaning out into the bright glow of the streetlamps timid voice after timid voice telling him speaking in unison a chorus of fear ooh don t turn your back on the city ooh don t turn your back on the city ooh don t turn your back on the city ooh don t turn your

for all the fathers who still remember 4th say a prayer for all the girls who ve learned to stand up 5th say a prayer for all the boys who won t surrender sometimes i just want to drive until the streets run out i want to burn until there s nothing left to burn about this city s waiting for a better day when i get back there will be hell to pay if i m the only one left standing i will not be afraid to fight so i m breaking out of here tonight i feel a fever coming on me burning out of control and i hear nothing but the static for years now there s been nothing but the static on the radio

electric rail for almost an hour the outskirts a place to which men now rarely ventured the dark streets flickered under failing street lamps away from the machines away from the people trying to keep him silent he should be feeling free he wasn t he was feeling something else a wariness a hesitation joe let off the throttle as his father s bike slowed to a crawl he understood that feeling he d had ever since he d decided to leave the city that hesitation he d felt was the knowledge that he was being watched watched when he kissed the girl at the bar goodbye watched when he left his mother s house watched even now miles from the heart of the city a face in the shadows he stopped the bike in the middle of the street silenced the engine and lowered the kickstand there was no traffic no metal footsteps patrolling the streets but the familiar sound of the telescreens reached even here joe stood watching the face on the screen it babbled incessantly but said nothing over the sound of the screen joe heard footsteps slow and deliberate echoing from the darkness of the alleyway kneeling down joe placed one hand on the street beside him the other reached for the knife in his boot he recalled the stories the children of the city loved to repeat about the red eyed assassin light s monster they called it the footsteps emerged from the darkness of the alley and into the uneven glow of the flickering street lights joe stood his hand loosening its grip on the knife it was a gray haired man joe was about to speak when the old man lifted a finger and pointed past him into the
