listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill next the stranded senate of the white brick house with flowers asked some questions for their story all feeling now he took his bow and left the stage of time with no answers to no questions lonely paperbacks that wanted just a taste of feeling to implode them before living tiptoed to that wooden sign that said now take your place in line for happy this is lovely  listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill one secondary smile to go that extra mile to make me feel today to make it go away the chemistry is gone taken for a ride far away from you no longer left inside the actor with his world renown was thinking bout his last real day of silence was it over or is it just we all think that our answer isn t real it s just a picture of a letter bumble mumble make the rounds no matter what you ll seem profound it s useless just to worry something normal happens somewhere far away in clouds so please stop thinking this is happy listening to painted whispered light on top forgotten hill one secondary smile to go that extra mile to make me feel today to make it go away the chemistry is gone taken for a ride far away from you no longer left inside one secondary smile to go that extra mile to make me feel today to make it go away the chemistry is gone taken for a ride far away from you no longer left inside

his drink jimmy bean his chaser a beer after that various alcohols that s when the beatings get so severe asleep i pray he falls but don t feel sorry for me things weren t always this bad why when i was a young talking goat the old man was just like my dad i come from the hills of europe that s where i met the old man he was lost in the woods i gave him directions he gave me a tuna can then he stopped in his tracks and he said hey goat would you like to live with me i ve got a house with a pick up truck in a place across the sea i said sure why not i ve got no family you seem like a nice guy so we went off to america the home of apple pie on the boat the old man told me i would be a present for his wife a talking goat he exclaimed she d never seen this in her life i felt so special well i just couldn t believe it after all these years i finally had a friend he trimmed my beard he scraped my hooves i prayed it would never end but when we got to his house there was no wife only a short short letter it said i m leaving you for your brother because he fucks me better his eyes filled with tears of sadness his heart was filled with grief to soothe himself he drank a pint of old granddad and beat me like a side of beef i screamed send me back to the hills of europe he just shook his head and said nope no one will ever leave me again to make sure put on this 3 foot fucking rope present day i ve been on the truck for 51 years my only friend is the am radio sometimes the neighborhood children stop by but it s always rocks and beer bottles that they throw at first they re excited to see a talking goat they gather around to hear what i have to say but i guess sometimes my stories go on too long so they leave and giggle i need a bidet but you know there was a night that i did get off the truck when the old man was passed out drunk three neighborhood kids took me to a rock n roll concert the kind of music old school funk it was the first time i got off the truck the music made me lose control the lead singer asked if we were having fun i said fucking crank that rock n roll the women at the show were beautiful as they danced sexily on the soft grass one of them even petted my fur fuck me in the goat ass then some long haired guys grabbed me by the horns and threw me in the mosh pit they passed me around and treated me nice till i nerviously sprayed them with shit then the music stopped and everything was quite and all the rock n rollers started a fucking goat riot kill the goat kill the goat kill the goat kill the goat they chased me under the bleachers they chased me onto the street they chased me into an alley and said i was a dead fucking goat meat but then i saw a sight that i never thought i d see the old man swinging his hickory stick but he wasn t swinging at me fuck you pot smoking turkeys don t you press your luck the long hairs ran away screaming as i scrambled onto the truck when we got home the old man said goat you broke the sacred law no please sorry shit i ll let it go this time but if you leave again i ll break your fucking jaw super great okay thank you old man for saving my life thank you again and again you could have let them barbeque me but you acted like a friend i m not your friend i don t even like you i m just not drunk he said to prove his point he drank a bottle of grain alcohol and beat the fucking shit out of my head that night a suffered a concusion deep inside my goat brain i still cannot feel my tailbone and ill probaby never walk straight again i guess you d call me a scapegoat a punching bag for the old man to mock just because his wife left him for his brother s abnormally large cock he could have been my buddy but instead he s a crazy old fuck and once again i go to sleep in my eternal home the

but what does it really mean i believe the word is solely defined by whom you ask by definition of enlightened is an individual who can control his or her thoughts i m going to share with you a method i designed years ago on my path to enlightenment you ll learn how i became the ring leader of the circus in my mind but before we get into that i must be blatantly clear i was not always living in a state of constant positivity in fact for 18 years of my life i was an extremely stubborn person known for having one hell of a bad temper as a child i spent a lot of time on my own the first portion of my life i grew up in the rural countryside of corcoran minnesota i really can t imagine a more rounded place to be raised in than minnesota growing up there i got a taste of every season at 6 30am on a cold winter morning the last thing anyone wants to do is go stand at the bus stop but we had to and furthermore we had to learn how to enjoy it we lived on a 3 acre farm house with no neighbours in sight the only people i knew that existed were my mom dad and sister my mother was a wholesome lady born and raised in the midwest my father a motorcycle riding rebel without a cause the thought of the two of them being together was something like a blizzard in july they were young and in love but my father turned out to be more unfaithful than a gas tank on e and one day he ran out not just from his wife but from his children as well they got divorced and from this point on a woman would teach me how to be a man during the ages 5 to 10 i did a lot of moving around with my mom and sister i didn t know it then but we were jumping from city to city simply to survive at the time of the divorce my mom was working in the warehouse in my dad s trucking company when the marriage ended so did her pay checks not only that but my father was doing anything he could think of to avoid paying child support she now had 2 kids no money no job no house and no partner mom was standing toe to toe with the biggest challenge of her life and refused to blink i ll never forget receiving care packages from my grandparents and eating oranges for breakfast lunch and dinner this all just added fuel to the fire she became for determined than ever to provide for her family and change our current circumstances the only thing to follow a problem is a solution eventually mom landed a great job and we relocated to bloomington minnesota this environment was very different than what i had been used to it s a very populated suburb that sits just south of minneapolis it was built off interactions and relationships with others which i had absolutely no skills at assuming it would be easy for me to make friends mom recommended i sign up for some sports at school so i began playing hockey lacrosse baseball and golf instantly i found myself surrounded by peers but instead of making friends i made them my competition at this point growing up without a father figure in my life began to affect me during practices and games i d look around and see my teammates fathers cheering them on and in some cases even coaching the team i started to realize my family situation wasn t exactly normal or similar to most of theirs since i spent so much time by myself i never learned how to take a loss i had to be the best and needed to impress and outshine others i was very hard on myself and in turn would allow these emotions to boil up until i lashed out in fits of anger episodes like this would follow me for many years at one point in school my math teacher even recommended to my mom that i get tested for bipolar disorder i wasn t in control of my emotions they were being controlled by my thoughts i was very confused and determined to fix this so i took matters into my own hands here s what i came up with inside my head sits a dresser you know the kind of dresser you keep you clothes in with top middle and bottom drawers anytime a negative or undesired thought enters my head i immediately place it in the bottom drawer and slam it shut then i open my top drawer and allow the thought erasing to begin thats where i keep all the things that can instantaneously make me happy it s like how a certain smell can trigger a memory or how a song can magically bring you back to a place and time we all have memories with past feeling that make us happy the goal is to place these memories in your top drawer the moment i open up my top drawer vibrant colours explode into the air illuminating music notes birds paintings palm trees oceans and many other beautiful sites i ve captured while travelling the world within 1 second you could completely erase any negative thoughts by simply thinking about things that make you happy the ability to let go of memories is one of the most powerful tools we possess i can honestly forget about the initial negative thought immediately and you can too over the years plenty people have told me they think i have a bad memory but these people don t understand is that i have a selective memory i choose what i want to remember if i decide to remember something i ll be able to tell you everything about that memory until my dying day chapter 4 i m selfish i really like me to say that you re dreaming right now would essentially mean no one else exists without your effort it s saying that you re solely responsible for creating everything in your life that without you the world would not exist that s exactly how you re supposed to feel i m at the top of my list and i m not afraid to admit it i m not the least bit ashamed and you shouldn t be either the word selfish has been abused and misused since its origin for some reason we ve attached a negative connotation to this misunderstood word i m here to restore it s dignity by no means am i saying you shouldn t help out others in need because in my opinion there s nothing more gratifying than being told thank you what i m saying is until you ve helped yourself you re not helping anyone else this is your life and it s time to start focussing on you the first song of mine that really caught people s attention was called no girlfriend from the outside looking in it sounds like a typical rap song about being promiscuous with a bunch of girls and not being faithful with one in particular let s take a closer look i ve always had an addictive personality to things i feel strongly about whatever caught my attention at the time i would submerge myself in it when i first saw travis barker play drums i picked up drum sticks and studied every blink 182 song when i first saw danny way air out of a half pipe i skated everyday until my shoes had no soles when i first heard eyedea freestyle i started to rhyme the same went for when i had feelings for someone the person wouldn t leave my mind for a second and if i didn t know what they were doing at all times it would drive me mad then came no girlfriend i used to record in my moms garage in bloomington one night just as i was about to shut down the computer i was hit hard with a moment of clarity i suddenly realized how significant it was to have yourself on point before you offer half of your time to someone else from here on out i wanted to spent 100 of my time focussed on me i m a very career driven individual when i understood this everything began to click i would become successful in every aspect of what i was pursuing before entering another relationship i m not saying you should push people away and become a loner what i m saying is you have the choice to spend the maximum amount of time focussed on you goals it s you call but the choice you make will be the deciding factor in how long it takes for you to get what you want the more time you spend thinking about what you want the faster you will get it i was so inspired by this wake up call that i had to immediately start writing the second i put my pen to that page it didn t stop moving until the song was completed the first sentence on that page was no girlfriend until i make a million the reference to making a million doesn t have anything to do with money rather it symbolizes a form of success in the general public s eyes within one our the song was written and recorded inside moms garage it s my right to become successful and take advantage of the years i ve been given every dream you want to pursue is waiting for you to introduce yourself now is the time to say hello the time to hesitate has passed i ve always found it interesting that you could walk into any establishment and see one thing about the employees ages old and young people all work under the same roof you could go into any fast food restaurant and notice just as many people under 40 as you do over 40 the older people are able to maintain a living and pay whatever bills they may have off the same jobs you can get as a 16 year old spend your years chasing true ambitions you re never too old and it s never to late to dive head

tossed around by fate like on an unexpected date with a stranger who might talk too fast or ask me questions about myself before i ve decided that he can ask me questions about myself he might sit too close or call the waiter by his first name or eat oreos but eat the cookie before the cream but what scares me the most what scares me the most is what if when he sees me what if he doesn t like it what if he runs the other way and i can t hide from it what happens then if when he knows me he s only disappointed what if i give myself away to only get it given back i couldn t live with that so i m just fine inside my shell shaped mind this way i get the best view so when he sees me i want him to i m not defensive i m simply being cautious i can t risk reckless dating due to my miscalculating why a certain suitor stands in line i ve seen in movies most made for television you cannot be too careful when it comes to sharing your life i could end up a miserable wife he could be criminal some sort of psychopath who escaped from an institution somewhere where they don t have girls he could have masterminded some way to find me he could be color blind how untrustworthy is that he could be less than kind or even worse he could be very nice have lovely eyes and make me laugh come out of hiding what do i do with that oh god  what if when he sees me i like him and he knows it what if he opens up a door and i can t close it what happens then if when he holds me my heart is set in motion i m not prepared for that i m scared of breaking open but still i can t help from hoping to find someone to talk to who likes the way i am someone who when he sees me wants to again1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"with december comes the glimmer on her face and i get a bit nervous i get a bit

of el paso out to the badlands of new mexico  back in el paso my life would be worthless everything s gone in life nothing is left it s been so long since i ve seen the young maiden my love is stronger than my fear of death i saddled up and away i did go riding alone in the dark maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me tonight nothing s worse than this pain in my heart and at last here i am on the hill overlooking el paso i can see rosa s cantina below my love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to feleena i go off to my right i see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more shouting and shooting i can t let them catch me i have to make it to rosa s back door something is dreadfully wrong for i feel a deep burning pain in my side though i am trying to stay in the saddle i m getting weary unable to ride but my love for feleena is strong and i rise where i ve fallen though i am weary i can t stop to rest i see the white puff of smoke from the rifle i feel

with my hero george w bush to be this close to the man i feel like i m dreaming somebody pinch me you know what i m a pretty sound sleeper that may not be enough somebody shoot me in the face is he really not here tonight dammit the one guy who could have helped by the way before i get started if anybody needs anything else at their tables just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers somebody from the nsa will be right over with a cocktail mark smith ladies and gentlemen of the press corps madame first lady mr president my name is stephen colbert and tonight it s my privilege to celebrate this president we re not so different he and i we get it we re not brainiacs on the nerd patrol we re not members of the factinista we go straight from the gut right sir that s where the truth lies right down here in the gut do you know you have more nerve endings in your gut than you have in your head you can look it up i know some of you are going to say i did look it up and that s not true that s cause you looked it up in a book next time look it up in your gut i did my gut tells me that s how our nervous system works every night on my show the colbert report i speak straight from the gut ok i give people the truth unfiltered by rational argument i call it the no fact zone fox news i hold a copyright on that term i m a simple man with a simple mind i hold a simple set of beliefs that i live by number one i believe in america i believe it exists my gut tells me i live there i feel that it extends from the atlantic to the pacific and i strongly believe it has 50 states and i cannot wait to see how the washington post spins that one tomorrow i believe in democracy i believe democracy is our greatest export at least until china figures out a way to stamp it out of plastic for three cents a unit in fact ambassador zhou wenzhong welcome your great country makes our happy meals possible i said it s a celebration i believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least and by these standards we have set up a fabulous government in iraq i believe in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps i believe it is possible i saw this guy do it once in cirque du soleil it was magical and though i am a committed christian i believe that everyone has the right to their own religion be you hindu jewish or muslim i believe there are infinite paths to accepting jesus christ as your personal savior ladies and gentlemen i believe it s yogurt but i refuse to believe it s not butter most of all i believe in this president now i know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32 approval rating but guys like us we don t pay attention to the polls we know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in reality and reality has a well known liberal bias so mr president please pay no attention to the people that say the glass is half full 32 means the glass it s important to set up your jokes properly sir sir pay no attention to the people who say the glass is half empty because 32 means it s 2 3 empty there s still some liquid in that glass is my point but i wouldn t drink it the last third is usually backwash okay look folks my point is that i don t believe this is a low point in this presidency i believe it is just a lull before a comeback i mean it s like the movie rocky all right the president in this case is rocky balboa and apollo creed is everything else in the world it s the tenth round he s bloodied his corner man mick who in this case i guess would be the vice president he s yelling cut me dick cut me and every time he falls everyone says stay down stay down does he stay down no like rocky he gets back up and in the end he actually he loses in the first movie ok doesn t matter the point is it is the heart warming story of a man who was repeatedly punched in the face so don t pay attention to the approval ratings that say 68 of americans disapprove of the job this man is doing i ask you this does that not also logically mean that 68 approve of the job he s not doing think about it i haven t i stand by this man i stand by this man because he stands for things not only for things he stands on things things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares and that sends a strong message that no matter what happens to america she will always rebound with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world now there may be an energy crisis this president has a very forward thinking energy policy why do you think he s down on the ranch cutting that brush all the time he s trying to create an alternative energy source by 2008 we will have a mesquite powered car and i just like the guy he s a good joe obviously loves his wife calls her his better half and polls show america agrees she s a true lady and a wonderful woman but i just have one beef ma am i m sorry but this reading initiative i m sorry i ve never been a fan of books i don t trust them they re all fact no heart i mean they re elitist telling us what is or isn t true or what did or didn t happen who s britannica to tell me the panama canal was built in 1914 if i want to say it was built in 1941 that s my right as an american i m with the president let history decide what did or did not happen the greatest thing about this man is he s steady you know where he stands he believes the same thing wednesday that he believed on monday no matter what happened tuesday events can change this man s beliefs never will as excited as i am to be here with the president i am appalled to be surrounded by the liberal media that is destroying america with the exception of fox news fox news gives you both sides of every story the president s side and the vice president s side but the rest of you what are you thinking reporting on nsa wiretapping or secret prisons in eastern europe those things are secret for a very important reason they re super depressing and if that s your goal well misery accomplished over the last five years you people were so good over tax cuts wmd intelligence the effect of global warming we americans didn t want to know and you had the courtesy not to try to find out those were good times as far as we knew but listen let s review the rules here s how it works the president makes decisions he s the decider the press secretary announces those decisions and you people of the press type those decisions down make announce type just put em through a spell check and go home get to know your family again make love to your wife write that novel you got kicking around in your head you know the one about the intrepid washington reporter with the courage to stand up to the administration you know fiction because really what incentive do these people have to answer your questions after all i mean nothing satisfies you everybody asks for personnel changes so the white house has personnel changes then you write oh they re just rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic first of all that is a terrible metaphor this administration is not sinking this administration is soaring if anything they are rearranging the deck chairs on the hindenburg now it s not all bad guys out there some are heroes christopher buckley jeff sacks ken burns bob schieffer they ve all been on my show by the way mr president thank you for

jackson is here the reverend haven t heard from the reverend in a little while i had him on the show very interesting and challenging interview you can ask him anything but he s going to say what he
