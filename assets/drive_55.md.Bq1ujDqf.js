peter and the wolf each character in the tale is going to be represented by a different instrument of the orchestra for instance the bird will be played by the flute here s the duck played by the oboe the cat by the clarinet the bassoon will represent grandfather the wolf by the french horns and peter by the strings the blast of the hunters shotguns played by the kettle drums are you sitting comfortably then i shall begin early one morning peter opened the gate and went out into the big green meadow on a branch of a big tree sat a little bird peter s friend all is quiet all is quiet chirped the bird gaily yes all is quiet just then a duck came waddling round she was glad that peter hadn t closed the gate and decided to take a nice swim in the deep pond in the meadow seeing the duck the little bird flew down upon on the grass settled next to her and shrugged his shoulders what kind of bird are you if you can t fly said he to this the duck replied what kind of bird are you if you can t swim and dived into the pond they argued and argued the duck swimming in the pond and the little bird hopping along the shore suddenly something caught peter s attention it was a cat crawling through the grass the cat thought the bird is busy arguing i ll just grab him stealthily she crept towards him on his velvet paws look out shouted peter and the bird immediately flew up into the tree while the duck quacked at the cat from the middle of the pond the cat walked around the tree and thought is it worth climbing up so high by the time i get there the bird will have flown away just then grandfather came out he was angry because peter had gone in the meadow it is the dangerous place if a wolf should come out of the forest then what would you do but peter paid no attention to his grandfather s words boys like peter aren t afraid of wolves but grandfather took peter by the hand locked the gate and led him home no sooner had peter gone than a big gray wolf came out of the forest in a twinkling the cat climbed up into the tree the duck quacked and in her excitement jumped out of the pond but no matter how hard the duck tried to run she couldn t escape the wolf he was getting nearer nearer catching up with her then he got her and with one gulp swallowed her and now this is how things stood the cat was sitting on one branch the bird on another not too close to the cat and the wolf walked round and round the tree looking at them with hungry eyes in the meantime peter without the slightest fear stood behind the gate watching all that was going on he ran home got a strong rope and climbed up the high stone wall one of the branches of the tree around which the wolf was walking stretched out over the wall grabbing hold of the branch peter lightly climbed over on to the tree peter said to the bird fly down and circle over the wolf s head only take care that he doesn t catch you the bird almost touched the wolf s head with his wings while the wolf snapped angrily at him this side and that how that bird teased the wolf and how the wolf wanted to catch him but the bird was clever and the wolf simply couldn t do anything about it meanwhile peter made a lasso and carefully letting it down and down and down caught the wolf by the tail and pulled with all his might feeling himself caught the wolf began to jump wildly trying to get loose but peter tied the other end of rope to the tree and the wolf s jumping only made the rope round his tail tighter just then the hunters came out of the woods following the wolf s trail and shooting as they went but peter sitting in the tree said don t shoot birdie and i have already caught the wolf now help us take him to the zoo now just imagine just imagine the triumphant procession peter at the head after him the hunters leading the wolf and winding up the whole procession grandfather and the cat grandfather shook his head discontentedly well if peter hadn t caught the wolf what then above them flew birdie chirping merrily my what brave fellows we are peter and i look what we have caught and if one would listen very carefully he would hear the duck quacking inside the wolf because the wolf in his hurry

feel so dumb the bastard doesn t care that my poor ass is getting numb how can you say that how can you say that it s easy i can say it cause it s absolutely true don t be a penis the man is a genius

little man why is it a problem to admit that i m a fan cause he s a hack with a knack for stealing anything he can how can you say that how can you say that the man really knows how to write a bitchin play you wish you could pen one we wish we were in one i just wish that he would go away well that s not gonna happen because everybody i know says that he is the greatest writer that england has ever known and that s another thing i hate about shakespeare is all the twits who bloviate about shakespeare and how they prattle on about his great accomplishments well la di da di da and once they start the gushing there s no stopping them and then it s blah blah blah blah blah shakespeare and he walks in it s dum de dum ta da shakespeare he s holding court and they say will you re such a genius and your writing is divine a rose by any other name is such a clever line and they re all ooh and he s all stop and they re all yay and i m all retch and i m really getting sick of it and oh oh oh oh i hate shakespeare i think by now we sort of know you hate shakespeare shmakespeare the way he feigns humility when all he does is gloat the way he wears that silly frilly collar round his throat the

try to prove him wrong and every time i write a song i reminisce about the pain that i m repressing in my brain so i don t have to feel alone and i ve been living with depression so i wonder how this shit really begins i m comfortable with the thoughts of vision and now it is i ve been working on this record for a minute still i feel like nothing that i do is good enough my insecurities are creeping in so they would seep in to the music ain t it funny when other people see your pain as amusing abusing many a pill and numbing the way i feel til the point of my reality s the furthest thing from real the only thing i ever needed was a little piece of love and i couldn t find that in people so i would seek it in drugs and i wanted to be the greatest instead i m facing the truth but the fact of the matter is that i m losing it what s the use and i know i m sounding repetitive lack the lust for living i pray that i be forgiven i say let s take a picture for sinners to get the sentiment a critical acclaim to explaining it wasn t evident a premonition of my early death i ll make it prevalent malevolent confessing and if i was down and out i can t sell my soul to be relevant gallivanting around like fuck i m finally free i m ignoring all of my problems i said i d bury them deep but i m actually terrified and my paranoia was verified cause i just realized i don t wanna make it to twenty five a suicidal psychopath a schizophrenic kinda guy that s looking for your empathy hoping that you ll remember me the message i provided collided within the melody a metamorphosism reliving giving debauchery the resurrection of a savior coming out of nazareth where you could catch a laceration and a crucifixion under what condition d you make the decision moving like it s in a mild position living at the bottom wishing i was with it couldn t tell the difference so tired of giving the false opinions my faith in the book that was written by other people they probably wrote with agendas so every role was intended for anyone to follow attention i got a testament just like the book of mark and i m sparking a revolution my story a revelation amazing i d rather save it debate it everything on my mind while i was taking a mental picture ok so my train of thought is evasive i m faded within my memory from a daily addiction of always staying sedated and claiming i wanna make it i m nothing more than a follower no apologies for it enforcing my fucking happiness don t know what i believe and i m seething and barely breathing i was thinking of positivity the possibility that i ll be sane is like a fallacy i got a way to go and i m showing you people gradually i been imagining a better life and then i contradict it the consequence of feeling like a loser with no confidence and i ve been all alone i m tryna find the source of inner peace i suffocate the beat until the flow has been consumed i strangulate that mother fucker turn the tune and turn the night maroon and if i m being honest i think i m losing my passion i m passing on opportunities giving in to distraction the problem s that i ve been having is all of it s a facade it s quantity over quality profit over the product but shit if it makes a dollar who gives a fuck if it s garbage we ll get it radio play and then now make it a classic and take a nigga with talent that s about as big as a grain of salt and put him on a pedestal he ll eventually catapult to perpetual force the actual result distracting they forgot that mother fucker was never decent at rapping they reminisce on the past and there ain t nobody original but niggas stealing styles and never giving their credit accepting that shit s pathetic a hypothetical pondering i put it on a paper for some people i m being honest with abolishing a novice and murdering his accomplice a complicated affair with the notorious hitter these habitual liars supplying a lot of ignorance it s all about an image so everyone s irresponsible and if you got a positive message then it s impossible to overcome the current plan and rap a better obstacle it s illogical to think that the future is looking brighter when money comes into play than the vision will get distorted cause you were forced into feeling by acting out of your character you lost your sense of pride that s inside don t that embarrass ya barely making it now when you re coming up from the rubble refuse to be in the rut ain t no need for an introduction my shit is really disgusting it s different and impeccable intelligent and highly respectable you re susceptible to this lyrical giant a tyrant acting defiant i d rather do this alone so mother fuck an alliance aligning with preservation to practice my dedication by defecating the delicate relegated with delegates to give them rigamortis supported within a deficit celebrated a reverence televising my decadence from years of destitution the resolution s irrelevant it s gotten to the point where i can see that nothing s real at all it s leaving me appalled and i m embarrassed i will get involved to mental regression for i have yet to evolve got to find a spot to put my aggression before i m gone but the pain that i feel has lasted so long so by the end of this song i m praying for my desire cause i m refusing to fake it i d rather reform than retire so my generation remedial i really can t believe this shit is happening in any lie i m surrounded by fucking geniuses and you gotta be kidding me the only thing i was meant to be is the dopest mother fucker that people will probably never see and if i never make it then i m fulfilling the prophecy everything that i write has been centered around my honesty24","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"people sayin all my new shit kill no shit well

ready for i think i m ready for it like i ve been thinkin about it i think i m ready i mean if i m being completely transparent with y all uh like my lifestyle hasn t really changed that much uh you know considering uh where i think i m at musically like i m still at the point right now where pretty much any bitch that tweets at me anything remotely flirtatious i have seen not just one of your pictures i have seen the entire catalog that s the type of shit that s goin down over here right now so i am definitely ready for that uh next step y know what i m sayin i think it s close too i think it s close like uh diddy tweeted about me uh y know that i don t know if he handles his own twitter i would assume he probably doesn t actually but like i m so confident that i feel as though like me and diddy will have a moment just about this outro like when we re both sittin next to each other smokin cigars and bein like ayy remember when you said that shit on that outro like and i m like yeah that s this is the exact moment i i did that for y know what i m sayin bring the bring the beat back up i don t know why like keep loop everything i wanna be talkin for minutes yeah uh y know what i m sayin like uh shout out my macbook pro had that shit since 09 i made my first song ever on it like when i called myself lil dicky i made my like fuckin album songs on that shit and we survived baby uh shoutout allen iverson larry david will smith and kobe bryant for makin me the man that i am today both on and off the court shout out my mother what a great woman she s so mad i recorded these

sell tmz pictures of my actual asshole heh y know cause well i i think that d be such a feat if i could actually create like an alt alias and sell tmz pictures of my own asshole like profit off of that that i would totally do it i don t know why seth rogen s not already doing it i don t i m seein the signs that it s not i m i think i m seein the signs i hope i am if i m really just misreading all these signs then i am 100 gonna have like a legitimate nervous breakdown uh at some point very soon so we ll find out about that but i see some signs like like i really am not fuckin that much but like the other day i did fuck a bitch to music like i fucked a bitch to some miguel and that s kind of new for me if i m bein real like i had never actually done it before but i was feelin like i was some king shit y know what i m sayin so i was like man imma fuck this bitch to some miguel right now uh actually to be completely real to you i i will never fuck a girl to music again i found the whole thing to feel like completely cliche like i don t need my emotions dictated to me by like music it makes me feel like i m in a tv scene takes all the like realness out of the moment for me like actually was actually super weirded out by it so but still like i am about to let my hair down and i don t know i just feel like it s all comin i feel like like i m literally like about to find out about everything and it s exciting and i y know i i had pinkeye last week and i remember thinkin that as i like was like real down cause i was like trying to keep recording and shit but i was thinking what would michael jordan do and he would play through the pinkeye so that s why i m in here i m still not fully recovered y know what i m sayin i i m definitely clearin up like it s totally on the upswing but i just want you know i did record this shit through pinkeye alright i could talk for fuckin years legitimate years this is an outro to an out you see how long i talk with outros to songs

there naked and bare but none of this stuff can cover us no it never was enough for us nothing we can work for to obtain can wash away the stain the only thing we re entitled to is judgement for the lives we led there s nothing we can hide behind in the end we need grace instead we spend a lifetime trying to find love in anything and everything this life has to offer it s true and often times we trade the temporal satisfaction for the things the genuine believer is entitled to i m convinced that it s because they don t understand that there exists an order of benefits of redemption that s applied to his bride and the basis of his choice in election was for god alone to decide and it is not like an invitation that one might accept or reject but rather its the effectual calling drawing to himself his elect regenerating and enabling us to respond in faith toward christ giving us the gift of repentance and revealing the nature of his sacrifice binding us with a true intellectual realization of our sinful condition converting us and turning us from our previous malicious disposition ultimately leading to a legal declaration by god that we ve been made right in his sight justification being credited to us on the basis of the righteousness of christ adopted to be the children of god and grafted into fellowship being bound together by the blood of christ into a common membership sanctified by the spirit given gradual growth in holiness increasing in our thinking and behaving in a way that shows that were chosen and all the while being preserved and upheld according to his sovereign providence giving us confidence that he will carry us to completion just like he promised1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"take it easy love is hard walk among us come from god take it

disaster waiting to happen and the impact was greater than you could ever imagine so you planned to be more selective with your selections love less and be less affectionate but the fact is the minute

whether you believe it it s just a matter of whether you consider it compatible or problematic but if you honestly acknowledge the logical conclusion for you to choose your destiny is a delusion cuz when you examine the general system of living it proves who s your true master and who you re enslaved to and it s true that since the fall we ve all been taught a false view of freedom and a rebellious mind recoils and is inclined to deny him and bind him with the ties of treason either rebellion or righteousness both lead to the inescapable mark of eternal life or death bound to sin or bound to obey either way we re both slaves one kills one saves  we all we all surrender yeah we all either to death or for life in the lord we all we all surrender like slaves we all but sin is death he is life oh we all we all we all we all dear descendants of adam and eve we ve been contaminated with a disease the infiltration of sin is deep in our nature peel back the layers it s no secret even the naked eye can see it under careful examination no exaggeration needed these are exact statements we are dead in our offenses we can t pay penance with petty possessions no exceptions or exemptions will be made nothing independent of true repentance and redemption deserving the death sentence we earned it by our own merits inherited from our parents pride and arrogance endlessly in error is the best way to describe our rebellious lives as blind derelicts on what basis should we escape judgement and condemnation if we get graded on a curve who is worthy of god s favor if he is righteous and just and the wages of sin is death the only way for us to live is if someone perfect dies for us how else can the spiritually lifeless rise from dust from the worst to the least of sinners the truth hurts but let it simmer until your soul surrenders control the goal of faith is to believe that we need to be saved and then rejoice knowing that our savior came died in our place and his sinless life was raised from the grave our sin is death christ is life either way all of us are slaves one kills one saves1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"anchor of my soul you sustain when i m in the storm you

alone a tragic event i must admit but let s not be overblown i m not trying to write a love song just a sad pathetic moan maybe i just need a change maybe i just need a new cologne now i look at love like being stabbed in the heart you torture each other from day to day and then one day you part most of the time it s misery but there s some joy at the start oh for that i d say it s worth it just use a blade that s short and sharp on me and if love is just a game then how come it s no fun if love is just a game how come i ve never won i guess maybe it s possible i might be playing it wrong and
