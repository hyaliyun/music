junk house in south carolina held a boy the age of ten along with his older brother billy and a mother and her boyfriend who was a triple loser with some blue tattoos that were given to him when he was young and a drunk temper that was easy to lose and thank god he didn t own a gun well billy woke up in the back of his truck took a minute to open his eyes he took a peep into the back of the house and found himself a big surprise he didn t see his brother but there was his mother with her red headed head in her hands while the boyfriend had his gloves wrapped around an old priest trying to choke the man billy looked up from the window to the truck threw up and had to struggle to stand he saw that red necked bastard with a hammer turn the priest into a shell of a man the priest was putting up the fight of his life but he was old and he was bound to lose the boyfriend hit as hard as he could and knocked the priest right down to his shoes well now billy knew but never actually met the preacher lying there in the room he heard himself say that must be my daddy then he knew what he was gonna do billy got up enough courage took it up and grabbed the first blunt thing he could find it was a cold glass bottle of milk that got delivered every morning at nine billy broke in and saw the blood on the floor and he turned around and put the lock on the door he looked dead into the boyfriend s eye his mother was a ghost too upset to cry then he took a step toward the man on the ground from his mouth trickled out a little audible sound he heard the boyfriend shout get out and billy said not till i know what this is all about well this preacher here was attacking your mama but billy knew just who was starting the drama so billy took dead aim at his face and smashed the bottle on the man who left his dad in disgrace and the white milk dripped down with the blood and the boyfriend fell down dead for good right next to the preacher who was gasping for air and billy shouted daddy why d you have to come back here his mama reached behind the sugar and honey and pulled out an envelope filled with money your daddy gave us this she collapsed in tears he s been paying all the bills for years mama let s put this body underneath the trees and put daddy in the truck and head to tennessee just then his little brother came in holding the milk man s hat and a bottle of gin singing la la la la la la la la yeah la la la la la la la la yeah la la la la la la la la yeah la la la la la la well now you heard another side to the story but you wanna know how it ends if you

in the dark star of night my veins pulsed butter as it illuminated your thighs on the fourth day we felt compelled to whistle for how could we call the love birds to nestle and keep us company in this world anew and fresh today i paint to life a portrait of the sacred friend the perfect wife in synesthesia together we have filled the world with colored wine but the story nears the present time of restlessness and wake up calls wake up wake up years have flown fast but then who s counting the wars have been won but there s few left standing between us and the shadows of christmas past critically acclaimed but sadly underrated fortune definitely favored us but no one celebrated our wits were splitting at their ends we gazed upon the city lights we each laughed aloud one final time and agreed this is one thing we ll miss and as we held our breath and forced our will the minutes stopped the air was still and minds began to unlearn their faulted ways we blasted through the hills they were the first to go and the most painful so because we made them first when we learned to bleed with our fingers on the seeds that sowed in the dirt and then cried when we came in the glorious masterwork of life ending and beginning again we ignored the pleas of the forest and the seas as we scorched the earth with our tears we burned them in fear until there s nothing left nothing left
