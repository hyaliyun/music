horse broke his back and left me here and how was i supposed to know and god won t forgive me and you won t forgive me not unless i open up my heart and how am i supposed to do that when i go to this same room every night and sleep in the same bed every night the same fucking bed with the red comforter with the white stripes and the yellow ceiling light that makes me feel like i m dying this sea is too familiar how many nights have i drowned here how many times have i drowned i give up i give up let us take you back to where we came in we were united an undivided nation we got divided it was something inside us and it was not us we were so naive we were just like animals told what to believe by the beasts who took control we wanted control too but that was normal cause our life was one of survival the decisions we ve made if you can call it deciding with your life on the line it d be social suicide to change your mind so we got mad and we split the scene now we download all of our shit for free it s the new economy we have nothing to offer and we sleep on trash i give up i give up let us take you back to where you came in a man clinging to the cliff of revelation so scared of what he would find he started crying it was not me stopped at the borderline they stripped his disguise so he read a book that won a pulitzer prize it was about death it didn t help he saw himself in it and he was disturbed at the conclusions that it led to but he couldn t say what because the author was dead too and so though he made fun of us he has now become one of us i give up i give up i give up i give up i give up i give up i give up and you wake up trembling from a dream where i swam into the river i reach out and hold you in my arms i love you i love you i love you29","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"too cool can t lose we mobbin we mobbin pull up to the function no roof reall here tryna smokin loud grandad bouncers know the deal we just walkin straight through

start to whine and i knew that left rear tire was about to go well the spare was flat and i got uptight cause there wasn t a filling station in sight so i just limped on down the shoulder on the rim i went as far as i could and when i stopped the car it was right in front of this little bar kind of a redneck lookin joint called the dew drop inn well i stuffed my hair up under my hat and told the bartender that i had a flat and would he be kind enough to give me change for a one there was one thing i was sure proud to see there wasn t a soul in the place except for him and me he just looked disgusted and pointed toward the telephone i called up a station down the road a ways and he said he wasn t very busy today and he could have someone there in just about 10 minutes or so he said now you just stay right where yer at and i didn t bother to tell the darn fool that i sure as hell didn t have anyplace else to go i just ordered up a beer and sat down at the bar when some guy walked in and said who owns this car with the peace sign and the mag wheels and four on the floor well he looked at me and i damn near died and i decided that i d just wait outside so i laid a dollar on the bar and headed for the door just when i thought i d get out of there with my skin these five big dudes come strollin in with this one old drunk chick and some fella with green teeth and i was almost to the door when the biggest one said you tip your hat to this lady son and when i did all that hair fell out from underneath now the last thing i wanted was to get into a fight in jackson mississippi on a saturday night especially when there was three of them and only one of me but they all started laughing and i felt kinda sick and i knew i better think of something pretty quick so i just reached out and kicked ol green teeth right in the knee now he let out a yell that d curl your hair but before he could move i grabbed me a chair and said watch him folks cause he s a thoroughly dangerous man you may not know it but this man is a spy he s a undercover agent for the fbi and he s been sent down here to infiltrate the ku klux klan he was still bent over holding on to his knee but everybody else was looking and listening to me and i laid it on thicker and heavier as i went i said would you believe this man has gone as far as tearing wallace stickers off the bumpers of cars and he voted for george mcgovern for president well he s a friend of them long haired hippy type pinko fags i bet you he s even got a commie flag tacked up on the wall inside of his garage he s a snake in the grass i tell you guys he may look dumb but that s just a disguise he s a mastermind in the ways of espionage they all started looking real suspicious at him and he jumped up and said now just wait a minute jim you know he s lying i been living here all of my life i m a faithful follower of brother john birch and i belong to the antioch baptist church and i ain t even got a garage you can call home and ask my wife then he started saying something bout the way i was dressed but i didn t wait around to hear the rest i was too busy moving and hoping i didn t run out of luck and when i hit the

all out there stepping and fetching like their heads were on fire and their asses was catching but i figured i had better go ahead and split before the cops got there when i hit the road i was really

rides a mount but nothing really matters much it s doom alone that counts the one eyed undertaker he blows his futile horn come in she said i ll give you shelter from the storm i ve heard newborn babies wailin like a mournin dove and old men with their broken teeth stranded without love do i understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn come in she said i ll give you shelter from the
