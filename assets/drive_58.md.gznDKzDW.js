with a dirt road leading to a covered bridge where earlier we d scurried off to check the cart the horse had drawn for fuses and more powder for the fourth and in the nighttime when the first of them is lit we will sneak back there in darkness just to kiss and i ll panic at your image as the flashes split the rafter gaps terrified you ll see my open eyelids and this is what i do now every night try to somehow catch you in the light when summer goes the leaves shift tone then float as the canopy reverts to branch and bone downward tumbling inadvertently i stumble and you steady me i twirl you one quick circle make your ankles show then we laugh so hard we can no longer stand and you look me in the eyes and take my hands on the forest floor it s warmer than my bed has ever been before curled up tight together like an ampersand this is what i do now all alone count the many things that make you home and when the snow falls we will wrap ourselves in furs lie beside the stove and stoke the fire make the embers roar a little more snowdrifts up the cabin door you glow and we speak slowly growing tired so let the winter freeze each corner of the earth bury everything i ve had in

always remember if you could see it up close how could you ever forget how senseless death how precious life i wanna be there when the bullet hit and the crowd poured out as the shots drowned into siren sounds out of their houses now and over front yards all the way up to the place where the police tape ran to mark the crime scene everybody trying to catch a glimpse of what was happening of what was going on between the ambulance and all the cop cars everybody gossiping whose kid got hit where d it hit him and who could ve fired it everybody wondering how did it happen again and is he dead these children our kids everybody wondering how far they were from where the victims live and i visit them their houses inside my dream i visit them my spirit soaring high and high up over king park leaves the crime scene travels further back til far before the shooting through their windows to their living rooms i see them younger this time playing games and doing homework all these marks of youth soon transformed coldly into stone for fights and stupid feuds for ruins wrapped in gold and cruelly i recall why i have come to find a reason but there cannot be a reason not for death not like this not like this three days later they made funeral plans the family three days later a mother had to bury her son not far away the shooter holed up in a hotel near to the highway with a friend and the gun that same gun he d fled immediately but was identified by witnesses his picture on tv only 20 years old they called him grandpa he was older than the others by a year maybe two and he was safe for awhile until somebody saw him there and notified the authorities who surrounded the hotel first arresting an accomplice while attempting to flee then chasing him up the staircase to the floor where he d stayed he closed the door hard behind him locked himself in the room they could ve kicked in the door but knew the gun was still with him one he d already used and so they feared what he d do i floated up through the window of a room to the west i hovered out to the hallway tried to listen in i heard them trying to reason get him to open the door his uncle begging and pleading half collapsed to the floor he preached of hope and forgiveness said there is always a chance to rectify what you ve taken make your peace in the world i thought to slip through the door i could ve entered the room i felt the burden of murder it shook the earth to the core felt like the world was collapsing then we heard him speak can i still get into heaven if i kill myself can i still get into heaven if i kill myself can i ever be forgiven cause i killed that kid it was an accident i swear it wasn t meant for him and if i turn it on me if i even it out can i still get in or will they send me to

turned my collar to the cold and damp when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touched the sound of silence and in the naked light i saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared disturb the sound of silence fools said i you do not know
