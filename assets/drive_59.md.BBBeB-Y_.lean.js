it s honestly futile if i don t utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry looking at me like it s lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i m on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin to censor you like that one line i said on i m back from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i ll take seven kids from columbine put em all in a line add an ak 47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain t as big as i was but i m morphin into an immortal comin through the portal you re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i don t know what the fuck that you rhyme for you re pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad

of rubber so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it ll glue to you and i m devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin audience a feelin like it s levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they ll be celebrating cause i know the way to get em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he s too mainstream well that s what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it s not hip hop it s pop cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make em lose it i don t know how to make songs like that i don t know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i m rippin any one of these verses that versus you it s curtains i m inadvertently hurtin you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins to ungh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i m a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it s still tongue in cheek fuck you i m drunk so satan take the fuckin wheel i m asleep in the front seat bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there s something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here s what they want from me they re asking me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life s handin you lemons make lemonade then but if i can t batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don t mistake him for satan it s a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don t be a

gestures and your constant support over the years i also need to share with you a few words about my son please take a few moments and listen i hope you gain something from it thanks as a child christopher was outspoken when it suited him at times he was quiet and of course he was mischievous as all little boys are as a young man he liked to do everything he liked to read he liked to be with his friends as young kids or young boys he enjoyed life everything that would make him happy or comfortable he would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family his early inspirations toward rap music were the ll s of the world the sugar hills the mr magics and the fat boys of the rap channel those were all the things i heard in the house even though i called it noise and banging i know now it is a accepted musical art form i was a single parent i raised my son on my own his father had no influence on his decision towards the musical outlet or career he chose my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around he would have turned to rap he loved music he loved rap at a point in my son s life he developed paranoia about death and about the dying we are living in a world of imperfect human beings where greed jealousy and envy are manifested by what others have accomplished in life my son was very very much aware of that he appreciated his station in life on the directions in which he was going or traveling on the other hand there were others who i should use the hip hop phrase player hating and i think that is what resulted in his paranoia if i had to change anything in my son s life that would have allowed him to be here today i would have deterred him from a career in music i m aware that millions appreciate his music millions loved his music be that it may if he hadn t chosen that lifestyle that career my son would be alive today if i could sum up christopher in one word the word would be generous the thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that he was in a position to help position to share position to give to others who needed to others who wanted to others appreciated the gifts that he gave2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"what

quite a big family and we weren t very rich sometimes we lived from day to day but one thing we did do was go to church every sunday mama took us to church and i was in the choir too hey yeah i sang a little bit in sunday school she taught us the golden rules the 10 commandments and she said son do onto others as you have them do onto you she said don t steal don t rob you know all the things good parents try to instil into their children well you know i did a few little things like shoot hook i guess every kid shoots hooky at least once and umm she said stay out of trouble you know when i was a teenager i didn t break in burglarize or rob anybody i tried to work for what i got you know tried to be honest didn t commit no crimes or nothing but you know i had to wait huh til i reached manhood to commit a crime according to the court of love if there is such a court but you know sometimes you re forced into things like this see sometimes cupid can shoot his arrow so fast you can t
