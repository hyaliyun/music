ve ever had in my life alright this happened when i was eleven years old in chicago illinois where i grew up and it took place at a little restaurant called the salt and pepper diner which was a family restaurant in the city yes yes you know the salt and pepper diner it s a wonderful family restaurant in chicago which means that it caters mainly to teenagers and homeless schizophrenics now i go into this place one day when i m eleven with my best friend john now i should say that his name is also john i m not calling myself my own best friend it s a separate human being we walk into the salt and pepper diner one day and they had a jukebox there alright and the jukebox was three plays for a dollar so we put in seven dollars and selected twenty one plays of tom jones what s new pussycat and then we ordered and waited here s the thing about when what s new pussycat plays over and over and over and over and over again the second time it plays your immediate thought is not hey someone s playing what s new pussycat again it s hey what s new pussycat is a lot longer than i first thought and it has like a dip in the middle you know how some songs have a dip like guns n roses november rain you re like hey november rain s over no it s not there s more the third time it plays you re thinking maybe someone s playing what s new pussycat again the fourth time it plays you re thinking whoa someone just played what s new pussycat four times or at least someone played it twice and it s a really long song so the fifth time is the kicker now we re watching the entire diner at this point most people have gotten wind as to what s going on and we re staring at this one guy and he s sitting in his booth and his like hand is shaking while his stupid kids jump around and like he s been on to us since the beginning and he s staring at his coffee cup like this and he has this look on his face like ah like he just got his thirty day chip from anger management he s staring like this and the fourth play fades out it s dead quiet and then i don t know if you know this but the song begins very subtly bwah bwa what s new pussycat and the guy goes god dammit and he pounds on the table and silverware flies everywhere and it was fantastic but a word about my friend john and what a genius he was because when we were first up at the jukebox and we were punching in the what s new pussycats alright i d punched in about seven and then john says to me hey hey hey wait before we drop in another what s new pussycat let s put in one it s not unusual and that is when the afternoon went from good to great after seven what s new pussycat s in a row suddenly dum da na dum da na na na na na it s not unusual and the sigh of relief has swept through the diner people were ecstatic it was like the liberation of france you know for years scientists have wondered can you make grown men and women weep tears of joy by playing tom jones it s not unusual and the answer is yes you can as long as it is preceded by seven what s new pussycat s and on the other hand when we went back holy shit it s not unusual fades out it s dead quiet bwah bwa what s new pussycat people went fucking insane no one could handle it no one could handle it and they were surrounded by like this seemingly indifferent staff you know that was just like yep same shit as always my only wish is that one of the schizophrenics had stood up and been like now you know now you know what it s like to live in my brain they unplug the jukebox after eleven plays and that was the best meal i ve ever had thank you very much san francisco this was great thank you hope to see you again real soon my name s john mulaney have a good night let s give it up for john mulaney 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there s a

the days when i was rockin a case with with no laces mouth filled with the braces couldn t even dress my whole style was tasteless was so basic but somehow i embraced it i saw you in the hall but wasn

staring in amazement glaze over my face from watching your cake switch with every pace i m tryna taste it just face it you re cheering from the crowd cause she s outta your league she even left you on a cloud and made it harder to breathe now i m sprung with nothing to show for it if i see you in the future i swear i ma go for it i see the way you move and i d be wrong not to let ya i m tryna keep my cool but you make it some damn hard not to sweat ya could this be deja vu i already feel like i met ya in some other lifetime i m feeling the same vibe cause i already feel like i met ya fast forward the saga continues years later at a venue with other friend dudes where i spotted your face like hindus before i got a chance to see the rest of your menu probably should ve been thinking of the ways to befriend you instead i m thinkin about all of the ways i could bend you i started walking forward with a hand to extend you i won t say nothing stupid i ain t tryna offend you before these other niggas you with start to defend you i meant to tell you you re fine and i commend you girl you re schooling em you re so damn bad i should suspend you and i ain t tryna be your man and won t pretend to that s all i had i couldn t think of nothing smart to say she kinda laughed and looked like she would walk away before she left she told me just what the business is that she s a lesbian and wasn t really interested  i see the way you move and i d be wrong not to let ya i m tryna keep my cool but you make it some damn hard not to sweat ya could this be deja vu i already feel like i met ya in some other lifetime i m i m feeling the same vibe cause i already feel like i met ya i ve been thinking bout you everyday and every night want you each and every way you d blow my mind i was thinking baby you should stay with me tonight so many things i want to say to ease your mind hate when she s so bad you might just do something regrettable body incredible ask any birdy the word on the street is she givin me wood cause that cashin my check i ma spend every cent on you passin your neck i ma smell every scent on you give my respect cause you earned it your smile just confirms it i m feeling like heaven was meant for you i must ve met you in some other life where i was your hubby and you was my wife it wasn t so fuzzy i remember like it was yesterday even though this is tonight feel like i ve been sippin on a million dollar pint of potion 9 i ve been mixing it with sprite i get to poking at your mind i get it open if you like it s like i m drilling through your thoughts to get you closer to the pipe i know what you like rose and candles and beaches with sandals but that ain t my vice i d rather beat it like rambo at least til my ammo is empty i m out like a light that would suffice that would be nice give it a shot that s my only advice but do what you like give me a call let me know if you re thinkin bout rolling the dice1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"calling on

was too but am i missing something more important in life it feels real but whens it ever real been through a lot chest full of memories the light of day is something they aint ever seen academic athletic and i rap with zest i stay fresh every season like im evergreen but this the one to drop the burdens hit the asphalt swerving but nothing brings me more pleasure than these melodies from then to now i aint changed at all i guess thats why the old me is so relatable but the deliveries im facing now are unplayable its got me questioning if im really capable to take the ball and making sure that any ankles broken on the way are unexplainable based on way its goin i wanna pave some more i dont care about the destination though as long as the journey is more entertaining like that 40 minute walk to kfc ok lets see yall follow the stream but at first it might not seem like the best decision g its a learning curve putting pen to pad like how i write these words combining them to tie a verse like laces on my trainers before i go out different places its still tight when i return aint no time concerns if not today we got tomorrow and someday yeah maybe someday we gon be up in the sky first class like harlow i wanna keep it g no borrowing identities but ive landed on a problem bout this very thing whats the point in someone telling me to stick with being me when im thinking differently its not that the person who i wanna be isnt me theres just a whole lot more i wanna be additionally moments with my idols i remember vividly trying learn from them and find a bit of symmetry observing them addictively like are you kidding me leading me to look at myself and doubt my ability but truthfully thats nothing new to me always under scrutiny people assuming things im an individual despite being part of communities against of the laws of life i have no immunity adapting to society is the only way youll stay alive in it i need to keep my cool in this hot climate better not lose it better not ruthless better not foolish better prudent be careful what you wish these moments fly too quick these moments like the snitch zooming cant catch a breath tense brows rarely loosen over my shoulders im carefully looking self conscious how i been moving i have innate good will but it didnt stop me from often staying secluded excuse me i just felt i had to pause take some deep breaths sometimes you need that time and space to reset id be lying if i told you i aint feel blessed but im still chasing heights i aint seen yet things starting to click like a seatbelt holding all these thoughts like a deep stretch this aint the fully painted picture its just a brief sketch sketch at the end of the day all i want is satisfaction of having done something that is valuable the most charming things are intangible the enchanted ambience is palpable im all instinct like an animal like my one handed screamer at mandeville a theory s all good until you try to make it practical and a plans all good until you have to be adaptable the worlds ever changing like the altitude just make sure that youve packed that parachute yeah okay alright looking out at the ocean tides they represent my emotional lows and highs tryna approach everything with an open mind and as a result see my dreams with open eyes these broken lines only grow my desire to overtake in terms of childhood im clocking an olden age but in terms of my lifes outlook im closin in on the golden age son of a gun load and aim best you check metservice again cause when im hitting all my targets expect pellets

at the ground that i ve been walking on i ve been walking on all last night well i dreamt i was cold started up a fire burning us out of control a face i barely recognize was staring out from the smoke then pointed at my blackened heart but the broken voice then spoke said plans are only wrecking balls then life gets on its way there s more to this than i recall probably more than i could say and if hate shall be your weapon lonely death shall be your toll and if profit is your motive then emptiness your soul emptiness your soul all last night well i dreamt i was gone nothing left but ashes a bitter taste upon your tongue shadows in the market where as a child i had once played abandoned in the evening like a bloodless serenade every moment crashing through my mind cold like the wind that whistles down the promenade where my love and i had been no countenance no reason for the things i may have done left stripped and standing naked in the place that i begun all come undone

stepping on cracks to break their mother s backs when they can t have their way sure people are getting better people are okay and we send our children running towards the future as if the future is the place to be and all we can see is the hope bleeding out of their eyes as they look up and watch the airlines plummet from the skies and they run past a young girl in a small cubby hole full of corroding cement because she doesn t run anymore see she s already dropped out of the race and in case you couldn t tell by looking at the lesions on her face she hangs a cardboard sign around her neck that reads i have aids please leave me alone and the kids put more quarters into the phone and then cry into the flat line of the dial tone and mom and dad say no you can t come home they say
