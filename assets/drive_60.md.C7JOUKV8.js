didn t hurt you why do i feel like i turned you maybe i don t understand it tell me is this how you planned it did you see us so stranded maybe i m too much to manage and if you weren t gonna guide me why bring me into the light must have done something to make you want to run and hide why oh why didn t you just live your life and every girl needs a mother and damn it i needed you instead you ducked for cover and you ran from the truth and like kids do you waited around for proof  maybe i didn t deserve you maybe i just couldn t cure you they told me that i didn t hurt you why do i feel

of spaced trees silhouetted against the horizon and hot still noons above a wilderness of clover and claude lorrain clouds inscribed remotely into misty azure with only their cumulus part conspicuous against the neutral swoon of the background or again it might be a stern el greco horizon pregnant with inky rain and a passing glimpse of some mummy necked farmer and all around alternating strips of quick silverish water and harsh green corn the whole arrangement opening like a fan we ll climb the mountains before we meet the sea the rain will stop eventually i ll drive slow across black ice and

of contentment around in the air we re off now to seek all our fortunes to the land of our dreams riding the waves and the storm is upon us the winds lash the sails but the ropes keep them tight off in the distance a dark cloud approaching none could imagine what there was to come no there s no one going back no there s not a second chance as we strap onto the side we pray to god that we won t die  as we ride the rough seas as we soak from the ocean waves i just hope for all our lives and pray that i survive four ships are lost in the stormy conditions the spirits of the sunken crews their phantoms follow us spirits sails they drive us on through the all consuming waves cold mortality no weapon against these ever raging seas four leagues and ten and we hit storms again we just can t get away from the eye of the storm the birds outsoar the raging storm but we cannot escape it abandoned earth that we now crave is many leagues from save holding on for our dear lives and we re praying

our golden promised land weary limbs fatigued away i have no life left in me no more strength no nothing left to give must find the will to live never thought that we could make it truly sight of

ve been travelin for some time with my fishin pole and my bottle of shine on these long dark dusty roads lookin there s nowhere to go i guess i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to

again solid on the surface as i crumble within but legends are made out of vulnerable men so on the brink of death i still manage livin life cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice i indeed sold my soul without glancing at the price no instructions when i was handed this device but with what i did get i was more than generous put others over self on several instances but i m back on my feet without a hint of bitterness and one way or another i shall have deliverance so i say i ve been travelin for some time with my fishin pole and my bottle of shine on these long dark dusty roads lookin there s nowhere to go i guess i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to find my way i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to find my way ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy  can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally toast in the new south this one is for history then i slipped fell and caused the number s injury called the same people and it s yo you just missed them b this the formula dammit bubba you had it why d you have to keep it polo and new balance then they start to question whether you a true talent or just a redneck substance abuse addict so then you hide away just to try to find your way and now they back to callin you two hundred times a day i want all y all to know good or bad i ll remember it and ten million sold in the name of my deliverance i ve been travelin for some time with my fishin pole and my bottle of shine on these long dark dusty roads lookin there s nowhere to go i guess i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to find my way i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to find my way ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy ayy nothing could atone for the pain you ve endured the blood you shed is still stainin your velour you took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor only to discover that your savior s manure accepted me as kin put before your younger brother they put a lot on us hardly knowin one another i honestly can say that over time i ve come to love you now we are brothers and together no one can touch us it haunts me with regret i never met your baby girl she s an angel on your shoulder helpin us to save the world this musical marriage is no coincidence on my mamma timmy baby we shall have deliverance so we say i ve been travelin for some time with my fishin pole and my bottle of shine on these long dark dusty roads lookin there s nowhere to go i guess i gotta hide away far away cause i gotta find a way to find my way i gotta hide away far away cause i

studying for years and i ve been getting lost along the way as i disconnect the past and present others have defined my biggest fears now i don t hear a single word they say open eyes clouded for a history walking blind believing what we think we believe and no we won t stop we won t stop building in our invisible worlds and when they fall the clarity will kill us all and it comes to us by nature the confidence in how it all should be everyone s a criminal of pride and we reach inside of one another vilify the past and let it speak and whatever remains is cast aside we build our walls and hope they never fade away no and what feels like comfort ends up being our decay until open eyes clouded from a history come to find all the people underneath","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"when
