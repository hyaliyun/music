tenderness of being in between an ego that i force myself to feed ignoring what i want for what i need i wanna emphasize on your blessings loving you in your sections doing full time when i check in tempted by feelings that feel so familiar blinded by love and all of the above taking by wishes with no permission permitted i hate that my lifestyle has caused you to think that i m not committed the more that i say i don t want it i know that i need it you take it away and let me do all the fiening you know how much i crave you you know how much i hate to but you give me that discipline then put some cinnamon on it girl damn you re so sweet to me do what you wanna i could kiss on your feet you got all of the heat on me your winning me over i hate being sober just doesn t feel the same anymore

champagne that s lame no game hommie i rep christ you can peep my and the way that i write i surrendered everything even my rights i count it all lost just so i can know christ or better yet baby just so that he can know me as a son coming home from prodigal to free free from my sin that s the end of my grief i m a believer so best believe this is me even at the cross jesus took my place he didn t deserve it i guess that s what we call faith i did deserve it i guess that s what you call grace he did it for certain and guaranteed my place in him and then seated me on high in the end baby i ll be caught up in the sky on a dime in the twinkling of an eye i ll be found in the air with my savior jesus christ i m a believer i m a believer no doubt i m a believer yeah i m a believer hear me out i m a believer yeah i m a believer yeah yeah he came into my life and i never thought twice he s all that i have and i m willing to fight i stare at them like i m a believer some might know me as a rapper some might know me as a southern dude others as a black man but first i got another crew ever since i heard the gospel message how the son was bruised i got a new identity it s like your boy s another dude we ain t undercover brother come and see us trust the truths that we stand under brother other things adjust and move some say we dumb for trusting christ they say we just some fools but you can check his grave if you want it proved ooh we ain t perfect at all nah we recognize this life s hard the difference is instead of drowning we trust the life guard we fight hard but with the right perspective as we walk this christ he works in us like an office so i m a believer i m a believer i m a believer no doubt i m a believer yeah i m a believer hear me out i m a believer yeah i m a believer yeah yeah so in the end hey this is me i ain t that cat that you seen on tv i ain t that rapper model actor baller none of them defines me i m a believer known to the one that exist in three co heir to the kingdom this means i m the king s son partner that s what defines me identity crucified choose to die now the life that i live not i but it s this flesh he laid to rest through faith i live by christ i m quite sure your mama told you not to trust just anybody but tell me who is like the lord not anybody i took a look at him in the scriptures this really got me he keeps his promises even though cats be living sloppy look at his love and his grace and his just mercy i was dirty till i trusted him who s trustworthy i m a believer i m a believer no doubt i m a believer yeah i m a
