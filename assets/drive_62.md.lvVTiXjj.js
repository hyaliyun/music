restaurant that s just the name of the song and that s why i called the song alice s restaurant you can get anything you want at alice s restaurant you can get anything you want at alice s restaurant walk right in it s around the back just a half a mile from the railroad track you can get anything you want at alice s restaurant now it all started two thanksgivings ago was on two years ago on thanksgiving when my friend and i went up to visit alice at the restaurant but alice doesn t live in the restaurant she lives in the church nearby the restaurant in the bell tower with her husband ray and fasha the dog and living in the bell tower like that they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be in having all that room seeing as how they took out all the pews they decided that they didn t have to take out their garbage for a long time we got up there we found all the garbage in there and we decided it would be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump so we took the half a ton of garbage put it in the back of a red vw microbus took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump well we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying closed on thanksgiving and we had never heard of a dump closed on thanksgiving before and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage we didn t find one until we came to a side road and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage and we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down that s what we did and drove back to the church had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn t be beat went to sleep and didn t get up until the next morning when we got a phone call from officer obie he said kid we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of garbage and just wanted to know if you had any information about it and i said yes sir officer obie i cannot tell a lie i put that envelope under that garbage after speaking to obie for about forty five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down and pick up the garbage and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer s station so we got in the red vw microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer s station now friends there was only one or two things that obie coulda done at the police station and the first was that he could have given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone which wasn t very likely and we didn t expect it and the other thing was that he could have bawled us out and told us never to be seen driving garbage around the vicinity again which is what we expected but when we got to the police officer s station there was a third possibility that we hadn t even counted upon and we was both immediately arrested handcuffed and i said obie i don t think i can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on he said shut up kid get in the back of the patrol car and that s what we did sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the quote scene of the crime unquote i wanna tell you about the town of stockbridge massachusetts where this happened here they got three stop signs two police officers and one police car but when we got to the scene of the crime there was five police officers and three police cars being the biggest crime of the last fifty years and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it and they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer s station they was taking plaster tire tracks foot prints dog smelling prints and they took twenty seven eight by ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us took pictures of the approach the getaway the northwest corner the southwest corner and that s not to mention the aerial photography after the ordeal we went back to the jail obie said he was going to put us in the cell said kid i m going to put you in the cell i want your wallet and your belt and i said obie i can understand you wanting my wallet so i don t have any money to spend in the cell but what do you want my belt for and he said kid we don t want any hangings i said obie did you think i was going to hang myself for littering obie said he was making sure and friends obie was cause he took out the toilet seat so i couldn t hit myself over the head and drown and he took out the toilet paper so i couldn t bend the bars roll out the roll the toilet paper out the window slide down the roll and have an escape obie was making sure and it was about four or five hours later that alice alice came by and with a few nasty words to obie on the side bailed us out of jail and we went back to the church had another thanksgiving dinner that couldn t be beat and didn t get up until the next morning when we all had to go to court we walked in sat down obie came in with the twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one sat down man came in said all rise we all stood up and obie stood up with the twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog and he sat down we sat down obie looked at the seeing eye dog and then at the twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and looked at the seeing eye dog and then at twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry cause obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of american blind justice and there wasn t nothing he could do about it and the judge wasn t going to look at the twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us and we was fined 50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow but that s not what i came to tell you about came to talk about the draft they got a building down new york city it s called whitehall street where you walk in you get injected inspected detected infected neglected and selected i went down to get my physical examination one day and i walked in i sat down got good and drunk the night before so i looked and felt my best when i went in that morning because i wanted to look like the all american kid from new york city man i wanted i wanted to feel like the all i wanted to be the all american kid from new york and i walked in sat down i was hung down brung down hung up and all kinds

stuff like that and all the phenome and he stopped me right there and said kid did you ever go to court and i proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight by ten color glossy pictures

walked over to the to the bench there and there is group w s where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committing your special crime and there was all kinds of mean

with a heart of gold that likened him to all the stories he told of past battles won and lost and legends of old a seasoned veteran in his own time on the battlefield he gained respectful fame with many medals of bravery and stripes to his name he grew a beard as soon as he could to cover the scars on his face and always urged his men on but on the eve of a great battle with the infantry in dream the old general tossed in his sleep and wrestled with its meaning he awoke from that night to tell what he had seen and walked slowly out of his tent all the men held tall with their chests in the air with courage in their blood and a fire in their stare and it was a grey morning and they all wondered how they would fare till the old general told them to go home he said i have seen the others and i have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting and i ve seen their mothers and i will no other to follow me where i m going so take your shower shine your shoes you got no time to lose you are young and you must be living so take your shower shine your shoes you got no time to lose you are young and you must be living go now you are forgiven yeah  but the men stood fast with their guns on their shoulders not knowing what to do with their contradicting orders the general said he would do his own duty but he would extend it no further the men could go as they pleased but not a man moved their eyes gazed straight ahead till one by one they stepped back and not a word was said and the old general was left with his own words echoing in his head he then prepared to fight he said i have seen the others and i have discovered that this fight is not worth fighting and i ve seen their mothers and i will no other to follow me where i m going go now you are forgiven go now

for winter this year but you came and it never appeared me and you we know too many reasons for people and seasons that pass like they weren t even here now living in smiles is better you say but we carry the burdens of all of our days so i m scared that you ll leave and you re scared that i ll stay it s an impossibility day and we only saw half the ballet  i said goodnight goodbye it seems like a good thing so you know it s a good lie you can run out of choices and still hear a voice in your head when you re lying in bed and it says that the best part of a bad day is knowing it s okay the color of everything changes the sky rearranges its shade and your smile doesn t fade into a phone call and one bad decision we made and the worst part of a good day is the one thing you don t say and you don t know how but you wish there was some way so you pull down the shades and you shut off the lights because somehow we mixed up goodbye and goodnight and the one thing you won t say is everyone knows possibility days are impossible it just feels wrong so wrong still you re gone long gone3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"remember what confucius taught always be kind yes mother always help the

in the same direction the selection of contingent messages postponed until further notice because i was ashamed to admit the problem and pretend your happiness came from me and that your happiness was important but we aborted the sordid truths we once distorted when i saw the shape of your dress when you wore it and that was enough until it wasn t and that s when you finally felt supported so the others courted you and you mentally recorded and endorsed the force perform of compliments you received came in and you felt empowered enough to take your final bow and find love within the arms of another instead of this heart of mine and that s fine because i would do the same and i would leave me not because i m useless and not because i m broken not because i m sad and not because i m worthless but because i saw value in your smile and not in your values and i m sorry and i love you and that s why i can finally sleep at night because you are free and you can thrive and i m just happy i got to be a part of your life i m just happy i got to be a part of the journey that you call your life and i finally feel fine cause i spent so long trying to change you not realizing i was the one who needed to change i was selfish to assume you loved me more than you love yourself even though i never felt the same and there s so many things that my selfishness tried to take away but you were the one that was the hardest to watch walk away but thank you for letting me be a part of everything you were building and creating and finding truth in life and you were relating so much beauty and i love you and i m sorry thank you for letting me be a part of your journey thank you for letting me be me and thank you for setting me free and showing me love and showing me love in its

doja keep me high to see the lord almighty nigga i m ready to die my reply for any questions asked the devil made me do it who s the devil may i ask it s so polluted uprooted from all this stupid shit see me cremated my adaption to the climate so glad i made it elated that they gon go to heaven but do they know heaven may not be the place to go again i ask heaven was hell and vica versa the devil s in me and i ll be damned if i m gon let god hurt ya follow me  if this was vica versa i d be an angel cause i m a devil a down south georgia rebel a whole nother fuckin level reminiscin on all the
