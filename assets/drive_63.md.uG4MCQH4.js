all that is me resides inside my poetry every time i write a rhyme it might be the line that sets minds free and also i know that i don t know shit and the more i know the more i realize it i know that for all of the pain i ve cried there s the exact same balance of joy on the other side of that coin joined with the thinnest slip of membrane same goes for crazy and sane truth and lie answer and why because i know this this universe operates with a divine tug of war teeter totter bringing order and balance like the tide does to water like i know that each wave rolls back to the sea retreating from me into deep green eternity and i know that i am free well at least in my mind if i wanna be i know that some things sound good to me in theory but in point of fact suck ass in actual practice like communism and pornography i know that it s impossible to really know where anyone is coming from so who are we to judge em i know that some things are so dope they transcend their category and it s important to see the glory in the ordinary like i know there s nag champa and there s all other incense i can t see putting earl gray against any other tea lash out it s not even on the same plane as other mascaras comparatively and i know that there s r b and then there s otis redding i know that most things are greater than the sums of their parts and that s the real definition of art like brownies are good and so is whipped cream but you put em together and it s this whole fucking chemical other thing like lennon and mccartney singing harmony like masturbating as compared to an orgy i know that everything within this surface glimpse of reality is infinitely simple and perfectly complicated and i know that being jaded and over it is way overrated and that the colors of this world only seem faded in direct relation to the darkness with which your mind s eye is shaded and you made it that way and you can choose to change your vision s prismic range today and i know that you gotta help a friend who s down and i know that no matter where you end up you re still from your home town and i know that you gotta know how to listen to the sound of your own heart beat in the dead quiet of night sometimes and i know that can be so frightening but i also know that the deepest darkness is always the most enlightening and i know that fresh cold cantaloupe tastes like the perfect first kiss and i know that lao tsu and moses and mohammed and buddha and jesus and all those dudes knew some deep ass shit but i also know that we all hold the world s eternal truths in our heart s deepest pit it s because i know that we are made up of the same stuff as the sun and the moon and the farthest stars and all that we are is manifest energy and that we already have everything that we could ever need if we could just begin to see clearly and i know that the world will continue to spin and i know that the world will continue to spin and i know that one day you will let me in and we will begin to love in a fashion i couldn t fathom existed and we will laugh at the fact that we ever resisted this blissful togetherness and the sex well it ll be off the charts cause we ll both be super freaky but we ll be fucking from the heart cause our loving will be something where the whole is much greater than the sum of the parts cause we re artists after all so what else would fate have us make besides art and i know that outside of this space time frame we are one and the same we re a part not apart so i know that i can wait patiently for it to start and far out i may seem to be and maybe you may see me as wacky but baby the fact be that i am a poet and like all true poets do i m mainlining the spiraling spherical truth of the universe turning it out and into lyrical wholeness

in the river and thought it was a fur coat twelve years ago i stood on the shore and jumped in and grabbed the coat the river was rushing toward a waterfall and and my friend stood at the shore and

fatter i feel the blues coming on we get bruised we get battered but we ll pick up the pieces that scattered and with emotional glue we re gonna stick together body and mind ever since she went away i ve been alone to contemplate time and space and why world s move while sitting in my solitude i ve watched the stars and wondered why they re scattered up there in the sky and is she up there out of view on some higher platitude i wish i knew wish i could prove the reason why this life on earth is scattered like the universe i m scattered here and scattered there bits of me scattered everywhere to the fields we are scattered then from the dust we are born we survive somewhat battered to a new life a new dawn in the end what will it matter there ll only be my ashes to scatter and all the

believe it s true she doesn t ask her parents before she says i do and what about my husband oblivious naive this evening s getting serious these ohioans won t leave but i can t let these latest problems rob me of my bliss for when i m scared of true disaster i remember this death is just around the corner waiting patiently to strike one unplanned electrocution that s the kind of end i can comprehend when i m feeling uninspired or i need a little spree i m reborn knowing death is just around the corner coming after me  get it coroner death is just around the coroner death is just around the corner waiting high upon the hill someone buried in an avalanche that s the kind of gig i can really dig marriage often disappoints you not each husband is a gem so i ll mourn knowing death is just around the corner coming after them if life s all plums i ll muddle through some but when death comes i hope it s gruesome some people die from public stoning faulty wiring faulty zoning cherry pits they didn t know were there it could be by a jungle cat a slippery mat a baseball bat perhaps an unsuccessful love affair it could be on a speeding train it could be underwater it could be too much novocain or even by your daughter perhaps a bad mosquito bite a title fight religious rite my darlings it might even be tonight death is just around the corner no one s ever been immune turning off a respirator with a simple click scandalously quick i can face a new tomorrow if i make it past today i feel good saying death is just around the corner simply on its way death is just around the corner and you have to heed the call for your death is just around the corner happy being both the mourned and mourner because death is just around the corner coming for us

street light i stop and look and listen to the sound as the raindrops penetrate the silence all around alone i gaze into the glistening street the distant thunder echoing my heartbeat urging me on to a secret goal away from the light from this lamp on a pole so i turn slip away into the rain drifting like a spirit through the shadows in the lane clutching the tools of my trade in my hand an old box of matches and a gasoline can darkness envelopes the scene like a shroud a veil of emptiness hangs from the clouds filling up the cracks in this desolate place cradled by the night in an icy embrace moving to the town like a ghost in the rain a dim reflection in a dark window pane blackness beckons from every side creeping all around like an incoming tide a broken window in an empty house i slip inside and begin to douse the whole place with the fuel that will feed the fire and push back the night taking me higher on out of the darkness in a deafening roar the match in my hand is the key to the door a simple turn of the wrist will suffice to open a passage to paradise i pause i think about the past and the gloom the smell of gasoline permeates the room everyone has a little secret he keeps i light the fires while the city sleeps the match makes a graceful arc to the floor and time stands still as i turn for the door which explodes in a fireball and throws me to the street i hit the ground running with the flames at my feet reaching for the night which recoils from the fire the raindrops hiss like a devilish choir dying in the flames with a terrible sound calling all the names of the sleepers all around but then in the arms of the night they lay their dreams sprout wings and fly away out of the houses in a gathering flock swarming overhead as i hurry down the block i

for nobody i suppose it s true we make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths to see the flashing lights at photo shoots we make our motive moves i say whatever i feel to vent a rhyme so i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine cause real recognise real is what my father says and i ll be sticking to this phrase until i pass away overworking no sleep is just
