too long these voices muffled by distances it s time to come to our senses up from the dirt we give it all now there s a reason why i sing so give it all and it s these reasons that belong to me breathe the air we give the life we live our pulses racing distances so wet my tongue break into song through seas of competition so please believe your eyes a sacrifice is not what we had in our minds i m coming home tonight home tonight  we give it all now there s a reason why i sing so give it all and it s these reasons that belong to me today i offer all myself to this i m living for my

wondering what she can do and she tries tonight remembering who she once knew but they ve died inside another empty bottle takes a life this world can be so cruel she lives her life as a broken tool and she believes she s unable to fix this broken machine and what s the use to throw yourself at love if in the end it never seems enough to be able to get through all of life s broken dreams she watched her father live in regret heard her mother cry in an empty bed and she swears this is the best life gets and she lies tonight underneath a caving roof and she cries tonight wondering what she could do and she tries tonight but she s out of memories that she once knew and she dies inside another empty bottle takes a life  and every little bit every little bit of her wants to see that light but every single night another little bit of her dies inside she s trapped in her mind she feels more alive she feels more alive in her own dreams and she s wondering what s beyond the sky could she see the light if she falls asleep cause she feels more alive in her own dreams so tonight she lies lifted up through her own roof dried eyes tonight there s nothing more that she could do and they cry
