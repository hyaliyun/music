and no ceilings as far as i know just the echoes of scars and the unbeaten road trip the gun on cautions that i ve been sold cause it s hard to believe that it s wrong to want more than the truest of blue and a love like a roar i will run to wherever i want to go oh charting neptune by the fire of the sun i m looking for new constellations new constellations so keep callin me crazy cause i never learned you should stop loving fire because you got burned now it feels like i m living some sick d¨¦j¨¤ vu like the answers were there when i stared into you child of neptune i m the daughter of the

to achieve any degree of understanding in the ensuing years which are three in number i presume herb means that inherently you cannot be commercial and artistic you cannot be commercial concurrent with having a preoccupation with the level of storytelling that you want to achieve and this i have to reject i don t think calling something commercial tags it with a kind of an odious suggestion that it stinks that it s something raunchy to be ashamed of i don t think if you say commercial means to be publicly acceptable what s wrong with that as long as you are not ashamed of anything you write if you re a writer as long as you re not ashamed of anything you perform if you re an actor and i m not ashamed of anything this is the area i know but i think innate in what herb says is the suggestion made by many people that you can t have public acceptance and still be artistic and as i said i have to reject that just two bodies just two bodies i ve been so ready to dim my mind come
