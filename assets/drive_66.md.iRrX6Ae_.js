our families to understand our needs the love and all the hate i used to hold in front of me restless nights all dizzy spells all sand between my sheets showing signs of thirst like dried out boardwalk blistered feet and now i know i never knew about you only me we carried this inside like some disease we couldn t beat but we could work to try to live and get by to make our family in a second floor apartment standing on a threshold body out and flesh cold go ahead and celebrate the things you lost try to grieve to flex and release to cry and work out with the underrate apartment moments are a lifetime lockin in a straight line this could take a little while to shake things off down by the water s edge under a dying tree i let my body slip something inside of me but when i came around some kind of murky face i don t ever want to be alone like this and i will tuck into you like i always long to be shadows just a shade of light not darkness in degree it was you who knew me first saw this wasn t meant for kids like me some brutal natural force we only feel we never see but as you grip the tide you blundered aside your heads got smaller until they vanished into silence sinking in a white foam running to a new home we can only understand the things we see you cease desist and view me like this the eyes wide open in the beauty of the bright lights standing on a threshold body out and flesh cold i don t ever want to be alone like this no i have no choice but to be vicious on my feet i never sleep i never eat i am learning how to be lost completely i want to be found we crave the things we push away these patterns cut like every day i need you to reach i need you to need me down by the water s edge under a dying tree i let my body slip something inside of me but when i came around some kind of murky face shakin my bones put me back in my place i don t ever want to be alone like this haunted by the presence of the things i miss i don t ever want to be alone like this haunted by the presence of the things i miss no i am becoming the ghost of myself oh i am becoming the ghost of myself trapped little secrets little things we never tell oh i am becoming the ghost of myself","artist_name":"Voxtrot"},{"lyrics":"ay when i give you these keys homeboy don t move my car man i m right in the front ya dig don t move my shit man whoa whoa baby what s

but my heartfelt proclamation of a god who saves men without obligation from sin s domination and the bonds of satan nobody sins in moderation that s obvious from our evil thoughts to our conversation we were dead we needed more than an operation we had to be brought out the grave and made alive awakened it s quite amazing how in salvation each person of the trinity contributes like a compilation the father elected me jesus bled for me and regeneration is the holy spirit s confirmation so we repent of our abominations consecration to the god who s exalted above the constellations the observation of the congregation is god is gracious with a lot of patience so we gotta praise him chorus we ll forever praise his mercy and grace praise the lord for his mercy and grace his mercy and grace and christ took the curse in our place praise the lord for his mercy and grace verse 2 when i speak of god s mercy i m speaking of his tendency to tenderly express empathy towards his enemies whether it be mentally or outright obscenity we effectively deserve hell for our enmity adam left a legacy of sin since we share in his pedigree we therefore share in his destiny if god didn t intervene we d all perish eventually in his great mercy he gave us the remedy christ lived sinlessly then he paid the penalty his assassination was public like john kennedy rose on the third day exalted to the heavenlies repent and see your sins will be deleted from his memory gain a new identity eternal serenity now it s clear we should volunteer like tennessee to spread his fame endlessly the message is essentially a merciful god sent his son to set sinners free chorus verse 3 in mercy christ saw our wretched condition but instead of giving us death for our sinning in grace his blood paid the debt that s infinite now resurrected with christ and blessed because we re in him mercy christ turned the father s anger grace christ earned us all his favor and since christ kept the precepts of the law because of his perfection we re accepted by god real righteousness he gladly gives us the father happily lavishes this instead of filthy rags our dad s forgiveness the ultimate story of rags to riches his grace displayed in saving the worst men behold god s riches of grace are a person christ the fountain abounding in his grace over my foul sin and mountains of mistakes in pleasure he s immeasurably gracious now we re seated with jesus in the heavenly places plus his spirit s the strength that will change tim he daily gives the grace of sanctification forever we ll praise the i am who gave us grace in the lamb before the ages began so shai with that resume the chorus because of the cross all his attributes are for us chorus refrain shai yo tim that was a bangin verse b tim nah remember i m a sinner saved by mercy shai what s mercy tim it s not getting what we deserve because christ already suffered the judgment and curse but shai yo you blazed it ace shai

that it s hard to know the answers when you don t know the questions cause she don t understand why she feels the way she does no matter what she tries man it never is enough and a few months back for one night i felt the pain that she felt her whole life cause she called and said that she was ready to go and said thanks for everything but she was ready to go i said please don t there s something you gotta know i wrote a song about you and this is how it goes  it was five hours later when we hung up she was tired and the sun was startin to come up but yo we spent that whole night just talkin it through and at that point there wasn t much more i could do but what i did say is that she needed to promise me she wouldn t do anything crazy without callin me and so far man things have been better we talk way less cause things have been better and last time she called was my birthday night and it was the best gift i ve gotten in my life she said remember that time when you sang me that

frank or cousin louie is it bob or joe or walter could it be bill or jim or ed or bernie or steve i probably would have kept on guessing but about that time we crashed into a truck and as i m laying bleeding there on the asphalt finally i recognize the face of my hibachi dealer who takes off his prosthetic lips and tells me everything you know is wrong black is white up is down and short is long and everything you thought was just so important doesn t matter everything you know is wrong just forget the words and sing along all you need to understand is everything you know is wrong i was walking to the kitchen for some golden grahams when i accidentally stepped into an alternate dimension and soon i was abducted by some aliens from space who kinda looked like jamie farr they sucked out my internal organs and they took some polaroids and said i was a darn good sport and as a way of saying thank you they offered to transport me back to any point in history that i would care to go and so i had them send me back to last thursday night so i could pay my phone bill on time just then the floating disembodied head of colonel sanders started yelling everything you know is wrong black is white up is down and short is long and everything you thought was just so important doesn t matter everything you know is wrong just forget the words and sing along all you need to understand is everything you know is wrong  i was just about to mail a letter to my evil twin when i got a nasty paper cut and well to make a long story short it got infected and i died so now i m up in heaven with saint peter by the pearly gates and it s obvious he doesn t like the nehru jacket that i m wearing he tells me that they ve got a dress code well he lets me into heaven anyway but i get the room next

jerry s bait shop well anyway back then life was going swell and everything was just peachy except of course for the undeniable fact that every single morning my mother would make me a big ol bowl of sauerkraut for breakfast aw big bowl of sauerkraut every single mornin it was driving me crazy i said to my mom i said hey mom what s up with all the sauerkraut and my dear sweet mother she just looked at me like a cow looks at an oncoming train and she leaned right down next to me and she said it s good for you and then she tied me to the wall and stuck a funnel in my mouth and force fed me nothing but sauerkraut until i was twenty six and a half years old that s when i swore that someday someday i would get outta that basement and travel to a magical far away place where the sun is always shining and the air smells like warm root beer and the towels are oh so fluffy where the shriners and the lepers play their ukuleles all day long and anyone on the street will gladly shave your back for a nickel wacka wacka doodoo yeah well let me tell you people it wasn t long at all before my dream came true because the very next day a local radio station had this contest to see who could correctly guess the number of molecules in leonard nimoy s butt i was off by three but i still won the grand prize that s right a first class one way ticket to albuquerque albuquerque  oh yeah you know i d never been on a real airplane before and i gotta tell ya it was really great except that i had to sit between two large albanian women with excruciatingly severe body odor and the little kid in back of me kept throwin up the whole time the flight attendants ran out of dr pepper and salted peanuts and the in flight movie was bio dome with pauly shore and oh yeah three of the airplane engines burned out and we went into a tailspin and crashed into a hillside and the plane exploded in a giant fireball and everybody died except for me you know why cause i had my tray table up and my seat back in the full upright position had my tray table up and my seat back in the full upright position had my tray table up and my seat back in the full upright position ah ha ha ha ah ha ha ah so i crawled from the twisted burnin wreckage i crawled on my hands and knees for three full days draggin along my big leather suitcase and my garment bag and my tenor saxophone and my twelve pound bowling ball and my lucky lucky autographed glow in the dark snorkel but finally i arrived at the world famous albuquerque holiday inn where the towels are oh so fluffy and you can eat your soup right out of the ashtrays if you wanna it s okay they re clean well i checked into my room and i turned down the a c and i turned on the spectravision and i m just about to eat that little chocolate mint on my pillow that i love so very very much when suddenly there s a knock on the door well now who could that be i say who is it no answer who is it there s no answer who is it they re not sayin anything so finally i go over and i open the door and just as i suspected it s some big fat hermaphrodite with a flock of seagulls haircut and only one nostril oh man i hate it when i m right so anyway he bursts into my room and he grabs my lucky snorkel and i m like hey you can t have that that snorkel s been just like a snorkel to me and he s like tough and i m like give it and he s like make me and i m like kay so i grabbed his leg and he grabbed my esophagus and i bit off his ear and he chewed off my eyebrows and i took out his appendix and he gave me a colonic irrigation yes indeed you better believe it and somehow in the middle of it all the phone got knocked off the hook and twenty seconds later i heard a familiar voice and you know what it said i ll tell you what it said it said if you d like to make a call please hang up and try again if you need help hang up and then dial your operator if you d like to make a call please hang up and try again if you need help hang up and then dial your operator in albuquerque albuquerque well to cut a long story short he got away with my snorkel but i made a solemn vow right then and there that i would not rest i would not sleep for an instant until the one nostrilled man was brought to justice but first i decided to buy some donuts so i got in my car and i drove over to the donut shop and i walked on up to the guy behind the counter and he says yeah what do ya want i said you got any glazed donuts he said no we re outta glazed donuts i said you got any jelly donuts he said no we re outta jelly donuts i said you got any bavarian cream filled donuts he said no we re outta bavarian cream filled donuts i said you got any cinnamon rolls he said no we re outta cinnamon rolls i said you got any apple fritters he said no we re outta apple fritters i said you got any bear claws he said wait a minute i ll go check no we re outta bear claws i said well in that case in that case what do you have he says all i got right now is this box of one dozen starving crazed weasels i said okay i ll take that so he hands me the box and i open up the lid and the weasels jump out and they immediately latch onto my face and start bitin me all over oh man they were just going nuts they were tearin me apart you know i think it was just about that time that a little ditty started goin through my head i believe it went a little something like this doh get em off me get em off me no get em off get em off oh oh god oh god oh get em off me oh oh god i ran out into the street with these flesh eating weasels all over my face wavin my arms all around and just runnin runnin runnin like a constipated wiener dog and as luck would have it that s exactly when i ran into the girl of my dreams her name was zelda she was a calligraphy enthusiast with a slight overbite and hair the color of strained peaches i ll never forget the first thing she said to me she said hey you ve got weasels on your face that s when i knew it was true love we were inseparable after that aw we ate together we bathed together we even shared the same piece of mint flavored dental floss the world was our burrito so we got married and we bought us a house and had two beautiful children nathaniel and superfly oh we were so very very very happy aw yeah but then one fateful night zelda said to me she said sweetie pumpkin do you wanna join the columbia record club i said whoa hold on now baby i m just not ready for that kind of a commitment so we broke up and i never saw her again but that s just the way things go in albuquerque albuquerque anyway things really started lookin up for me because about a week later i finally achieved my lifelong dream that s right i got me a part time job at the sizzler i even made employee of the month after i put out that grease fire with my face aw yeah everybody was pretty jealous of me after that i was gettin a lot of attitude ok like one time i was out in the parking lot tryin to remove my excess earwax with a golf pencil when i see this guy marty tryin to carry a big ol sofa up the stairs all by himself so i i say to him i say hey you want me to help you with that and marty he just rolls his eyes and goes no i want you to cut off my arms and legs with a chainsaw so i did and then he gets all indignant on me he s like hey man i was just being sarcastic well that s just great how was i supposed to know that i m not a mind reader for cryin out loud besides now he s got a really cute nickname torso boy so what s he complaining about say that reminds me of another amusing anecdote this guy comes up to me on the street and says he hasn t had a bite in three days well i knew what he meant but just to be funny i took a big bite out of his jugular vein and he s yellin and screamin and bleeding all over and i m like hey come on don tcha get it but he just keeps rolling around on the sidewalk bleeding and screaming you know just completely missing the irony of the whole situation man some people just can t take a joke you know anyway um um where was i kinda lost my train of thought uh well uh okay anyway i i know it s kinda been a roundabout way of saying it but i guess the whole point i m tryin to make here is i hate sauerkraut that s all i m really tryin to say and by the way if one day you happen to wake up and find yourself in an existential quandary full of loathing and self doubt and wracked with the pain and isolation of your pitiful meaningless existence at least you can take a small bit of comfort in knowing that somewhere out there in this crazy old mixed up universe of ours there s

met girl he s a puppet to nature one year later now so deeply and sickly in love it makes him hate her the average romanticized american relationship sinks capsized when either side becomes a slave to

insanely consumed with him give her the guilt trip and maybe she ll quit living to stay behind his prison walls and lose all individualism well this is happiness masochistic torture plagued by the decadent craved for affection the needle digs deep to push contentment through his bloodstream it drowned out hollow the pothole of a junkie if he could only hear her sing he wouldn t wanna break her wings but emptiness has such a warm subtle sting she makes up for what he lacks trapped he can t imagine life without someone like that we ve rediscovered the long lost art of dying only the lonely resent angels for flying twisted living off eachother s sickness like parasites this is paradise we ve rediscovered the long lost art of dying only the lonely resent angels for flying addicted afraid to take control of my own life this is paradise what a beautiful world emotionally destroyed her became plural when girl met boy between several breakups and plenty relapses routine read comfort led to serious attachment now every once in a while she forgets to breathe terrified of losing em paradise is misery too much faith in the lifesaving knight in shining armour now what knight s noticing the scar she can t hide any longer but they were her story way before he was it s gross hope to think that he would heal such deep cuts at first it felt so right but after one too many fights he turned out that hallway light and all the wonder turned to spite so they sleep in the same bed with guns to eachother s heads dead the romance boiling the blood that painted roses red suffering from post honeymoon s disease leeched to his whole existence she ll die if he decides to leave addicted to the way she feels when they spend time together detouring the now in a childish attempt to find forever despite the fact they hold eachother heart to heart you can t be that close to somebody without being so far apart  silence is is the most obscure sound i ve ever heard those lonely giant spaces in between your every word and maybe i m totally crazy for holdin on but just cause i m insane don t mean that i m wrong now that she s gone i can t sleep at night i barely even function right my memory s on overdrive too hungry and too cold to cry miss the companionship i once took for granted the way you helped me manage the partnership that vanished but i don t expect you to stay chained

what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will that s blood spilled on your hands my plan s rather vindictive everybody s a victim in my eyes when i ride it s a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering get em i got em and i ain t give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality it s a trip how we trip

to get it and she know they got me i watch her feelings watch me as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness look each other in the face and barely blink i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink so if my letters don t reach you i hope these in sync where are we going why are we slowing down where are you going we should be growing now that s what it said to me but the place i call ambition now dead to me gone and forgotten i m off track like dale earnhardt my liver rotten alcoholic tripping fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions club night guys and dolls balling out but i m bout to drop the ball i m calling out for help my engineer called told me come to the studio i wanna tell him nah where are we going why are we slowing down where are you going we should be growing now that s what he said to me but that place we call heaven unfair to me only 144 can go seven billion people on planet earth today is there something that i don t know i know to follow him rather following people or follow vanity cause that means i m following evil guess i m following evil i should follow cathedral blessings i need but live like i don t need you  where are we going why are we slowing down where are you going we should be growing now so in conclusion we all seem to stumble planning our own demise forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size so to what is important in my life i apologize i promise to stay faithful focused and sanctified we all get distracted the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards would you not know how to act or take action it s just a part of life and if your vision s impaired you probably lose it all tonight tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision s so blurry tryna slow it down stay close to the ground but we re always in a hurry now and if i could make this world spin a little slower then i would then we could grow a little closer i think we re getting closer i think we re getting closer33","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"he s the one who makes the sun shine he s the one that puts the moon in the sky he s the one who hung the stars one by one he s the one who makes the birds sing
