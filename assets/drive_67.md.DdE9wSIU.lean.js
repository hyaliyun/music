for the day when history stops and time suspends spending eternity in fellowship that never ends we see the greatest expression of god s love extended in that moment when those who were once enemies instead became god s friends and when it s my time to go go ahead and take me home i know i ll be with you i know i ll be with you when it is my time to go go ahead and take me home nowhere that i d rather go i wanna be with you how sweet the gospel sounds to ears like mine well acquainted with pain and strained relationships friendships that suffer from long distances or even worse they get severed from something more severe and he still hasn t wiped away all my tears yet my cheeks get wet every now and then even when i give my best i know i fall short i get scared when the ball s in my court focused on my performance wretched and poor it makes the message more real when i preach it i m not there yet so i m reaching reaching for a goal to stand before my king and be speechless then never again will i question if his grace is sufficient to cover my sin cause death is gone and all the effects of evil and wrong will be conquered when his kingdom comes so this is my hope and my prayer the air that i ll breathe in eternity with lungs that never fail me if it pleases my lord and only by your grace use my life til it s poured out for your sake until then i ll remain where you have me with joy when i feel unhappy and a peace that surpasses all my understanding my life is in the hands of your love everlasting  and when it s my time to go go ahead and take me home i know i ll be with you i know i ll be with you when it is my time to go go ahead and take me home nowhere that i d rather go i wanna be with you and when it s my time to go go ahead and take me home i know i ll be with you i know i ll be with you when it is my time to go go ahead and take me home nowhere that i d rather go i wanna be with you2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i don t suppose you have a moment

of death give me rest if my heart stops then it don t hurt no more can t get worse no more can t pursue all these desires it ain t cursed no more no more lies about my worth no more i understand the thoughts of suicide that do reside but when i stop and think about my family i feel new inside i promised i would die a thousand deaths fore i cause them any pain but somehow i end up killing everything i cry for you if you feel a dark twisted heart wrenching hate to see your own reflection praying for an intervention feeling guilt and feeling shame i just call on jesus name praying daily can you take away this pain take the thorn away still it remains i feel the same i know that i m here but still feel insane satan would love to see me give up and throw up my hands he say i m guilty

feelin like a phony oh i cry for you i would die for you to escape the pain i feel from all that i ve been through i feel it in my soul and in my chest take away this ugly thorn inside my flesh give me death but grace is sufficient to start my mission i m so far from perfect can t believe they listen but hear a broken man til your healin happens and hear a liar tell you truth to bring you gladness i could never boast in my accomplishments i can only hope in god with confidence opposite of optimist u and i are consonants broken all the vowels deservin of every consequence will you cry for me or will you judge me will you throw stones at my head or will you love me i could never be everything that you wanna see but crooked sticks draw straight lines just look at me this thorn in my

in bed flickin smokes in an open piss bottle i dropped like twenty pounds in a week goin through withdrawals i always said addiction s a flaw of the weak obviously my addiction it was stronger than me cause man i hit rock bottom heavy fuckin hard my mother said she found me convulsing and held me in her arms my love left me at my worst point bailed when i fell last words to me i should be ashamed of myself that last week of my demise the damn needles i took a thousand would you have come to my funeral and put me down then i almost died multiple times in a week so how can you live with yourself when you re tryin to sleep to know i could be so close to dyin lyin in peace would you still just think of yourself if i was deceased and yeah i got aggressive in my blackout state and i ain t sayin now that that s okay we were so in love romancin you refused to give me another chance then what happened to your best quality bein understandin i love you you re hatin me it crushed me then it bugged you people judged you for datin me now it s no forgiveness for a past side i ve shown to women with you you know its different you should stick to your own opinion our only time together on house arrest hate this shit there s supposed to be so much more to this relationship can t even look in a fuckin mirror to see my face in it i ve sat in the dark with a knife to my throat craziness and still you would try to mess with me you really wanna push it with my suicidal tendencies if i died would you cry why are you and i enemies i press my palms into my eyes and picture you beside me

though i am completely self destructive and i m sorry it d never happen again my mind s gone for that span of time don t know what was happenin then if i was that crazy baby i d be glad i was dead i m sorry you said you felt like you d never see your family again and i don t blame you you were great you should be proud what i was goin through it s insane you could put me down exes that i ve ruined and crushed have called to see i m movin up when you ain t even asked me how i m fuckin doin once and i hear what you re sayin close ear to the ground when i needed you most you nowhere to be found if you really were my girl you would ve been supportive with true love it s true love you shouldn t have to force it cause i believed in you my heart fuckin bleeds for you where the fuck is your precense when i really fuckin needed you towards the end drugs removed my soul i am embarrassed you were there to see me lose control so where you the love of my life or just some stupid ho i guess now you re just somebody that i used to know for now but i will be back and i am across the country bettering my life i transferred my conditions here and you know i m bettering my life and don t let people get inside your head and convince you cause i m such a fuckin terrible person that i must have been terrible to you and tricked you you know me as an amazing man cause that s exactly what i was to you straight up i love you i miss you and now the whole world knows i m sorry and this one s for my dawg man as an ex addict bruce when i met you you was clean as a judge no reason for drugs and surrounded yourself with people you loved when we first started to click yeah we partied a bit who knew we d reach that point where it d be harder and harder to quit the first night i met your brother keeps replayin with me the character i embodied was smooth i was dangerous see the genius on drugs so cool you was hangin with me he didn t know that i influenced you negatively so when he seen us chillin we was kings he was proud it breaks my heart to think of what he probably thinks of me now so with this i m just reflectin i m constantly recollectin i got a younger brother too bruce but you never met him and he seen my darkness said i don t got any good left but even then he still wanna be followin in my footsteps and i betrayed em all people who loved me to my core my sister s always had my back she doesn t anymore so i look at my arm and the marks of needle penetration cause the people who fuckin love me it leave em devastated i guess we both got worse when you was outta control but then i was sittin in prison bro so how could i know and goin through withdrawls in a prison cell livin hell i know that feeling of pain when you really wish you could kill yourself i accepted it happened be there a long time they say every dog gets its day i guess i got mine i hit my house arrest bail lucky i know when we spoke some time later it s been crushin my soul i love you hollo bruce i always got love for you bro that was the last thing i said as i fuckin hung up the phone found out the next day enraged smashin walls twenty five too young for a fuckin man to fall i wish i said somethin more when you hadda called a fuckin hour later and you were dead in a bathroom stall why do we just enjoy it why do we love the posion you should ve went out on a throne bro not a fuckin toilet my blood is boilin at the thought of it bruce you give yourself too much credit for how your tolerance grew when you feelin low on life and needed that confidence boost i ll take lines in your name if they say it s what you wanted to do and i never understood but as of recent i knew cause i was a needle or two away from bein with you and i m sorry for the times that i was freakin out when you were with me especially that time i lost my mind while drivin through the city i wanted to honor your memory and swear off shootin quickly a year past i m still doin the same shit bruce forgive me i almost had my body into soft dirt i swore i d get better but homie it got a lot worse and i was in that same weak place so i couldn t fight for you at your memorial high on the same shit that took your life from you i guess your father blamed me to people at the bar i didn t hear it directly it s like i seen it from a far i told whatevski there was somethin that i needed from his car i cried for you brother and stuck another needle in my arm i know i know it s fucked up ain t it friends don t know how to help so that subject changes my parents is embarrassed is an understatement it s just amazin i can function with all the drugs i ve taken but yo i m gonna stop though bruce i ain t ready to die yet g through your friendship and your death it s inspired me i need to wake the fuck up now man find my dreams conquer goals and become everything we said we d try to be the tat of your names on the ribs on my side so to know i ll keep you close to my heart that fills me with pride and i

world s a bit amiss and the lights go down across the trailer park i get down i feel had i feel on the verge of going mad and then it s time to punch the clock i put on some make up and turn on the tape deck and put the wig back on my head suddenly i m miss midwest midnight checkout queen until i head home and i put myself to bed i look back on where i m from look at the woman i ve become and the strangest things seem suddenly routine i look up from my vermouth on the rocks a gift wrapped wig still in the box of towering velveteen i put on some make up some lavern baker and pull the wig down from the shelf suddenly i m miss beehive 1963 until i wake up and i turn back to myself some girls they got natural ease they wear it any way they please with their french flip curls and perfumed magazines wear it up let it down this is the best way that i ve found to be the best you ve ever seen i put on some make up turn on the eight track i m pulling the  wig down from the shelf suddenly i m miss farrah fawcett from tv until i wake up and i turn back to myself shag bi level bob dorothy hamill do sausage curls chicken wings it s all because of you with your blow dried feather backed toni home wave too flip fro frizz flop it s all because of you it s all because of you it s all because of you okay everyone it s my favorite part of the song the sing a long where i get to hear you sing

star of stage and screen and i ain t never i m never turning back","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"what the hell are musicals it appears to be a play where the dialogue stops and the plot is conveyed through song through song yes wait wait wait so an actor is saying his lines and then out of nowhere he just starts singing yes well that is the stupidest thing that i have ever heard you re doing a play got something to say so you sing it it s absurd who on earth is going to sit there while an actor breaks into song what possible thought could the audience think other than this is horribly wrong remarkably they won t think that seriously why not  because it s a musical a musical and nothing s as amazing as a musical with song and dance and sweet romance and happy endings happening by happenstance bright lights stage fights and a dazzling chorus you wanna be great then you gotta create a musical i don t know i find it hard to believe people would actually pay to see something like this let s just say it s a saturday night and you wanna go out on the town got a lady to flatter who might give it up if you don t let her down you could go see a tragedy but that wouldn t be very fun or a play from greek mythology see a mother have sex with her son eeeewww you could go see a drama with all of that trauma and pain or go see something more relaxing and less taxing on the brain go see a musical a musical a poppy piece releasing all your blues icals where crooners croon ahh a catchy tune and limber legged ladies thrill you till you swoon ooh s ahh s big applause and a standing ovation the future is bright if you could just write a musical some make you happy some make you sad some are quite big some quite small some are too long some are just plays with song ahh some musicals have no talking at all no talking at all that s right there s no talking all of the dialog is sung in a very dramatic fashion um really yes really there s no talk there s no talking and they often stay on one note for a very long time so that when they change to a different note you notice and it s supposed to create a dramatic effect but mostly you just sit there asking yourself why aren t they talking sounds miserable i believe it s pronounced misÂ¨Â¦rables and people actually like this no they love it and what s not to love it s such a delight there s nothing quite like a musical ooh another vision i haven t even told you the best part yet feel that fascinating rhythm move into your feet uh what is that feel your ass gyrating to that titillating beat ooh are you ok you slap your lap then finger snap that s when you know it s time to tap what the hell are you doing now it s called a dance break apparently this happens in musicals as well people on stage just burst into spontaneous dance why does it advance the plot no advance character not necessarily then why do it because it s entertaining 5 6 7 8 another vision it s a musical what do you talk what do you talk it s a musical a seussical no a musical with girls on stage a musical we ve got snappy repartee and the women are risquÂ¨Â¦ and the chorus boys are kinda gay a musical a true blue new musical stand back it s a musical some musicals are very serious a big glittering musical a musical it s a mu si cal for us a big and shiny mighty fine y glitter glitz and chorus line y bob your head and shake your heiney musical it s a musical it s a musical it is a musical it s a musical yes i get it now we ll do a musical no kidding a musical what could be more amazing than a musical with song and dance and sweet romance and with a musical we might have half a chance ooh s ahh s big applause with everyone cheering for us and for some unexplainable reason the crowd goes wild every time when dancers kick in unison in one big wonderful line and then you got yourself a musical a musical a la la la la la la la palooz ical with flashy style and a big fake smile a snazzy band some jazzy hands i swear that i ll cross my heart hope to die if it isn t a doozy take it from me they ll be flocking to see your star lit won t quit big hit musical a big hit
