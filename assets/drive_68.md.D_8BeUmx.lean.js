treacherous turn a man is weak but the spirit yearns to keep on course from the bow to the stern and to throw overboard every selfish concern that tries to work for what can t be earned sometimes the only way to return is to go where the winds will take you and to let go of all you cannot hold onto for the hope beyond the blue yellow and gold as the new day dawns like a virgin unveiled who waited so long to dance and rejoice and to sing her song and to rest in the arms of a love so strong no one comes unless they re drawn by the voice of desire that leads em along to the redemption of what went wrong by the blood that covered the innocent one no more separation between us so lift your voice just one more time if there s any hope may it be a sign that everything was made to shine despite what you can see so take this bread and drink this wine and hide your spirit in the vine where all things will work by a good design for those who will believe and let go of all we cannot hold onto

fifteen when he immigrated from japan he he he worked until he was able to buy to actually build a store let me tell you a story in the form of a dream i don t know why i have to tell it but i know what it means close your eyes just picture the scene as i paint it for you it was world war ii when this man named kenji woke up ken was not a soldier he was just a man with a family who owned a store in l a that day he crawled out of bed like he always did bacon and eggs with wife and kids he lived on the second floor of a little store he ran he moved to l a from japan they called him immigrant in japanese he d say he was called issei that meant first generation in the united states when everybody was afraid of the germans afraid of the japs but most of all afraid of a homeland attack and that morning when ken went out on the doormat his world went black cause right there front page news three weeks before 1942 pearl harbor s been bombed and the japs are coming pictures of soldiers dying and running ken knew what it would lead to and just like he guessed the president said the evil japanese in our home country would be locked away they gave ken a couple of days to get his whole life packed in two bags just two bags he couldn t even pack his clothes and some folks didn t even have a suitcase to pack anything in so two trash bags is all they gave them and when the kids asked mom where are we going nobody even knew what to say to them ken didn t wanna lie he said the u s is looking for spies so we have to live in a place called manzanar where a lot of japanese people are stop it don t look at the gunmen you don t wanna get the soldiers wondering if you re gonna run or not cause if you run then you might get shot other than that try not to think about it try not to worry bout it being so crowded cause someday we ll get out someday someday  yeah soon as war broke out the fbi came and they just come through the house and you have to come all the japanese have to go they took mr ni the people couldn t understand why they had to take him because he s an innocent laborer so now they re in a town with soldiers surrounding them every day every night looked down at them from watchtowers up on the wall ken couldn t really hate them at all they were just doing their job and he wasn t gonna make any problems he had a little garden vegetables and fruits that he gave to the troops in a basket his wife made but in the back of his mind he wanted his family s life saved prisoners of war in their own damn country what for and time passed in the prison town he wondered if he d live it down if and when they were free the only way out was joining the army and supposedly some men went out for the army signed on and ended up flying to japan with a bomb that fifteen kiloton blast put an end to the war pretty fast two cities were blown to bits the end of the war came quick and ken got out big hopes of a normal life with his kids and his wife but then they got back to their home and what they saw made him feel so alone these people had trashed every room smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors written on the walls and the floor japs not welcome anymore and kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside he looked at his wife without words to say she looked back at him wiping tears away and said someday we ll be okay someday now the names have been changed but the story is true my family was locked up back in 42 my family was there where it was dark and damp and they called it an internment camp when we first got back from camp

people already tryin to get me gone tellin me to quit rapping just play the keys that my band had a singer they didn t need me but my band had my back so we did the tracks put out the album and the talk went flat it was funny at first but then the humor faded when some magazines printed that our label made us we were to be good to be true some were saying ghost writers were writing all that we do so we had to disprove it we spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we re making this music after that i made it a rule i only do e mail responses to print interviews because these people love to put a twist to your words to infer that you said something fucking absurd oh did i lose you at infer not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words people used to infer that we were manufactured now i ve got the interviews on file which people said what which number to dial so now every enemy screaming insanity all they re ever gonna be s another big fan of me

he wrote besides the fact that he wanted me to just play keyboard or whatever he didn t want me to rap he was like maybe joe hahn should um wear a lab coat and a cowboy hat on st like when we play i

your voice is too weak to speak neighbors and strangers are dying beside you their decaying bodies you re tied to cling tight to your fight for survival wonder if your tribe will ever try to find you arrive somewhere strange the air is cold you can see your breath and you re barely clothed your first time ever seeing snow sleeping next to it on a hard dirt floor go from can t seeing see in the morning to can t see at night you work till your hands bleed white your native language you can t recite murdered on sight if you try to read or write when you bend all of your life and can t see the light it get s painful to stand upright right and your eyes bear the sight of your wife being being pulled out your shack and brutalized at night you only taste joy when babies are born which becomes an occasion to mourn separated torn from your celebrating arms then as quickly as they came they were gone sold away from your farm this is all they ve known never heard stories from home they forget your name the culture from which you came teaching it ll get you slain praying to your god will get you the same tortured to near death lest you complain no choice left you sing through the pain and pray that your suffering wasn t in vain end of your chain end of your life your grandchildren born with no end in sight so you muster up all of your might and your last breath comes out this is

realize now that the cost was our soul got me feeling like an empty shell prison guard that inherited a cell i m desperate to find my place emptiness lies behind my face flowers only die in a vase a heart only dies encased in a lie we call race i hear the song but i can t sing along something s really wrong i can t put my finger on terrified to admit it s wrong cause i m hiding in the ruins of a legacy that still lives on our identity is hinged upon the miserable myth we ve been taught since we re born until we mend what was torn the debt of a sin lingers long after the vicitim s moans this

and said she doesn t live here anymore but he offered to give me the address that they were forwarding her letters to i just took it and returned to the cabbie and said i got one more fare for you and so we rolled back into the city up to a five story old brownstone i rang the bell that had her name on the mailbox the buzzer said somebody s home  and the look on her face as she opened the door was like an old joke told by a friend it d taken ten more years but she d found her smile and i watched the corners start to bend and she said how are you harry haven t we played this scene before i said it s so good to see you sue had to play it out just once more play it out just once more she said i ve heard you flying high on my radio i answered it s not all it seems that s when she laughed and she said it s better sometimes when we don t get to touch our dreams that s when i asked her where was that actress she said that was somebody else and then i asked her why she looked so happy now she said i finally like myself at last i like myself so we talked all through that afternoon talking about where we d been we talked of the tiny difference between ending and starting to begin we talked cause talking tells you things like what you really are thinking about but sometimes you can t find what you re feeling til all the word run out so i asked her to come to the concert she said no i work at night i said we ve gotten too damn good at leaving sue she said harry you re right don t ask me if i made love to her or which one of us started to cry don t ask me why she wouldn t take the money that i left if i answered at all i d lie so i thought about her as i sang that night and of how the circle keeps rolling around how i act as i m facing the footlights and how she s flying with

thorns that life entails he said sit tall in the saddle hold your head up high keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky and live like you ain t afraid to die and don t be scared just enjoy your ride well i know some day farther down the road i ll come to the edge of the great unknown there ll stand a black horse riderless and i wonder if i m ready for this so i ll saddle him up and he

bodies beautifully fitted the comfort was abundant fluttering as unity was gifted interest twisted us closer to melanin touch my lips kissed your nape shaping lovely adrenaline rush sentiments clutched you closely juxtaposed horizontal launching me along the constellations astronomical distances my fingertips passionately paint your curves cause my heart s perception is beyond any

the mystery that is you views i hold true much ado blissfully as i m now longing for the warmth of your embrace will i make it back to planet earth or drift to outer space i grace orbits of emotion

over double pump lattes and low fat muffins do i or is missing what we had out of the question i m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson i got flows for the marilyn monroes who was there before it all i guess that s how it goes they hear about your cons but focus on your pros and love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul but those same ones from your area will grow into women that are ready to get married at hello because of what they allowed where are they all now i know they re somewhere watching so i m trying to make them proud searching for the meaning you ll find it next to me they tell me i m the hottest guess we finally get to see i m feeling like nas who am i to disagree they say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key that s probably why i m in this bitch shining jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded and the bandwagon s full but you can try and run behind it i m sorry poolside drinking margarita rounds shout out to my city though i hardly be in town i m the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down i m in a world where things are taken never given how long they choose to love you will never be your decision and i m aware that this could be the last time you listen so while i m still
