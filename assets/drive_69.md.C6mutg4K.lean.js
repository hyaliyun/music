far and wide when it comes to surprises in the moonlit night i excel without ever even trying with the slightest little effort of my ghost like charms i have seen grown men give out a shriek with the wave of my hand and a well placed moan i have swept the very bravest off their feet yet year after year it s the same routine and i grow so weary of the sound of screams and i jack the pumpkin king have grown so tired of the same old thing oh somewhere deep inside of these bones an emptiness began to grow there s something out there far from my home a longing that i ve never known i m a master of fright and a demon of light and i ll scare you right out of your pants to a guy in kentucky i m mister unlucky and i m known throughout england and france and since i am dead i can take off my head to recite shakespearean quotations no animal nor man can scream like i can with the fury of my recitations but who here would ever understand that the pumpkin king with the skeleton grin would tire of his crown if they only understood he would give it all up if he only could oh there s an empty place in my bones that calls out for something unknown the fame and praise come year after year does nothing for these empty tears2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night discos don t open till

rock the house but in the day time the streets were clear you couldn t find a good freak anywhere cause the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night now when freaks get dressed to go out at night they like to wear leather jackets chains and spikes they wear rips and zippers all in their shirts real tight pants and fresh mini skirts all kinds of colors runnin through their hair and you could just about spot a freak anywhere but then again you could know someone all their life but might not know they re a freak unless you see them at night cause the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night now the party s jumpin the place is packed and when the crowd s like this i m ready to rap but before i could bust a rhyme on the mic freaks are all over me like white on rice freaks come in all shapes sizes and colors but what i like about em most is that they re real good lovers they do it in the park they do it in the dark but most freaks are known for breakin hearts you could never tell what a freak was thinkin of and you may never catch a freak without at least one glove and they don t walk when they step they strut and nine times out of ten they drive you nuts but take my advice you don t stand a chance freaks are so bad they got their own dance so if you wanna live a nice quiet life do yourself a favor don t come out at night cause  the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night hut one hut two hut hut hut the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night the freaks come out at night1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"if there s
