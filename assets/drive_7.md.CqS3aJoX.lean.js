them up on soundcloud datpiff or fakeshoredrive com top 101 mick jenkinsmick is the definition of an anomaly his beat selection is unconventional his lyricism is of a different nature complex to say the least and his hooks while at times awkward have another aura surrounding them his voice is simply captivating which makes his flow even more unique he can opt for a slower more gritty flow to hit you in the chest but also holds onto the reigns when speeding up the pace on such tracks like ongaud and thempeople are some great producers who really shine when working with mick and help him create his sound he has a few tapes out that are all worth checking out which i covered in my one hype post on him and his crew but the two that stand above the rest are without a doubt trees truths and the water\\\\ top 5 tapes the last two years for me respectively 2 noname gypsynoname has it all her are great conscious and clever without being preachy corny or annoying she can pull of a serious somber experimental song and make a poppy ass song thats not as serious and then combine the 2 and make a serious song thats extremely poppy sounding her wordplay is very good for someone just getting into rap like she is her flow is very solid my only complaint is that shes very inconsistent when it comes to features although her lost verse is one of my favorites on that tape no tape as of yet but telefone comes soon i put together a compilation tape of her songs so far but it is missing a few songs it can be found in my previous hype post 3 nico segal donnie trumpetnico segal in one word poetry his background in spoken word shines through his music not only in flow but also in his on top of being a good rapper hes also an amazing trumpet player he has 2 tapes out 1 under the alias of donnie trumpet and one under nico segal called illasoul shades of blue both of which i highly recommend very very good tapes he s releasing surf this year next year with the social experiment band 4 martin kymartin ky is a one man dream team he produces his own tracks does his own hooks and raps and everything about him is great his flow is great and his voice is great his beats are diverse ranging from cloud type to very trap influenced even some boom bap type of sounds i cant give martin justice with words you just need to check out steam along with all the other jams on his soundcloud he has a few mixtapes eps out but the only tape that you can find on the internet is timeless with the production credits mostly given to martin his next project the everywhere but here ep is scheduled to drop in early 2015 5 lucki eck one of the most unique artists ive heard in a long time if i could put a sub genre to his music itd be cloud trap if that doesnt excite you it should its so unique and the beats he chooses vary not only that but it seems like lucki is always changing up his style at least with his new single all senses where hes just spitting over a weird ass beat then he has songs where its just straight up cloud rap like boomin i dont even know how to describe songs like count on me ii he has a really interesting almost nonexistent flow he just talks to you and stunts on you in a way that makes it seem like it s just natural to him it doesn t sound like he s forcing it he s not flexing on you to cover up insecurities he s just naturally that way and 100 believes he s the boss he has alternative trap that came out in 2013 and was an amazing tape and he has body high that came out this year that i haven t been able to put down check him out extremely unique and worthy of all the attention he can get 6 alex wileyas someone that was just ok with club wiley holy shit village party blew me away i ve been keeping my eye on alex wiley for a long time and i can honestly say i didn t expect village party to be as good as it was it was crazy fun had it s hilarious moments production was honestly some of the best this year and alex can rap his ass off he has an abstract way of songwriting that isn t just verse hook verse he ll just rip a song straight through and creates the structure as it goes the flows on village party and even club wiley are great the lyricism is surprisingly good and every feature on the project killed it it s hard not to vibe with village party 7 via rosagreat singer who can create an amazing vibe that s easy to get into her project deathvialove is littered with great rappers over these ambient soundscapes by thempeople as well as her amazing singing thempeople s signature sound is obvious throughout the project their drums are top notch and the way they can set the mood is great highly worth checking out 8 leather corduroysraw i d even go as far as to say raw as fuck some of the most passionate 15 minutes you ll listen to this year is on their ep pmvii it starts off with an acid trip fueled freestyle from one of the 2 guys in this group kami from there it just gets more and more passionate and energetic joey purp s delivery on this project is out of this world highly recommended to anyone who wants more passion in their raps seasons coming out new years 9 hurt everybodylike i said innovation is these guys strongsuit you d be hard pressed finding someone who can make the default iphone ringtone sound like a banger supa and carl give some amazing verses all over their self titled project and supa s voice on hooks is addicting it might be hard to get into them sometimes but when you like them you fucking love them they re honestly great and very underrated 10 sabapivot gang s own saba has been quietly blowing up over the past year he s slowly been getting more and more mentions in high profile places saba knows how to craft a song he knows how his own voice and flow fits over a beat and if he can t find a beat that he likes he ll make his own and it ll sound 100x better saba s passion and delivery are matched only by a select few not only that but he doesn t let his passionate delivery overshadow his lyricism he will make sure you know that the shit he s talking isn t bullshit he s talking about some real make sure to grab comfortzone his new tape because it was amazing through and through his first tape in 2012 getcomfortable was really good too but it s obvious that in the past 2 years saba s found his sound honorable mention the o my syes that s right a whole section for the o my s that s how much i love them they re a soul band out of chicago that does a lot of rap collabs alongside their solo music maceo the lead singer has a really really unique raspy voice that really echoes and emphasizes his emotions really really well the acoustics instrumentals on all their tapes are really high quality sounding and very intimate they ve also done a few features like noname gypsy s sometimes and more popularly ab souls these days they know how to make a really happy song like my house and a very beautiful and somber song like simply beautiful which is amazing to me try out some of these tracks bout a dolla ft twista chuck inglish chip tha ripper chance the rapper the wonder years ft chance the rapper precious light ft zion dally auston zack wicks mystic pussy ft iceface glc dally auston they have a few tapes out that are all worth checking out imo a humble masterpiece as well as potty mouth ep chicago style both of which are on their soundcloud in their entirety they have features from some hip hop legends as well as a lot of local acts probably my favorite soul band that i ve heard in the past decade here are some of my favorites by them that don t have any rap collabs on them cough drop sweet love simply beautiful smoke killa my house i also highly highly recommend their audiotree set found here one of my favorite audiotree

my day cuz i can t even listen to the words that i say cause every time i pick up a pen its still you and there beside me in my mirror all i can see is us two the pages turn so fast and like all old pages do the words they bleed through the words they bleed through rough woah i swear you never really miss it till its half gone and you tighten up your grip trying to hold on didn t really appreciate it when its in your arms and you can relate to every word in your song like was i wrong but i know i m right but in hindsight i blame the limelight maybe i just needed time to get my mind right maybe we ll reconnect when the times right i m trying to think about the causes was i too bossy exactly what the cause is i was told to step in love with some caution cuz love and shit is no difference in the darkness ha but love is where the heart is and you can see the blood as it dripping trough the gauzes so i guess i fell out of love with her smile and more in love with applauses its quiet in my house your silence is my home and everything reminds me that i am all alone its quiet where you used to be and now that youre gone its not a sound is not a word but a dial tone well it s quiet when i m drinking its quiet when i smoke its when i m eating oh and i sleep all alone its quiet now it was louder then i stand still like a stone only from my dreams you won t go cause every time i pick up a pen its all you and there beside me in my mirror all i can see is us two the pages turn so fast and like all old pages do the words they bleed through the words they bleed through rough woah how did i get in this predicament was i influenced by the bennefits cuz i was hitting on so many chichis loving you and leaving you was the only sentiment but i guess i wasn t ready for you cuz i m rubbing your feet cooking spagheti for you taking you to parks winning teddies for you but in my heart i m thinking there s someone better for you but my hearts like no not this again cut it out blach you know how this ll end and i swear that i really was listenning but my was yelling and my heart was just whispering so your know who i listened to now my hearts bitching cuz he s missing you get my eyes staring at some old flitchs of you and my nose swear that still smells the scent of you and my soul s saying damm she was meant for you why won t you come back i m losing past of

never got laid and was constantly razzed oh poor little kid it bothered me probably more so because i was horny and frequently had to make up stories like uh when i went on vacation i met this chick and we fucked and she loved it etcetera etcetera this typical pubescent problem was in effect during the height of my problems with my father and stepmom you know the typical wicked stepmom story and so i moved to both grandparents and four sets of aunts and uncles and so forth and so on within the year and in eighth grade my mom had no choice to take me in because my dad packed my stuff and drove me to her house in the morning and left me there she was pissed i accumulated quite a healthy complex not to mention the complexion then one day i discovered the most ultimate form of expression ever marijuana oh boy pot i could escape all day long and not have the routine nervous breakdowns once a week only being stoned for the first few times was what i claimed as something i would do for the rest of my life and i would practically do anything to ensure my supply of the fantastic weed trevor was a guy i hated but resorted to becoming friends with because he was the only person i could get pot from he was the kingpin trevor ace john and derren all white trash lowlife scums of the earth according to the jocks had been going to this girl s house after school and they invited me we got to the door and a very fat girl let us in it wasn t obvious to me for over an hour that this girl seemed kind of quiet until one of the guys pointed out that she was in a special ed class i m sure a lot of kids would call her a retard and some just slow and at the time and still to this day i would call her quiet and illiterate but not retarded the object of the guys who had be going there for the past month was to steal booze from the downstairs basement den of her house while others distracted her by opening covers and doors and pretending to eat all the food one would go down and take a fifth and then exit out the downstairs so we d do this routine every otherday and got away with it for oh about a month and during that month it happened to be the epitome of my mental abuse from my mother it turned out that pot didn t help me escape my troubles too well anymore and i was actually enjoying doing rebellious things like stealing booze and busting store windows and and nothing ever mattered i decided within the next month i ll not sit on my roof and think about jumping but i ll actually kill myself and i wasn t going out from this world without actually knowing what it was like to get laid so one day after school i went to the girl s house alone and invited myself in and she offered me some twinkies and i sat on her lap and i said let s fuck and i touched her tits and she went into her bedroom and got undressed in front of me and i watched and realised that it was actually happening so i tried to fuck her but i didn t know how and i asked her if she had ever done this before and she said a lot of times mainly with her cousin i got grossed out very heavily with how her vagina smelled and her sweat reeked so i left my conscience grew to where i couldn t go to school for a week and when i went back i got in house suspension for skipping and that day the girl s father came in and screaming and accusing someone of taking advantage of his daughter and so during lunch a rumour started and by the next day everyone was waiting for me to yell and cuss and spit at me and callin me the retard fucker i couldn t handle the ridicule so i got high and drunk and walked down to the train tracks and laid down and put two big pieces of cement on my chest and legs and i waited for the eleven o clock train and the train came closer and closer and closer and it went on the next track besides me instead of over me the tension from school had an effect on me and so i couldn t attend the school anymore and the train scared me enough to try to rehabilitate myself and my my lifting weights and mathematics seemed to be improving so i became less manically depressed but still haven t had any friends because i i hated everyone for they were so
