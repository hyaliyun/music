the season she s taken in a young summer s youth i stole her away from her mother and sister though close did they stay each one of them suffering from the failures of their day with strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us of the two sisters i loved the young with sensitive instincts she was the creative one their constant scrapegoat she was easily undone by the jealousy of others around her for her parasite sister i had no respect bound by her boredom her pride to protect countless visions of the other she d reflect as a crutch for her scenes and her society myself for what i did i cannot be excused the changes i was going through can t even be used for the lies that i told her in hope not to lose the could be dream lover of my lifetime with unseen consciousness i possessed in my grip a magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped noticing not that i d already slipped to the sin of love s false security from silhouetted anger to manufactured peace answers of emptiness voice vacancies til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please what s wrong what s exactly the matter  and so it did happen like it could have been foreseen the timeless explosion of fantasy s dream at the peak of the night the king and the queen tumbled all down into pieces the tragic figure her sister did shout leave her alone god damn you get out and i in my armor turning about and nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound her sister and i in a screaming battleground and she in between the victim of sound soon shattered as a child to the shadows all is gone all is gone admit it take flight i gagged in contradiction tears blinding my sight my mind it was mangled i ran into the night leaving all of love s ashes behind me the wind knocks my window the room it is wet the words to say i m sorry i haven t found yet i think of her often and hope whoever she s met will be fully aware of how precious she is ah my friends

both got flattened by the batmobile but before it could make it back to the batcave abraham lincoln popped out of his grave and took an ak 47 out from under his hat and blew batman away with a rat a

shaq came back covered in a tire track but jackie chan jumped out and landed on his back and batman was injured and trying to get steady when abraham lincoln came back with a machete but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped indiana jones took him out with his whip then he saw godzilla sneaking up from behind and he reached for his gun which he just couldn t find cause batman stole it and he shot and he missed and jackie chan deflected it with his fist then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault while abraham lincoln tried to pole vault onto optimus prime but they collided

watch yourself as you literally decay i ve seen myself fall apart more than i d like to admit sometimes almost like a standby watching everything that i once loved come crashing down and fall at my feet but i think the worst part was that i felt nothing not even sadness or guilt or anything that reminded me of being human i was numb to everything and everyone i had lost the only part of me that could still feel and yet i continued to push you away maybe i thought it d bring peace or some kind of feeling back in my life but when you chase out all of the light in your life you also let the dark replace it i never thought that i d see the day as i watch myself destroy the better part of me cutting off what i lack hoping that it would bring some sort of clarity seeking what life would be

caught in the in between and forever means forever and that s what it ll always mean and life is a reality except for when it s a dream and those are the moments that i can t seem to think but i make

love to pretend but prior to then love was nothing more to me than a vacation a vacant motivation to avoid the means it takes to reach any real end a sense of salvation but also an element of bitter hope to cope with the rope that was tied around my neck and the savior i hoped for was chased away way back then when i found vices to take the place of all the things i wanted to be and i lost sight of me but i was told i could be anybody and i thought i could find purpose in loving someone who looks like me and i began dreaming or sinking most nights they meant the same thing and when that salvation finally found me it was traded away for thirty pieces of silver seems like that s not too much i guess but i sold my savior for a whole lot less my two best friends acceptance and a mirage

love but it was just another season that would end with leaves falling into mud so we found ourselves in a new world where we would have to live out a fear and call it living by faith a journey of forgetting who we are so we can remember our place and we tried to read maps backwards to lead us back to the beginning of the journey the only place we could walk hand in hand and not feel so lonely then those maps of tangled lines became our footprints in sinking sand we re being washed away by waves of trusting each other to feel complete but they came up short until we both felt alone and empty with no breadcrumbs laid down to lead us back to safety we thought this was built to last until we died but even that doesn t mean forever at least not in my mind i trust in my ability to love more than i trusted love and i trusted your smile as your emotions not a mask to cover up your hand scooping up buckets of blood we would travel far and see many new things and we believed we could be anything as long as we had each other but the bother came when another stayed long enough to give you the feeling i did when this journey began and now our hands are completely stained red as we journey to see new country roads connected to the broken dreams of simple families the roads lined with animals waiting for their turn at the slaughter reality on the roads we see and a metaphor for our sons and daughters cause the blood on our hands was the only way to keep the root of our love watered and we have nothing to believe in but we still wanted to die like martyrs and when someone came to carry me on this journey the blood of our past flooding our beliefs i watched someone come along and part the red sea but even on dry land i couldn t breathe because my body built an immunity to your apathy and that s all i needed to believe love was still the reason i could stand on my own two feet scream hallelujah until you cough up blood i inhaled this world for so long i tore out my lungs i tore out my lungs i tore out my lungs","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"sometimes i feel like some sort of gold being i m some sort of metal that only has purpose when someone needs something and people wouldn t chase after me if it wasn t for greed if it wasn t for the purchasing of some sort of peace and my hopes and dreams are put on display for all to see but under heat they bend and they bleed and maybe you couldn t tell this was once beautiful it s pure gold just covered in black ink covered in the charcoal remains of ashes from the last time someone burned me but baby i can be something you need so bend me in that fire until i fit a shape that can offer you some sort of utility cause i can see you but i can t touch you and i can touch you but i can t feel you and i can feel you but i can t see you i used to but then i went blind mend me into a cup so when you get too drunk you will think of me or mend me into a ring or some sort of jewelry so i can hold some sort of diamond within me people won t notice me but will see i possess something with beauty make me into buckles for the shoes on your feet so when you run away from this broken down street you can take me with you when you chase your dream or make me into a music box so when i am opened people can feel enlightened make me into a trophy so someone can hold me high as they boast to the sky that they don t need anything or make me into a medallion a true sign of victory not as flashy as a trophy so it possesses some dignity make me into a locket that you can wear around your neck so i can possess a picture of the man who made you feel the best or at least better than i ever did cause i can touch you but i can t see you and i can see you but i can t feel you well i can feel you but i can t touch you i used to but then you left my life you re not one to look for gold or any sort of monetary value and that s why i ll always love you that s why i ll always love you so don t make me into anything you might lose please just don t make me into another excuse just make me feel like me so i can make you feel like you i can feel you i can touch you i can t see you where have you gone just don t make me into another excuse just make me into something that you can use just make me feel like me so i can make you feel like you cause i can feel you but i can t see you and i can see you but i can t touch you and i can touch you but i can t feel you all i can feel is that your love makes me feel alive4","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i sat down with her and she told me her story and i told her i loved her and i just wanted to support her through her recovery and through conversations i listened and i feel like this is the best way to interpret what she told me the devil found a clever way to infiltrate and bring his manipulation a slender blonde in a cocktail dress struggling through the intoxication brought on by the gifting of drinks until she was ready to pay back in the bedroom in search to appease the demons in her head on a sterile surface in the bathroom looking into a half cracked half filthy mirror hoping she doesn t reflect that half cracked half filthy receding stain of a smile her mother made when she left because the promises she made to herself seem to be the hardest ones to keep and knowing she survived the last storm was no longer all she needed to be able to fall asleep vacant wine glasses and late night crashes symbolic of her vessel with no presentation at the pallet but a spirit starving for remembrance some sort of legacy other than her occupation because her normal skin looked like silk but had been masked by vengeance baggage under her eyes deep within her overcompensating lies and all she saw when she gazed into the endless skies was regret from that manipulation this life of sleeping through the static of practice for the everlasting rush she hoped for she was somewhat ecstatic but not for the first time because she was reminiscent of those times that she would have those late night drives those moments when she would look back and say how did i get here those moments when she would look at old childhood photos and say how did that child grow up to be like this when did i dismiss the morals that i subscribed to i don t know what to do and she looks at photos of her beautiful mother in her youth and is envious of that smile she had when she was twenty two and she wishes she could say the same for herself but she s lived in a self perpetuated hell because she took the literal stains and the literal scars and turned them into the emotional drain and then she fell apart and i ve never really been one for taking second chances on times that i ve been broken but sometimes forgiveness needs to be put in place for someone to actually grow from these negative emotions and all that constructive use of the pain that s thrown at you is the only way to find refuge so i m gonna tell you this darling every time you tell yourself that you re not worth it every time you tell yourself you re worthless you re being lied to and in that case the liar is you","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m gonna chisel away at this rock until i

in the door so when i close it on you i ll hurt a little bit too because the only reason i held onto you was because i felt i had nothing left and the deeper i carve into this rock i realize it s not gonna fit into the shape that i want so i quit because i ve always been afraid to fall in love because there s something about falling that just doesn t sound worth it and i ve said it before and i ll say it again it was problematic at best because you beckoned me and you lessened me and no other love would accommodate my blindfold so easily but now i can see now i can see god i gave you all of my

sometimes make me wanna hurt myself so what am i supposed to do with them your heart is on fire when you water down your words you started much higher before you found the lord and you justify the way you hate yourself with forgiveness objects of obsession in constant repetition this cycle where we try to find reasons that we re living i m a product of the products i let into my heart before i

love was never going to let go everyone wanted me to see that we could not thrive so gouge out my eyes because if this is reality then i guess i m not alive because i don t know a life in where i can t make things right and when life teaches you to drive and you finally say goodbye and you won t let me stand by your side i ll know that though some feelings are hurt none will have died cause i used to stay up at night and picture myself looking into your eyes shouting as you would sigh how dare you think you can fall asleep with water dripping from the kitchen sink how dare you think you can fall asleep with all these little leaks in this home we built in our dreams a picture is worth a thousand words or whatever people say to me it s hard to believe when your mind is lost and in need and all you can picture is a memory inside of someone else s sheets a prayer that nothing will keep a hope that light will seek before the dark sinks too deep or at least the sinking feeling inside of me will decrease when the release of perceived dreams burn in the flame of feeling free so feel free to be free if that s what you need and if someday you feel alone and everything caves in when you try to breathe know that you re not alone as far as i can see because you were everything to me through this i ve realized that if i were god we would have all just died because darling you were mine and

to leave just remember who you are and do what you can to remember me maybe someday we can talk about our past and we can talk about the weather whenever you leave i don t care what i m remembered for i just want to be remembered because even if i failed you at least i tried and maybe our lives don t add up now but someday our graves will look the same when we both die and if i had a chance i d give you one last kiss and i d bite down on your lip and i d try to puncture it so you ll never forget that time but you ll always regret and darling i know that sometimes life will take a turn for the worst and sometimes life will even hurt and i know some days some days some days you re afraid of the lessons you ll have to learn and some days you ll even feel burned and i want to let you know
