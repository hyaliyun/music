drove that car as far as we could abandoned it out west split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best she turned around to look at me as i was walking away i heard her say over my shoulder we ll meet again someday on the avenue tangled up in blue i had a job in the great north woods working as a cook for a spell but i never did like it all that much and one day the ax just fell so i drifted down to new orleans where i lucky was to be employed working for a while on a fishing boat right outside of delacroix but all the while i was alone the past was close behind i seen a lot of women but she never escaped my mind and i just grew tangled up in blue  she was working in a topless place and i stopped in for a beer i just kept looking at the side of her face in the spotlight so clear and later on when the crowd thinned out i was just about to do the same she was standing there in back of my chair said tell me don t i know your name i muttered something underneath my breath she studied the lines on my face i must admit i felt a little uneasy when she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe tangled up in blue she lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe i thought you d never say hello she said you look like the silent type then she opened up a book of poems and handed it to me written by an italian poet from the thirteenth century and every one of them words rang true and glowed like burning coal pouring off of every page like it was written in my soul from me to you tangled up in blue i lived with them on montague street in a basement down the stairs there was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air then he started into dealing with slaves and something inside of him died she had to sell everything she owned and froze up inside and when it

always saw the bright side of things and you taught me to appreciate the nice silent things remember i was just a kid trapped and forgotten but you believed in me that ll never be forgotten and you was older so your words spoke loud as i look back at it now i gotta find you in that crowd so what a mess look at me with all the stress if you ran into me now i d probably never find happiness we used to party but i never really drank i just went into the bathroom and i poured it down the sink and now i grab the bottle even tighter when i hold it i gave my soul to you but you turned around and sold it for your own life i guess i m being selfish now but i got a lot of clout from this fucking rapping style you told me that i changed i ll admit it but its strange cause i m sitting thinking you the one to blame so i hit you on your cell just to know it went to voicemail i checked your facebook but you don t really post well so how we gonna communicate i ll never know i guess i gotta let it go  don t cry just go to that place you needed time so i gave you space i ll wonder if i ll ever get to talk to you i m doing this for me yo not for you don t cry just go to that place you needed time so i gave you space i ll wonder if i ll ever get to talk to you i m doing this for me yo not for you and i just wanna know if you can hear me so maybe turn it up speak a little clearly no matter how many songs i make you gonna never hear me say that i made a mistake and that i m sorry from the bottom of my heart you put up with a lot it was a problem from the start and even if you took me back it wouldn t be the same i ll even get a tattoo for you of your name and you know i never meant to be an asshole i guess it s greener where the other people s grass grows but wait a minute why you wonder if i ll stay committed i used to visit you when you was at your baby sitting but now i need a chaperon to even get me through the day the minute that you left i had so much to say i never got the chance to even tell you that i loved you fuck you now i only see you when i m looking up above you must be selfish to take your own life what about me and the other people that i thought you liked and now that you re gone sometimes i wanna do it too i can t i gotta stay here just to spite you i ll write you when damn i m not like you we all got demons i wish that you could fight too you lost the battle and you tossed it in but you re up there in the sky and i m down without a friend don t cry just go to that place you needed time so i gave you space i ll wonder if i ll ever get to talk to you i m doing this for me yo not for you don t cry just go to that place you needed time so i gave you space i ll wonder if i ll ever get to talk to you i m doing this for me yo not for you don t cry

s out half the kids will be absent i m navigating streets sometimes it s like a labyrinth i paint my voice while sabzi builds the canvas to translate my ancestors anthems it s a southside revival put

falling down down down ever falling down never falling down down down ever falling down even if i was blindsided by mack trucks in the side street in the alley way in a foreign city i d still make it back home on a highway no bulletins no street signs no other cars no radio no satellite i d still make it back home connected to the universe like a string of lights on the holiday if one s out doesn t mean demise of all who roam the stome feel the earth char with the fire water and sky under his home under his toes under his flows under his belt it s the brian who sets the tones i never regret the way canals of birth shot me forth on my feet not my fins i am a man to finish it out don t forget gravity laws only thing keeping me from flight wings of space infinite night downward spiral not in sight down never falling down down down ever falling down great there is no father it s her and her offspring nobodys offering help skin ain t softening acts chopped to the ankles her babies coughing maybe the check will come today the wait s exhausting she s the pillar so she can t be tilted give her sons the feeling as though they got a million to blow need no stilts to reach the stars teach the kids to reach with their heads and they each will be yours i give a piece of me for her to have a piece of mind or a piece of your chicken cause it s ramen all the time she s thin and getting scared but she never lets on many men will not fall cause their mama s head strong down never falling down down down ever falling down  pick your feet on up why don t you get on up lift your spirits up damn i know this shit is tough i flunked in high school my pops he left me young i often lost my cool days i feel my mama s gun i lost my only son when my girl she almost died had abortion haunted by a babies eyes and every reason lies cause you know the truth inside you re feeling like a coward like the wrong person died but still you gotta ride let the years pass em by never really knowing why the question s why i m always high down never falling down down down ever falling down down down down ever falling down look we slipping and sliding 808 kick riding serving rocks balling while they conquering and dividing teeth glistening shining listening to ourselves lying believe in a bleeding ego still trying identifying with the why and the whats self hating is the scars and the cuts that run deep down not giving a fuck behind the sweet sound of the new blues rattling the truck from the sun roof to new shoes chrome neglecting the home disrespecting the zone that sankofa should of shown us looking back before the times that they owned us but never really owned a damn thing that spirit sounding like down never falling down down down ever falling down i m hella irresponsible i m possibly the cause of my subsequent downfall now a take a pause and reflect on my karma and laws i ve ignored all the signs that could cause a turn and redirect my preferred course of action before the curse of my actions the rehabilitation of the baddest on the planet will set a mark a mile stone of progress the life changing tones of why heart and soul mean the most learning voices be the search and exume all my skeletons a room full of demons where the angel was a prisoner she s tortured for the visitors the listeners who read between the lines and stay inquisitive to dissect these sentences down never falling down down down ever falling down last night i took a field trip kind of bent hopped a fence cut across a playground and laid down in the cemetery reflecting on my past present and current events speech slurring venting to the moon i swear she was answering me not literal but in the spiritual sense we spoke me myself and i but i wasn t alone in fact it felt that picture of a beach with footprints and the sand you know the poem hanging in grandmama s home where does love come from where does it go when it s gone what takes its place and why does that space turn hard as stone another year i am older today in many ways i ve grown but in my head them questions still they roam riding the bike she said it s like cycling in circles with your eyes closed no hands blind faith is what she called it man said life s an ocean with a lot of commotion once you dive in yeah it s deep but if you could swim it ain t mattering down never falling down down down

the worst weather it ll soon pass the skies will clear up and get better you ve seen time influencing friends so you choose to view life through a different lens you ve seen some fall victim to drugs and you don t wanna dig yourself that rut so you make your own path you try to move forward not go back it s all about making progress you know that some days your gonna fall flat on your face but you

and if i try i might be able to overcome and withstand the force trying to drag me like a snail in quick sand you know the feeling like you re running in water and every step you take keeps getting harder and harder the most beautiful thing about each day is each sunrise means you start with a clean slate one of the hardest things to do is keep faith but i believe great things are possible these

genes from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis that can help to control the disease according to a 2010 european commission report on gm organisms a decade of eu funded gmo research based on 130 research projects spanning more than 25 years and involving more than 500 independent research groups biotechnology and in particular gmos are not per se more risky than e g conventional plant breeding technologies headnote if african countries can t plant genetically modified crops to produce more and healthier food vulnerable populations will be at risk argues calestous juma to survive the droughts wars and other major causes of famine africa must embrace technologies that enable it to produce more better food with less effort indeed without the advances in molecular biology and other scientific fields that occurred in the second half of the twentieth century african nations would be much worse off than they are now without this green revolution which enabled developing nations to import cheaper grains and grow high yield seed varieties analysts estimate that crop yields in developing countries would have been 23 5 lower and prices between 35 and 66 higher in 2000 caloric intake would have dropped by up to 14 4 and the proportion of malnourished children would have increased by nearly 8 put another way the green revolution helped to raise the nutritional status of up to 42 million preschool children in developing countries these tools were a great help to african nations in the previous century but they are not sufficient to help africa s agriculture survive what is coming rising population and loss of productivity brought on by ecological disruptions such as environmental degradation and frequent droughts to weather these changes african nations must be open to new biotechnology tools that allow farmers to grow crops that have even higher yields and a higher nutritional content and which can withstand biological and physical stresses at present only a few african countries are allowed to grow genetically modified crops partly because of restrictive national biosafety policies that impose excessive regulatory barriers to the adoption of agricultural biotechnology this must change for starters african farmers need pest resistant gm cotton which is already being cultivated in south africa and burkina faso these crops do not raise food safety concerns but their higher yields bring more disposable income to farmers who can use that money for food crops more countries should be planting herbicide tolerant maize now in use in south africa and egypt which reduces the need for weeding a significant benefit for african farmers mostly women who spend nearly 2 000 hours a year weeding a hectare of land future innovations could bring even more benefits to african countries for example the bill melinda gates foundation of seattle washington is funding projects to produce crops that carry drought tolerant genes africa needs gm varieties of the black eyed pea a subspecies of the cowpea the crop is often attacked by the insect maruca vitrata which causes us 300 million in losses annually to small scale farmers in africa their only means of controlling the disease is using expensive pesticides which cost nigeria an estimated 500 million a year their losses affect the world the african continent currently produces nearly 5 2 million tonnes of the bean accounting for nearly 70 of global output scientists at the institute for agricultural research at ahmadu bello university in zaria nigeria have developed a gm variety containing insecticide genes from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis that can help to control the disease disease resistance africa would also benefit greatly from having other disease resistant crops bananas for example are a staple in uganda where adults often eat three times their body weight in bananas annually but the banana is threatened by a bacterial disease known as xanthomonas wilt which causes more than 500 million in crop losses annually the disease also affects other african countries in the great lakes region there are no resistant varieties of banana and no ways of treating them chemically ugandan scientists are working on creating a gm banana using genes from sweet pepper that helps to control xanthomonas but even if ugandan scientists can produce such a banana the country s farmers are banned from growing it only 29 countries worldwide grow gm crops and only three of those are african but this is set to change in coming years according to the non profit organization international service for the acquisition of agri biotech applications kenya has already adopted a law that permits the import of gm foods this has opened the door for approving the cultivation of gm crops critics of biotechnology are right to question its role in world agriculture like other agricultural practices biotechnology is not risk free concerns such as the transfer of gm genes to wild relatives and the development of resistance to pests need be taken seriously and kept under constant review but addressing them requires greater investment in science and technology not less such monitoring should be part of wider strategies to conserve biological diversity and protect human health they should not be designed to discriminate against gm crops furthermore gm critics are wrong to conclude that because biotechnology does not solve all problems it has no place in helping humanity to address long term food needs they often base their arguments on the presumption that most of the unintended consequences of genetic modification are likely to be negative such as cases in which herbicide resistant crops have spread to neighbouring lands but we must look at the relative risks of all technologies including the risks of not adopting the technology such as how african nations would have suffered without the green revolution according to a 2010 european commission report on gm organisms a decade of eu funded gmo research based on 130 research projects spanning more than 25 years and involving more than 500 independent research groups biotechnology and in particular gmos are not per se more risky than e g conventional plant breeding technologies the application of biotechnology has a number of unintended ecological benefits for example the adoption of gm crops has curbed the release of greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the use of pesticides which require energy to manufacture it has also saved farmers from heavy exposure to these chemicals in addition the use of herbicide tolerant crops enables farmers to cut back on the ploughing and weeding that releases carbon that would otherwise be sequestered in the soil for 2009 it is estimated that biotech crops resulted in 17 6 billion kilograms of carbon dioxide sequestration and forgone release the equivalent of removing 7 8 million cars from the road solving world hunger will involve more than just producing more food but excluding technological options that raise productivity will do more harm than good the international community would be better served by taking a pragmatic approach that accommodates the best available technological options rather than relying on ideological political positions that will put the world s most vulnerable people at risk all technological options for meeting global food needs should therefore be on the table including agricultural biotechnology sidebar planting crops that are drought resistant could enable farmers to use less water and fertilizer authoraffiliation calestous juma is the director of the agricultural innovation in africa project at harvard kennedy school cambridge massachusetts 02138 usa he is author

the bloody unknown i heard that your mother took off in the fall with her pretty curls and her wooden spoon i heard you whispering to yourself last night she ll be coming home some day soon well the wine you drink is stained deep in your shirt and just like the sin in my soul it is never ever ever ever coming out while the stars bear down from their throne and the old southern cross is shown and it points down the sad road home to the land of the hunter dancing under the trigger and the bride washing up on the shore i could never really dance that well i can t raise the flags or ring them bells but i can shoot my gun down the line towards my home to the land of the bloody unknown there s a black dog watching over me in my sleep and i stir just to toss him the bone there s a red moon

along with bell biv devoe i had jay o s and a pair of zebra pants but this was the foundation what would come to be a life long passion journey and drive an mc some people ask me what it means i dont know where to start its the deepest connection between my soul and my heart when i first stepped to do a cypher in a jam at the park i got served no for real i got served but see i learned something observed others and watched an urge hungered verse studier earned a turn on that block i dont care who you are or where you re from or what you believe in but if you love hip hop i bet its more or less for the same reason this is it when you spit you exist in that moment and if you re sick with that gift you then rip it when you perform it then all the shit that you live begins to lift off your shoulders and the audience well they get to experience where your soul is the most amazing feeling rocking a crowd to your anthem to the front to the back with their motherfucking hands up cause i m

clothes the hoes or the cars that make people rap like they re trapped inside these bars this shit ain t complicated man just be who you are too busy searching for the light missing the fact that you re a star now who s got passion stand the hell up cause i wanna hear somebody rapping who s got it inside their cuts now you can get intricate displaying your fancy cadences but if you re not speaking the truth you might as well not be saying shit i said who s going to teach the kids you wanna blow up and get famous so you can get some new rims all the money in the world can help you look like a star but money can t buy you the heart to go and put inside your bars and i like nice shit too believe me i got a closet full of nikes and whole bunch of velour suits fitted white tees and an icy earrings like the whole youth population of hip hop but look beyond it when i record to these beats but if i don t speak me what s the difference between my and what you hearin on mtv people fear that if they re steering away from the mainstream then their album won t sell well i could give a fuck i m just gonna freestyle and spit what s inside my gut and if you want to you can go and label me

for like 3 weeks and see what happens see if this idea of releasing music from another country every month can work i ve never been to berlin before i didn t know anyone and even though i took 4 years of german lessons the only thing i remembered was die katz快 ist in der kirche which means th快 cat is inside the church so relatively useful but my manager clementin who s actually younger than me and has a name suspiciously close to my little sister cl谷mentine he works in berlin so he knew some other artists i could work with so together we made a list of german artists that we really liked and tried contacting them sounds fun but we got a lot of no and even more left on read messages but eventually we got some really cool yes too and among those yes were david bay ana?s moli saint wknd and fil bo riva with whom i did this song with grapejuice coming to berlin i knew i d have to get out of my comfort zone i mean my bedroom and try to write with actually real people to be quite honest with you i struggled a bit i ve been so used to do this alone that having someone looking at me while i m like ehhh ahh trying to find a cool melody is weird and it also felt a bit like going to work too i had to dress up first be on time because people were waiting for me and hand over my paper at the end of the day 3 things i was no longer used to since i left school but the truth is it was never like work music sessions were actually closer to going on a date than going to work for example we talked for hours about life trips relationships whatever before even listening to some music we sometimes had drinks and diner super late at night well we never kissed but could have even though it would have been super weird but yeah only eventually someone picked an instrument and started playing something and then we would move on and try to write a song but the whole thing was just to have fun in a room full of instruments i guess if i learned one thing out of these sessions it d be don t think about the outcome but rather focus on the moment you re living just to keep the best memory of it cause if you enjoy whatever you re doing then it s enough even though we didn t make real actual finished songs every time i learned so much from these people and made some really great friends too and that is enough i think and that s exactly how it happened when we wrote grapejuice fil his producer robert and i decided to go straight to an italian restaurant just down robert s studio so the first time we all met was actually while eating a slice of pizza a few hours later we went back to the studio fil sat in front of the piano robert picked a bass and i picked a guitar then we just had fun playing and it turned into a song i could never have written that song without fil and robert without playing together and listening to each other s ideas so i guess i was right comin in to work that day  i m still not that comfortable being in a session but i really want to get better at it and i will i ll talk to you when i arrive in london take care xx oscar","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"now turn it up turn it up turn it up can t live my i i can t live my i can t live my i i can
