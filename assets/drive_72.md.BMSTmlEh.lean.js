face and the guitar player laid down the heavy layer of the funky junky rhythm of the disco beat and the guy with the 88 s started to participate and i could sure appreciate a sound so sweet we were all in the mood so we had a little food and a joke and a smoke and a little bit of wine when i thought i heard a hoof on the top of the roof could it be or was it me i was feeling super fine so i went to the attic where i thought heard the static on the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in but the noise on the top was a reindeer clop just a trick st nick and i let the sucker in he was rolly he was poly and i said holy moly you got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin he allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd on the point of his jaw where the skin should ve been gets

re right it s cold tonight but can you stop for a drop before you go he said why not if the music s hot and i ll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe so he went downstairs and forgot his cares and he rocked the spot and danced like a pro and every young girl tried to rock his world but he boogie oogie oogied til he had to go and before he went this fine old gent brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags in the top or the bottom he reached in and got em toys for the boys for the girls glad rags and the grownups got some presents too a new tv and a stereo a new seville bout as blue as the sky the best that money couldn t buy cause money could never ever buy the feeling the one that comes from not concealing the way you you feel about your friends and this is how the story ends the

there and see what these labels were talking about and i m driving us there but my license s suspended so i tell slim i m like yo i gotta pull up before we get to new york and switch so you can drive in case we get pulled over cause we got pulled over the last time we went there but you know he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later i m pulling over in this emergency lane and right as i m opening the door to switch with slim boom this fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us yo i swear to god i woke up half my body s laying outside the car in the ditch like 15 20 feet away from where we just were the car was totalled the windows were smashed it was cold as fuck it was raining outside but we were actually okay i mean my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit he ended up being alright but our meeting s with the record label started at 2 and we didn t have no car and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in new jersey so this dude that i ended up partnering with later on his name s james mcmillan he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit somehow someway i don t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could ve died a couple of hours ago but i m in there and like you know i m not feeling this shit man i m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to cleveland now i m back in ashleigh s mom s basement i m thinking about life you know i m on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and ashleigh runs downstairs and she s like yo yo kells kells you re not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now i m like who she s like he s gonna call you in 30 seconds now i guess when i was in new york i had made some kinda noise cause this dude named byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video i had called chip off the block over to bad boy and showed harve pierre and harve pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named puff so i answer my phone depressed down fucked up on vicodin and i hear please hold i have

know we all in the same boat yeah christians and muslims everybody like that huh yow you lookin for truth oh i ve got some answers man so good to be ah let s get into it let s go night and day i ain t scared to say that we different they play the prostitute but they like to say they just intimate idols in their heart they can t seem to lose their grip on it see them walkin in the direction that king agrippa went our world is different like whitley and wayne man they say we look the same but we ain t chasin the same thing it all boils down to they think everything s relative jesus might as well be a south american president very evident they say that jesus was heaven sent they lifestyle reflects they worship themselves instead of him they don t acknowledge the christ if they did they wouldn t worship themselves by the way that they live all these rappers say they got guns that spray off 16 i ve got a luke 9 that can take all 16 that s the bible the one they quote but they don t care about the author they think he s a joke man some folks say all truth is relative it just depends on what you believe you know hey man ain t no way to know for sure who god is or what s really true but that means you believe your own statement that there s no way to know what s really true you re saying that that statement is true you re killing yourself if what s true for you is true for you and what s true for me is true for me what if my truth says yours is a lie is it still true come on man  i promise everybody is asking the same questions who am i what is my purpose and my direction you probably believe that you exist for no other reason than self satisfaction hedonism and pleasing things life s about you gettin yours and bein happy even if it means a divorce and switchin families your job your house your car your spouse it s all for the glory of you else you out you go to school get your degrees and get a job so you can make a whole lot of gs cause life s hard you never thought of livin to please a real god and that s the reason he made you see he gave you breath to breathe the chest to breathe it so you can taste and see he s the best believe it he made us for his glory and not for your own homie our god is holy you should repent and die slowly see there s this thing called secular humanism that says man is the source of all meaning and all purpose you know what i m saying we re just the result of a big cosmic explosion we don t really have a purpose or meaning so we just come up with our own purpose we re the source of our meaning and our purpose but how can a man which is the product of chance a finite being be the source of purpose and meaning you can t we re created with purpose man get with the creator y all man everybody got a problem with god and when you mention the christ then they really get to turning the knobs but some say they roll with christ cause some rappers made it seem like he was cool with all the sin in their life no but then some say how can god exist when all this evil stuff in the world keep persistin wrong question ask again how come god ain t let you feel the wrath from sin what you thought last night deserved a first class flight to hell where god doesn t dwell you got that right but he bought back life on a cross that night christ died you ain t know that it cost that price all of god s anger poured on his son then together through all of eternity now he was shunned praise god for the life that was won for us ain t got a beef with god because the son was crushed hey look man some people say that god ain t real cause they don t see how a good god can exist with all this evil in the world if god is real then he should stop all this evil cause he s all powerful right what is evil though man it s anything that s against god it s anything morally bad or wrong it s murder rape stealing lying cheating but if we want god to stop evil do we want him to stop it all or just a little bit of it if he stops us from doing evil things what about lying or what about our evil thoughts i mean where do you stop the murder level the lying level or the thinking level if we want him to stop evil we gotta be consistent we can t just pick and choose that means you and i would be eliminated right because we think evil stuff if that s true we should be eliminated but thanks be to god that jesus stepped in to save us from our sin christ died for all evilness repent turn to jesus man 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"aye look what s good man it s me again the one you used to call your friend i

walls manifold wisdom of god no longer a mystery the church is the pinnacle of our salvific history one flesh union homie the tri union is glorified through our corporatized communion still the

just to show her she the church she ain t bricks and buildings she all of god s people men women and children her name is ecclesia meaning the the assembly bows to no other divinity a body family and community she is all one but on earth you see her in congregational small ones a microcosm or a small scale example but yes it is the church even though it s just a sample invisible spiritual physical visible not a brick temple never that simple this a not a building she is not bricks she s a world changer but ain t bout getting rich perpetrating fakes cause a lot of folks to hate plus her hands

some don t get it so they hate they say she s on a paper chase they say she s really fake so they go start a ministry so they can do the work but they don t understand how jesus feel about his church and yeah they make disciples they got plenty conversions they take care of the widows and the orphans they be workin but none of them are churchin no church structure no elders and no discipline they don t have a conductor and they so they don t submit but quite a few of them baptize people how i pray that you d look at this thing from god s eyes take responsibility inside the whole council not just the area where you might have a mouthful who should folks submit to who will conduct the discipline if excommunicated what body will they be missing then look at ephesians 4 where paul gets practical 1st timothy and titus if you thinking i m irrational homie that s the church yeah she may look gritty when her man come back she gone look so pretty she the church you might see her acting

depend on friends how many of us have them friends before we go any further let s be friends is a word we use everyday most the time we use it in the wrong way now you can look the word up again and again but the dictionary doesn t know the meaning of friends and if you ask me you know i couldn t be much help because a friend s somebody you judge for yourself some are ok and they treat you real cool but some mistake your kindness for bein a fool we like to be with some because they re funny others come around when they need some money some you grew up with around the way and you re still real close to this very day homeboys through the summer winter spring and fall and then there s some we wish we never knew at all and this list goes on again and again but these are the people that we call friends when we first went out together we barely knew each other we had no intentions on becoming lovers but in no time at all you became my girl me and you one on one against the world talkin on the telephone for hours at a time or else i was at your house or you was at mine and then came the arguments and all kinds of problems besides making love we had nothing in common it could ve lasted longer because it started out strong but i guess we went about the whole thing wrong cause out of nowhere it just came to an end because we became lovers before we were friends friends how many of us have them friends ones we can depend on friends how many of us have them friends before we go any further let s be friends you say you and your girl friend were so tight you took her out with you and your guy one night she even had a set of keys to your home and you shared mostly everything you owned but as she shook your hand she stole your man and it was done so sweet it had to be a plan couldn t trust her with cheese let alone your keys with friends like that you don t need enemies you wonder how long it was all going on and you re still not sure if you re glad he s gone you say well if she took him he was never mine but deep inside you know that s just another lie and now you re kinda cold toward people you meet cause of something that was done to you by some creep but nevertheless i ll say it again that these are the people that we call friends  friends how many of us have them friends ones we can depend on friends how many of us have them friends before we go any further let s be friends9","artist_name":"Whodini"},{"lyrics":"you self destructive little girl pick yourself up don t blame the world so you screwed up but you re gonna be okay now call your

just something about our love i m still in denial now dealing with the finality of and it s making me crazy thinking of the days we spent and how i ll never hold you again and there ain t shit i can do about it now my head is overcrowded with these clouded memories and i can t seem to get you out it and how the fuck do you sleep comfortably knowing what you done did to me huh did it even occur to you that i loved you completely deep and madly head over heels for you was you and me once used to be together forever it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream we was supposed to die together and it s killing me so much when i sleep i wake up dead must be why i saw two white coffins in my dreams last night i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light saw my old

took you straight to the spot i moved away for some years to atlanta georgia but stayed the same my troublesome attitude got me locked in an ugly chain we kept in touch every week and i noticed the change you wanted to clean up and go to school some day do the family thing and i was too wild to get it admittedly so but i supported your move no matter which way that you rolled i guess you made a good choice graduated with honors got a good job at the factory making that legal dollar and as for me i got worse i found myself in a curse dropped out of school for a dream a dream i didn t rehearse you hit me up cuz you knew when you saw me i was bad off but i was too proud to ask for the help cuz i knew the cost but you offered a place to stay until i could find my way you helped me go find a gig clean up and get it straight never once did you tell me to stop rapping and give it up as we sat talking on the bed of your lifted truck you had it all and i had nothing i m just saying that meant something brother if you ever need me around i ll be on the next train headed southbound i ll never let you down i can t let you down because when i couldn t get my feet on the ground you d do

you may see me in publications and radio placements a new truck a new harley and think i forgot how i made it but ain t a day that goes by that i don t recall the struggle scared to death to go back to it i constantly hustle i thank you for my ambition for the strength to condition anyone who helped me along the way and believed in my vision it takes a village to raise a child for me it took small towns everything that i learned from it the ups and the downs my uncle buddy he gave me a thousand dollars to make a tape back in 02 when i could barely afford a plate and he couldn t afford it either but he did it anyhow and now he wears a thousand dollar smile uncle bud  if you ever need me around i ll be on the next train headed southbound i ll never let you down i can t let you down
