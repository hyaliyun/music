you feel protected but those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing some people say nobody s perfect but expect perfection how you supposed to find the answer if you don t ask the question sometimes i look into the mirror and talk to my reflection when i go home and turn the music off what am i left with breathe breathe we used to be close but as time passed we became disconnected you never felt love and i always felt disrespected your family thought i was a joke i was always defensive they just wanted what was best for you i just couldn t accept it and hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions but i was immature i guess i had to learn some lessons we grew apart and our lives went in different directions and there s a lot of responsibilities that i neglected i had a lot that was bottled inside couldn t express it and this pain won t leave i can feel the depression it s taking over my body feels like i m always stressing doctor told me i should sleep but i m always restless i lay awake at night and think my thoughts are relentless i need a moment to breathe i need a moment to vent this i seem to be the only person that i play pretend with

what your life was the destiny of stars is their light must fight dusk with sparks of brilliance to ignite us and of all the billions of stars you were by far the brightest i heard you had a voice like an angel now it s just a light hush but now you keep everybody s eyes on charts and schedules and the trends trying to stack gold bars and medals they want vessels void and dark as space fools wanna make stars instead of music that s smart or special because art at a level that s real can be harder to peddle business prefers a market that settles for second rate kill the true artists martyr

get hired up to walk over have knots on a tight rope tied up in my gut it s a delicate balance developing talent into persons that we worship yo it s a hell of a challenge i heard you had a voice like an angel and don t really sing no more but you still running the game so if we don t behave like them they call us crazy and if we won t slave for them they call us lazy lately i ve started to see why you hate me hearing this voice it must be painful to the ears when for years you had a voice like an angel  if you don t behave like them they call you crazy and if you won t slave for them they call you lazy well i say they wanna take your mind turn it into a prison and lock you inside then they call that living well i say i heard you had a voice like an angel they say smile for the camera they

blue river stardust fell through space released and gave its peace to a man in his place beneath graciously as he laid asleep draped in sheets with his honest wife in the gold days of his old age and on this nice august night his soul raised he saw this light the calmest bright like coldplay it was all yellow and in its gold rays he saw his plight as it showed him the youth that he d forgot about like how he block the spout on his house s hose and not let the water out he thought it out and wondered how he d remembered it all how younger he d enter the halls when summer surrendered the fall then he wondered was his life through in slumber under this bright moon like skies after thunder the light grew and more from the limitless stash of images flashed and poured from the reservoir to mimic his past he saw himself with his wife growing old his children s lives he filled with pride as the light showed his soul then it s brilliance died  and it was dead black in his eyes a voice said that it was time but he was steadfast in his mind so he said back in reply please seeing my life like this it made me think i could state succinctly everything life is if you gave me ink and i could maybe print every speech and thought and release my plot on these streets i ve walked with a piece of chalk to paint the sharpest image of a heart cuz as much as art can mimic nothing s as real as a life told from start to finish suddenly the man awoke with a violent cry that strangely didn t seem to disturb the silent sky his wife was still beside him under the blankets enclosed and when he looked up at the clock he saw the hands in it froze so the man just arose put his hands to the roads and began to compose the most candid of prose so he wrote every quote spoken and left every breath kept sketched in the next step of concrete then death crept and lead him to his bed as the sun began to rise he titled his surprise the story of the man that died then his wife and the townsfolk awoke and were shocked first by his passing but then by what he wrote with his chalk they got the roads blocked by a flock of postmen and cops he wrote from his lot to the edge of town close to the docks where he used to watch the boats and often joked with his pops his folks had not long ago passed and now both with him walk people came from everywhere they read the story through for days it wasn t nothing new or strange still they were moved and amazed it wasn t the places he d been or the people he d met it was the spaces between and the secrets he d kept they wept joyfully for the greatest

it rains in the park you re hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic to pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates now you re working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus and you re willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence if nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense then do you really regret when you ve shredded your promises now i ve tested the waters kid sipped it rippled the pond a bit visits have been abolished and this shit s killing my confidence is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment if you miss chicks when they re around the phrase let s quit isn t an option you best fix whatever s wrong and just move on and get on with it cause you ll catch bigger

shit i just found the watch but hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock and i can t die without trying my hands tied in knots knowing that i ll never learn to brave the waves if i stand by the docks love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of death it s as massive a shock and to intellects it s a fuckin smack in the crotch it s a cancer

of parents never transfering that unbillical joy so girls create a false world of filling on boys exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys but when you have it there s nothing

you leavin them slits in your back but i ve been a lucky one loving parents loving friends but i still spend alot of my life loving sin but i ain t a genious on it i can only pretend cause over all it s an emotion i can not comprehend it s love love ain t the basis for action in a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction and the past isn t felt as a match made in hell but rather its held as a latter day meld of common mistakes and nice intentions but when false love retention is simply vice invention its only right to mention the fights you get in nightly visions of these tina and ike revisions so whats love really got to do with it from prude women to stool

eating heathens even eat their cats and dogs and that s because they re misers fuckin cabbies in a hurry covered in the stench of curry and they re awful drivers the law provides us with no means of protection not even a weapon to stop the evil conception and my people are threatened by the rate at which they multiply alarming enough to make the true patriots pulses high cultist like worship hindu and buddhist rituals our lord christ would turn in his grave due to his principles the way they re taking bread from the truly blessed sons i d have to say the only good brown and yellow folks are dead ones i d like to add lastly aids ain t a disease we should take tainted ivs and jam up the pillow bitin fags ass cheeks and dykes are twice as bad what kinda woman doesn t like to shag no

in jump in by those scopes no in the water in the river yes jump in the river jump in the river we re all born into this river without knowing how to swim and eventually we learn how to keep the water under our chins some times this river is so cold to be in freezing my soul solidifying my skin regardless of how far i see i never see my travels end we re carried by the current being driven by the wind the scenery we pass we ll never see again so we store it up as memories and don t let go of them were under a spell thinking the river should go straight we set goals and desires to control our own fate but all the pain we experience is a result of our expectations because it s the rivers nature to twist and turn the shit can burn and i know it i have the same conflict but i try to sit and flow with this rivers natural process and sometimes when i watch myself float downstream i see the beauty of it all and it feels like a dream and at that time i appreciate the rivers course some call it god reality momentum force i stare up at the naked moon and she stares down at me outside false boundaries i m all i look outward to see the universe is not something separate from yourself i know you feel alone but that s why i m here to help i know you feel alone but just look up at the stars and everything that is out there is what you really are we gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life everyone has different pasts and we re seeking the light the world is divided between peasants and kings but the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing now i want you to know

for you in the same way that you re here for me each person in an intricate piece of infinity i feel that if you could see what i see then we as humanity could be free i m here for you not for any self centered reasons because existence is interdependent and all s related connected in its different manifestations of one single mind you ain t isolated from the world even though it feels like that sometimes i see the hurt when i look into your eyes how you struggle to hold it and keep in bundled inside it drives a dull blade deep in my heart it makes me want to cry so i offer you a hand to help wash away the rainy skies i m running out of words but i haven t yet made my message clear so if none of this makes sense i just want you to know i m here as a musician as a friend as a teacher as a student to grow and realize that everything s in constant movement each problem that we face is just a part of this movement it seems helpless but if we stick together we ll get through it and return to the essence from which we ve been uprooted and wake humanity from these illusions the second you can look into the sky and see your own reflection you know your head is in the right direction the river riding always moves but with it i live and everything is perfect just the way it is we gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life everyone has different pasts and we re

getting high just to balance out the lows and i could use a writer just to balance out my flows but i never share my thoughts this is all a nigga knows and every time i try it opens up my eyes these

honest i m so tired of being subtle it s just me 40 o and nik standing in a huddle staring at the members of my team who get questioned bout they profit from this million dollar scheme just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams i hope you tell your families this shit ain t what it seems but y all the reason for a lot of my devotion you know i spend money because spending time is

biggest in the game and realize when you re there sometimes the shit don t feel the same yeah and plus things are just surreal at home people think i ve changed just cause my appeal has grown and now security follow me everywhere so i never actually am alone i just always feel alone i think i m scared of what the future holds i was wishing for some things and now am used to those every girl i meet thinks i m fucking groupie hoes the honesty of my music has left me too exposed all my old friends think i got a new crowd and people seem to notice every time i do smile i guess that mean they come few and far between even though i m living out what you would call the dream and my uncle ain t even messaging me and him missing in my life is kind of messing with me i hope this isn t one of those

town they came in camouflage hidden behind dark glasses but no one noticed them they only saw shadows you see without the truth of the eyes the happyfolk were blind falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes waiting for the sunset to come people going home jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head now everybody dancing the dance of the dead the dance of the dead the dance of the dead in time the strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain and it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty by chance they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest the strangefolk they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things and soon they began to mine the mountain its rich seam fueling the chaos of their own world meanwhile down in the town the happyfolk slept restlessly their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls every day people would wake and stare at the mountain why was it bringing darkness into their lives and as the strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain holes began to appear bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the monkey for the first time the happyfolk felt fearful for they knew that soon the monkey would stir from its deep sleep and then came a sound distant at first it grew into castrophany so immense that it could be heard far away in space there were no screams there was no time the mountain called monkey had spoken there was only fire and then nothing  oh little town in the usa your time has come to

at the back of the church feeling water on your brow if it s healing it hurts at first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought that the needle in your skin will bring you closer to god and i watch as your head turns full circle all hopeless with old coffee and a medical text it s too easy knowing nothing blowing off the rest and the riddles in the pages leave it too much to guess and the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest as i watch as your head turns full circle you got lost in your travels and a spiritual book mistook beaches for nirvana in the way that they look and the crooks that run the island are killing to keep earning they re burning seven tonnes of plastic and it seems to be working is that the best that i can do so watch as your head turns full circle you appear even tempered though your looks will deceive and the sparks are always flying cause you drink for relief with the heart of a child and the wit of a fool it s a wonder why i don t try to build a wall around you and i watch as your head turns full circle yeah i watch as your head turns full circle yeah i watch as your head turns full circle16","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"your eyes as we said
