mad when the class was dismissed but when it was in session i always had a question i would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and help me with my problem it was never much just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch oh how i wish i could hold her hand and give her a hug she was married to the man he was a thug his name was lee he drove a z he d pick her up from school promptly at 3 o clock i was on her jock yes indeedy i wrote graffiti on the bus first i d write her name then carve a plus with my name last on the looking glass i seen her yesterday but still i had

can t stand when brothers tell me that i should quit chasin and look for something better but the smile that she shows makes me a go getter i haven t gone as far as asking if i could get with her i just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture i m shooting for her heart got my finger on the trigger she could be my broad and i could be her nigga but all i can do was stare back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare now she s more sophisticated highly edu ma cated not at all overrated i think i need a prayer to get in her book and it looks rather dry i guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye although she s crazy stepping i ll try and stop her stride cause i won t have no more of this passing me by time for me to voice my opinion can t be pretending she didn t have me sprung like a chicken chasing my tail like a doggie she was kind of like a star thinking i was like a fan damn she looked good downside she had a man he was a rooty toot a nincompoop she told me soon your little birdie s gonna fly the coop she was a flake like corn and i was born not to understand by letting her pass i had proved to be a better man she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing me by she keeps on passing me now there she goes again the dopest ethiopian and now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when ever she happens to walk by why does the apple of my eye overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much i try wait no i did not really pursue my little princess with persistence and i was so low key that she was unaware of my existence from a distance i desired her secretly admired her wired her a letter to get her and it went my dear my dear my dear you do not know me but i know you very well now let me tell you about the feelings i have for you when i try or make some sort of attempt i simp damn i wish i wasn t such a wimp cause then i would let you know that i love you so and if i was your man then i would be true the only lying i would do is in the bed with you then i signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly ps love me tender the letter came back three days later return to sender damn she

on the gay rights issues particularly gay marriage is let s be honest if you re against gay marriage you just don t like gay people and you wanna stick it to em and i m not saying i wouldn t do the same thing if i was presented with similar opportunities like if there was a law up for debate like hey man do you think guys that wear tight t shirts and get bottle service at night clubs should be allowed to own property and i would be like nooo fuck those guys yeah um it violates the sanctity of owning property and it says in the bible that they re douche bags whatever i need to say so that

thing you say on stage always feels stupid because there s no real reason for me to talk to you it just doesn t exist i don t know you you don t you don t even know each other you re facing the same direction that s all you have in common so i just have to bleh it s like talkin to a girl at a bar because you re attracted to her the first thing you say is just gonna be dog shit comin out of your mouth because you don t know her the only honest thing that you can say to her is i wanna fuck your face that s the only thing you can say that you can mean anything else you can say is you trying really hard not to say i wanna fuck your face that s the only thing i wanna put my penis in the lowest hole in your head i was never good at that like i was very bad at being single which is a problem because i m divorced so i m single again after ten years of marriage and no here cut the shit don t even start with that noise like a puppy died let me tell you somethin let me tell you somethin and this is important because some day one of your friends is gonna get divorced it s gonna happen and they re gonna tell you don t go oh i m sorry that s a stupid thing to say it really is first of all you re makin em feel bad for being really happy which isn t fair and sec let me explain somethin to you divorce is always good news i know that sounds weird but it s true because no good marriage has ever ended in divorce it s really that simple that s never happened it that would be sad if two people were married and they were really happy and they just had a great thing and then they got divorced that would be really sad but that has happened zero times literally zero ray charles has killed more jews than happy marriages have ended in divorce so if your friend got divorced it means things were bad and now they re i mean i mean they re they re better they re not good life is shit wall to wall but they re better so you should be happy but the part that s difficult is being single at forty one after ten years of marriage and two kids it s that s like having a bunch of money in the currency of a country that doesn t exist anymore like like i found 500 000 000 prussian franks i can t really take advantage of being single because i didn t i didn t expect to be single i m not prepared i didn t think i d ever be i didn t keep this shit up you understand i didn t maintain any of this at presentation condition it s function only it was not i didn t think i would need it that way i thought i was gonna be shovin it into the same person every three months til one of us died that s what i thought was the nature of the deployment for this i didn t think it d have to be like appealing to someone from scratch it s like havin a it s like havin a 73 dodge dart in your backyard and it s been sittin back there with grass growin you don t have any it s not an old mustang you have no plans to restore that dart you don t even see it when you look out the window and now you find out

i can t take that to work i have no single instincts i know to much to be single i know everything that happens now that s no good for single you gotta be optimistic to be single stupid you have to be stupid that s what optimistic means you know it means stupid an optimist somebody goes hey maybe something nice will happen why the fuck would anything nice ever happen what are you stupid but that s the attitude you have to be to be single you have to look at somebody and go ooh maybe i don t look at it that way even when i see somebody i m attracted to at was at a gym the other day why why i m

went to a place recently that i think is one of the most fucked up places i ve ever been to i m convinced this place is the epitome of american excess and greed i m talking about a place called cold

there whatever the crap people want in there snickers bar cheeseburger let me fuck a butterfinger into it for you its like woah woah woah jesus this is way too intense for me is that guy s dick a

where they take current popular music and shove cold stone lingo into it like they re some retarded half cousin to weird al that s obsessed with ice cream it s ridiculous five people are singing and

however we want it and creatively they were so awesome and so cool some of the shows on the network are not really my cup of tea only because i don t like huge pieces of shit in my tea i was watching this dating show on there called next man if anyone here been a contestant on next do me a favor and go away and die cause you re a horrible person and i don t want comedy bringing any kind of satisfaction into your miserable existence first guy that comes out right hes the guy going out on the dates and he comes up there and he says yo she better be pretty cause if she s a pain in the ass i m gonna need something pretty to look at and i was stunned that he could say that that s so offensive and at the same time on my show they didn t want us to say that a character was raped by a dinosaur raped by a dinosaur because that s too offensive i guess they didn t want all these angry letters from paleontologists saying hey man there s nothing on fossil records that suggests that kind of behavior so why don t you chill with your accusations and then after you meet this dude you meet the girls he s going out on the dates with and they come up there and they say things like if he has a neck tattoo i m gonna lick it it s like woah how slutty can you be in 5 seconds and after they say that they freeze and like three facts about them pop up on the left side the first two facts are always really normal but the third fact always comes way out of left field its always like monica s 22 she s a hairdresser in hollywood and she hates purple giftwrap how does that define her as a person and the whole show bummed me out man cause the things they try to keep off tv are just like really explicit sex or violence and no one cares about their kids seeing attitudes like that on tv and that s way worse to me like i would much rather have a daughter that grew up and shot me in the leg and burned my house down than some really slutty girl who hates the sound of people eating bananas my favorite third fact i ever saw on next though was this one guy named clarence his third fact was that he hates the phrase riverview you didn t mishear me when the words river and view start coming together clarence is like hold up don t do that and i was like what would make a man hate the phrase riverview i could only think of one scenario and it s terrible but i have to share it with you so one day this guy clarence was coming home right he was walking down this dark alley and gets jumped by this motorcycle gang and they just start raping him and all he can see is this sign that says riverview and these guys are just like say it clyde say it and he s just like riverview riverview riverview riverview so yeah if you were raped by the riverview rape gang then hate the word riverview otherwise just stop looking at property in that area i think you notice something really weird about me when i m doing that bit and that is i m a really laid back rapist i just bend my knees

hey aziz me and you are the only two white people at this concert and i was like first of all jason i m not white second of all you re the only white guy at this concert we might kill you jason so the

and then when he does the boom a spotlight comes out of his cock and goes over the whole audience like he s cumming on the whole crowd then the spotlight hits the screen and the screen explodes and i was like woah you aren t going to see shit like that at a modest mouse concert wow and then there s like all this other weird stuff like at one point he leaves the stage and they cut to a video of him playing basketball with his friends its about four minutes long and then he comes back on stage and goes to the next song and doesn t address why he showed that video you can t do shit like that i can t leave the stage show you some video of me playing foosball with my friends and come back and be like man iphones are crazy you d be like man what s up with that video you showed you ve gotta explain

kind of knew you liked the dude from private school he s waiting for the time to move i knew he had his eyes on you he s not the right guy for you don t hate me cause i write the truth no i would never lie to you but it was never fine to lose you and what a way to find out it never came from my mouth you never changed your mind but you were just afraid to mind out but it i won t be changing the subject i love it i ll make your little secret public it s nothing i m just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me trapped and i m lacking sleep fact is you re mad at me because i backtrack so casually you re practically my family if we married then i ll guess you d have to be but tragically our love just lost the will to live but would i kill to give it one more shot i think not i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t want you no anymore i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t wanna love you no anymore recently i tend to zone out up in my headphones to holocene you promised your body but i m away so much i stay more celibate than in a monastery i m not cut out for life on the road cause i didn t know i d miss you this much and at the time we d just go so sue me i guess i m not the man that you need ever since you went to uni i ve been sofa surfing with a rucksack full of less cash and i guess that could get bad but when i broke the industry that s when i broke your heart i was supposed to chart and celebrate but good things are over fast i know it s hard to deal with and see this i tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features then i turn the music off and all i m left with is to pick up my personal pieces jesus i never really want to believe this got advice from my dad and he told me that family is all i ll ever have and need i guess i m unaware of it success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with  i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t want you no anymore i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t wanna love you no anymore and since you left i ve given up my days off it s what i need to stay strong i know you have a day job but mine is 24 7 i feel like writing a book i guess i lied in the hook cause i still love you and i need you by my side if i could the irony is if my career in music didn t exist in 6 years yeah you d probably be my wife with a kid i m frightened to think if i depend on cider and drink and lighting a spliff i fall into a spiral and it s just hiding my misguiding thoughts that i m trying to kill and i d be writing my will before i m 27 i ll die from a thrill go down in history as just a wasted talent can i face the challenge or did i make a mistake erasing it s only therapy my thoughts just get ahead of me eventually i ll be fine i know that it was never meant to be either way i guess i m not prepared but i ll say this these things happen for a reason and you can t change take my apology i m sorry for the honesty but i had to get this off my chest i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t want you no anymore i don t love you baby i don t need you baby i don t wanna love you no

weighted wings with its birds of prey circling overhead casting vulture shadows on barren beds let me out set me free let me out set me free the clock inside the church bell tower rings your name every hour i see your face i touch your hair then the ringing fades and nobody s there falling out of love is a treacherous thing with its crucible kiss and its ravaged ring with its holy whispers and labyrinth lies sacrilegious hungry sighs let me out set me free let me out set me free i walk the streets and i taste the dirt i am flesh and blood and my body hurts i search your silence looking for a crack for a passageway where i can pull you back falling out of love is a tedious thing with its jailhouse smirk and its chain gang swing its time to serve and its sentence set with its warm blood and cold sweat let me out set me free","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"suzanne takes you down to her place by the river you can hear the boats go by you can spend the night forever and you know that she s half crazy that s why you want to be there and she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from china and just when you want to tell her that you have no love to give her she gets you on her wavelength and lets the river answer that you ve always been her lover and you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind and you think you ll maybe trust her for she s touched your perfect body with her mind and jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water and he spent a long time watching from a lonely wooden tower and when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him he said all men shall be sailors then until the sea shall free them but he himself was broken long before the sky would open forsaken almost human he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone and you want to travel with him and you want to travel blind and you think you ll maybe trust him for he s touched your perfect body with his mind suzanne takes you down to her place by the river you can hear the boats go by you can spend the night forever and the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor and she shows you where to look amid the garbage and the flowers there are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning they are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever while suzanne holds the mirror and you want to travel with her and you want to travel blind and you

pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us we re still wearing our orange camp t shirts we still smell like pine needles i like you and you like me and i more than like you but i don t know if you do or don t more than like me you ve never said so i haven t been saying anything all summer content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me and choosing to do so again the next day and so on a girl who s smart and funny and who if i say something dumb for a laugh is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh but who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way i could never be a girl who reads books that no one s assigned to her whose curly brown hair has a line running through it from where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet back in the real world we don t go to the same school and unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood we won t go to the same high school so this is kind of it for us unless i say something and it might especially be it for us if i actually do say something the sun s gone down and the bus is quiet a lot of kids are asleep we re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop that looks like a kid we know and then i m like can i tell you something and all of a sudden i m telling you and i keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming and your face is there and gone and there and gone as we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway and there s no expression on it and i think just after a point i m just talking to lengthen the time where we live in a world where you haven t said yes or no yet and regrettably i end up using the word destiny i don t remember in what context doesn t really matter before long i m out of stuff to say and you smile and say okay i don t know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive and i would leave in order not to spoil the moment but there s nowhere to go because we re on a bus so i pretend like i m asleep and before long i really am i wake up the bus isn t moving anymore the domed lights that line the center aisle are all on i turn and you re not there then again a lot of kids aren t in their seats anymore we re parked at the pick up point which is in the parking lot of a methodist church the bus is half empty you might be in your dad s car by now your bags and things piled high in the trunk the girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time disembarking as i swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus just as one of them reaches my row it used to be our row on our way off it s michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week after throwing rocks at my head adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise she stops and looks down at me and her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so i can t really see her face but i can see her smile and she says one word destiny then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh and then she turns and leads them off the bus i didn t even know you were friends with them i find my dad in the parking lot he drives me back to our house and camp is over so is summer even though there s two weeks until school starts this isn t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad this is a story about how i learned something and i m not saying this thing is true or not i m just saying it s what i learned i told you something it was just for you and you told everybody so i learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always everybody can t turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows i told them but this means there isn t a place in my life for you or someone like you is it sad

out it s all part of the show fell in love with the fast life but started it slow loves creative types slept with every artist she know comes from high society but they frown on her actions instagrams half naked how she sounds in her captions always snobby and conceited she knows what the deal is wants to party thumbs through a rolodex full of dealers yeah cause she said the high was divine the first time is what she kept on searching trying to find scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside couldn t face the truth but everyone s got something to hide it s ironic how conscious she is of how she appear two hours getting dressed but still can t look herself in the mirror making poor choices even at her wealthiest year was a fast lifestyle that no one helped her to steer yeah
