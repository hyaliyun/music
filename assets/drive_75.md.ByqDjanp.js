200 bce when king antiochus iii the great of syria defeated king ptolemy v epiphanes of egypt at the battle of panium judea became at that moment part of the seleucid empire of syria king antiochus iii the great wanting to conciliate his new jewish subjects guaranteed their right to live according to their ancestral customs and to continue to practice their religion in the temple of jerusalem however in 175 bce antiochus iv epiphanes the son of antiochus iii invaded judea ostensibly at the request of the sons of tobias the tobiads who led the hellenizing jewish faction in jerusalem were expelled to syria around 170 bce when the high priest onias and his pro egyptian faction wrested control from them the exiled tobiads lobbied antiochus iv epiphanes to recapture jerusalem as the ancient jewish historian flavius josephus tells us the king being thereto disposed beforehand complied with them and came upon the jews with a great army and took their city by force and slew a great multitude of those that favored ptolemy and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy he also spoiled the temple and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months when the second temple in jerusalem was looted and services stopped judaism was outlawed in 167 bce antiochus ordered an altar to zeus erected in the temple he banned circumcision and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple antiochus s actions provoked a large scale revolt mattityahu a jewish priest and his five sons jochanan simeon eleazar jonathan and judah led a rebellion against antiochus judah became known as yehuda hamakabi by 166 bce mattathias had died and judah took his place as leader by 165 bce the jewish revolt against the seleucid monarchy was successful the temple was liberated and new holy vessels were made according to the talmud olive oil was needed for the menorah in the temple which was required to burn throughout the night every night the story goes that there was only enough oil to burn for one day yet it burned for eight days the time needed to prepare a fresh supply of oil for the menorah an eight day festival was declared by the jewish sages to commemorate this miracle","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"christmas is the time to say i love you christmas is the time to say i love you share the

and also when she comes down hate keeps his head up and walks through the street every stranger and drifter he greets and shakes hands with every loner he meets with a serious look on his face love arrives safely with suitcase in tow carrying with her the good things we know a reason to live and a reason to grow to trust to hold to care hate sits alone on the hood of his car without much regard to the moon or the stars lazily killing the last of a jar of the strongest stuff you can drink love takes a taxi a young man drives as soon he sees her hope fills his eyes but tears follow after at the end of the ride because he might never see her again hate gets home lucky to still be alive he screams over the sidewalk and into the drive the clock in the kitchen says two fifty five and the clock in the kitchen is slow love has been waiting patient and kind just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign that the one that she cares for who s out of his mind will make it back safe to her arms hate stumbles forward and leans in the door weary head hung down eyes to the floor he says love i m sorry and she says what for i m yours and that s it whatever i should not have been gone for so

this would go down so easy well you can huff and you can puff and try and blow my house down but i take comfort in the fact that i have stolen your crown go ahead with the childish games you play and at the end of the day we ve got the final say i bet you never saw this coming the tensions rise in your mind and you think back to realizing everything that you left behind the mask that you wear is

said why i said come on and take a ride with a helluva guy she said how do i know you re not sick you could be some deranged lunatic i said c mon toots my name is the prince besides would a lunatic have a porsche like this she agreed and we were on our way she was looking very good and so was i i must say word we hit mcdonald s pulled into the drive we ordered two big macs and two large fries with cokes she kicked her shoes off onto the floor she said drive fast speed turns me on she put her hand on my knee i put my foot on the gas we almost got whiplash i took off so fast the sunroof was open the music was high and this girl s hand was steadily moving up my thigh she had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far i guess that s why i didn t notice that police car we re doing ninety

why you said goodbye you ll hear an old familiar sound and hope it s her when you turn around but never never on the day you leave love grows in the time it s been since you last heard her sing she ll cut her hair and move somewhere she don t owe you anything no it s never on the day you leave you can tell how it s gonna be to watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes you wish you d given her one more kiss to put away for a night like this but never never on the day you leave love grows in the time it s been since you last held her hand she ll fight for you like hell then force herself to like some other man no it s never on the day you leave that you remember christmas eve and all the things you miss about her crazy family you ll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store christmas tree but never never on the day you leave no never never on the day you leave so maybe it d be better off to write her and leave a little note right there beside her that says maybe we re not perfect but i ll be damned if i ever leave damned if i ever leave damned if i ever leave2","artist_name":"John Mayer"},{"lyrics":"oh honey you don t have to try so hard to hurt me don t worry i
