egrets heads and open arms whistling through his pensive teeth the scene is set to peak like how the desert meets the reef and steals the heart of the thief she walks slow past the reach of home in a western world far from the things she knows hanging gardens patterned walls the books of rilke orchestras motioning to the slow refrain the soul is set to gain or swallow it whole the causal chain of human loam and as seasons go it s a lot like this he reasons for a look then a glance to the path where she passed from the page of a book to a perch in the grass and as meetings go it s a lot like

to talk to i won t doubt you doubt in you doubt in you and if i let you know i won t be alone i won t be alone and if you as if you start to fall i ll be here to catch you turning around he sighs will you sit next to me motioning forward she replies will you walk next to me i know my lines and there s a lot less space and a little bit of time i know the play it s fine echoing herself she says will you walk close to me holding his smile he replies what more would you ask of me i know my mind and there s a lot less space and a little bit of time i know the way it s fine  and if you let me know i won t be alone i won t be alone and if you have the time to talk to i won t doubt you doubt in you doubt in you and if i let you know i won t be alone i won t be alone and if you as if you start to fall i ll be here to catch you he s wasting time you gotta take it slow may never get a chance like this and she knows he s wasting time and she loves the way he tries even though she knows the lines she s taking time you gotta let things grow may never have a chance like this and he knows she takes her time and he keeps along her side all hopes to keep along her side and as seasons go it s a lot like this he reasons for a look then a glance to the path where she passed from the page of a book to a perch in the grass and as meetings go it s a lot like this she tiptoes from the path to the edge

jars these accidents of faith and nature they tend to stick in the spokes of you but every now and then the trend bucks and you re repaired by more than glue worry not everything is sound this is the safest place you ve found the only noise beating out is ours lacing our tea from honey jars why don t you rest your fragile bones a minute ago you looked alone stop waving your arms you re safe and

to die in our sleep while these machines will rust i promise but we ll still be electric shocking each other back to life your hand in mine my fingers and your veins connected our bones grown together in time our hands entwined and my fingers and your veins connected our spines grown stronger inside cause i know that our church is all made out of shipwrecks from every hull these rocks have claimed but we pick ourselves up and try and grow better through this change so come on and let s wash each other with tears of joy and tears of grief and fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this

s a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair don t have the inclination to look back on any mistake like cain i now behold this chain of events that i must break in the fury of the moment i can see the master s hand in every leaf that trembles and in every grain of sand oh the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear like criminals they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer the sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way to ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay i gaze into the doorway of temptation s angry flame and every time i pass that way i always hear my name then onward in my journey i come to understand that every hair is numbered like every grain of sand i have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night in the violence of a summer s dream in the chill of a wintry light in the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space in the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face i hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea sometimes i turn there s someone there other times it s only me i am hanging in the balance of a perfect finished plan like every

no normal times my friends i can see the storm clouds gathering try to close your eyes to the ignorance and lies but it still feels like a heavy load greed and fear are the seeds that appear to have taken root through our garden right here these sights and sounds were draggin me down so i went out upon the road i went out across the ocean out to thailand and cambodia out to katmandu sri lanka through tibet and then down to india and up on a hill in rishikesh i came across a holy man with shining eyes and a toothless smile he grinned and this is what he said there s nothing so tall we can t climb over there s nothing so wide we can not cross the time has come to raise your voices the light burns brightest when all hope seems lost be fearless and play even though we never seem to have it all together still i know with us all together we could have it all be fearless and play you could live for tomorrow and still live here in today when i would play when i was a child i swore that i would never forget no i will never forget no be fearless and play this is one thing that no one can ever take away1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"by the waters edge the current running swift she sat down for a minute trying to catch her breath she said why am i so alone why are we all so alone the floods came and divided us long ago nobody knew how to swim stranded on islands of their own she said i will no longer cling to this shore of isolation anymore she just jumped on in the current pulled and twisted knocked on rocks and flipped and lifted rolling through the rapids feel like drowning head is pounding lights surrounding starting to float starting to float drifting with the current learning not to control there s no way out but th快re s a way in there s no way out but th快re s a way in side oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh with the source of her homeland drifting out of sight she had never seen the constellations burning so bright new islands coming up over the horizon

please come teach us come and save us free us from all that enslaves us show us how you learned to do this please oh master help us through this oh she just smiled and she said my friends i am not a
