didn t stop survivor s guilt going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned or maybe how a 1 my foundation was but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city i was entering a new one a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned the word was respect just because you wore a different gang color than mine s doesn t mean i can t respect you as a black man forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us but i don t know i m no mortal man maybe i m just another nigga shit and that s all i wrote i was gonna call it another nigga but it ain t really a poem i just felt like it s something you probably could relate to other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground what you mean by that what the ground represent the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil right that s how i see it my word is bond i see and the ground is the symbol for the poor people right the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people cause the rich people gonna be so fat and they gonna be so appetizing you know what i m saying wealthy appetizing the poor gonna be so poor and hungry right you know what i m saying it s gonna be like you know what i m saying it s gonna be there might there might be some cannibalism out this muh fu they might eat the rich you know what i m saying aight so let me ask you this then do you see yourself as somebody that s rich or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities i see myself as a natural born hustler a true hustler in every sense of the word i took nothin i took the opportunities i worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it i went from having somebody managing me to me hiring the person that works my management company i changed everything i realized my destiny in a matter of five years you know what i m saying i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people now it s time to make millions for myself you know what i m saying i made millions for the record companies i made millions for these movie companies now i make millions for for us and through your different avenues of success how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity by my faith in god by my faith in the game and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true right you know what i m saying and it was happening to me for a reason you know what i m saying i was noticing shit i was punching the right buttons and it was happening so it s no problem you know i mean it s a problem but i m not finna let them know i m finna go straight through would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall shit i like to think that at every opportunity i ve ever been uh threatened with resistance it s been met with resistance and not only me but it goes down my family tree you know what i m saying it s in my veins to fight back aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like we fighting a war i m fighting a war i can t win and i wanna lay it all down in this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength and that s right now while you a teenager while you still strong while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back cause once you turn 30 it s like they take the heart and soul out of a man out of a black man in this country and you don t wanna fight no more and if you don t believe me you can look around you don t see no loud mouth 30 year old motherfuckers that s crazy because me being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that there s nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores and next time it s a riot it s gonna be like uh bloodshed for real i don t think america know that i think america think we was just playing and it s gonna be some more playing but it ain t gonna be no playing it s gonna be murder you know what i m saying it s gonna be like nat turner 1831 up in this motherfucker you know what i m saying it s gonna happen that s crazy man in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations lot a people don t understand how important it is you know sometimes i can like get behind a mic and i don t know what type of energy i ma push out or where it comes from trip me out sometimes because it s spirits we ain t even really rappin we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us damn i wanted to read one last thing to you it s actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world it says the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city while consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him but praises the butterfly the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar but having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him he can no longer see past his own thoughts he s trapped when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city the result wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different they are one and the same what s your perspective on that pac pac pac 600","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"no no no no no no no i m looking for a band today i see the chivers anyway through my eyes oh oh oh i i m alone in life to say i love the chivers

never had a brother never had another man teach me how to be one yeah momma had a man but he was never calling me son and even if he did yo i would never take him serious cause people say they love me but it s funny cause i don t think they know what love really is cause love ain t when you hurt a person love ain t avoiding a problem you should be getting involved love ain t when you pick somebody up by the neck then you grab his head and you slam it right into the wall i was a troubled kid in school so i just kept to myself psychologists ordered me medicine it never did help cause every time i took it i was never myself i wasn t g i never had a strap next to my belt just a regular kid that never joined the sports team and every time i d tried to talk to a girl she d ignore me started hanging around stupid kids and broke a few laws had a few problems painted a few walls but one day something happened that changed my life forever something that i ll always remember i said one day something happened that changed my life forever something that i ll always remember check i was walking home after school with two friends from my class and then i seen a sketchy face walk past but at the time i didn t think of it much cause round here there s always sketchy cats tweakers and such so i just kept walking till i got to king s drive then seen a bunch of motherfuckers giving me the stink eye they started surrounding me stopped me in my place and right outside the circle i seen a familiar face a cat that i used to be tight with never had no problems with him but i guess he s smoking some nice shit he came right towards me i said fuck it then fine let s catch a fair one then caught a cheap shot from behind i ran they tripped me and caught me they stomped me and kicked me kicks to my face punches to my ribs and my kidneys then what happened next you just might not believe but everybody scattered i was trying to breathe students parents and teachers their watching me bleed but nobody did shit i was watching em leave as i was dying bleeding losing my conscious flashed backs of reminders of things i ve never accomplished everything turned white then everything was fine no more worries nothing on my mind no pain no nothing i guess it was my time then my whole life flashed right in front of my eyes but all of the sudden i snapped back to reality took a look around but no ambulance was surrounding me guess this is how it ends huh i guess this is what my momma meant when she said watch your friends huh guess i should have listened but now it s too late taking my last breath getting closer to my fate and right when i felt i was good with dying a voice in my head said don t stop keep trying so i got my ass up walked to school and dialed nine one one true story fuck what you think you could do for me fifteen years old just another victim just another kid that would end up dead or in prison got to the hospital the doctor said they don t know if i mma live immediate surgery tube through my ribs i could barely breathe i was bleeding out that s when i met god yeah i can see him now with a collapsed lung and two stab wounds i m losing blood quick but i ain t going that soon everybody left but i had strength in myself i mma be aight that s what i say to myself yeah and sure enough i kept on breathing almost paralyzed for the next three weekends private numbers calling death threats to my family even named my little sis so how can you be mad at me when i told you that i fear for our safety cause no street cred is worth my mothers place g they asked me who it was and i let em know i ain t ashamed of my choice and i don t regret it yo cause truth is i don t follow no one s rules i do what i feel s right i ain t no one s mule the whole thing

your beautiful don t ever let these fuckers tell you you re not and keep it going when they tell you to stop just an angel with broken wings the girl inside my dreams heaven must not be that far away because you fell from the top you fell and you fought why you stressed out about how you looking love walking around your city still feel like you ain t good enough why since you ve been on my mind i can t stop thinking bout your voice your smile your lips and your eyes don t need to lie you see i m tryna get a grip on you mind these other guys just tryna quick grip on your thighs sick of the lies i know your last man he just didn t show you the real you i see your soul your energy i can connect they feel you i mean feel in the spiritual sense way pass the physical your body don t need to be perfect for me to be into you i m into you i wanna show you my feelings that fit to you deep conversations you need someone to listen too someone who opens up at the same time pays attention to every word you say and understand how the things have been for you some people really got the word beautiful twisted see it s not your clothes body or lipstick that s materialistic beauty runs deeper than skin pass what the eyes can see deep inside your soul what tv wants you to be try to be like the skinny models in the magazines that doesn t flatter me cause what inside you is what matters see see baby you took a hundred pictures wasn t happy with one you tried on a hundred jeans you wasn t happy with none if you seen yourself through my eyes only then will you realize beauty isn t what you look like is but it s who you become i said you took a hundred pictures wasn t happy with one you tried on a hundred jeans you wasn t happy with none if you see yourself through my eyes cause only then will you realize beauty isn t what you look like it s who you become they say beauty is in the eyes of the beholder but sometimes the heart can see what invisible to the eyes you see everything on the outside is temporary the looks the appearance the makeup it s the beauty on the inside that truly lasts forever your flaws are what makes you perfect love every inch in your body head to your toe why when i look at you you get nervous self conscious about the way you look but girl you should know that your eyes are beautiful your smile is beautiful you can hold conversations baby your mind is beautiful know what your worth there s no one you needa prove it too and know what i mean when i say you re far from the usual i appreciate every single flaw in your body but they ain t flaws to me that s what makes you special i told the world so they can all see the stretch marks the split ends don t mean your ain t fine the crooked teeth that smile doesn t mean it don t shine listen i know it s hard to be different but must me hard not to be like these other girls but you gifted see i heard you wanted surgery but baby just listen all those things you feel you don t have ain t really missing they just ain t meant to be don t need to fix what they broken god made you perfectly like the skies and the oceans like the stars and the sunsets and the clouds and they skies couldn t name a thing i would change about you baby no lie why you looking on instagram at these models stop comparing yourself cause there s only one you in this world don t be scared of yourself and your face is covered in make up but you tryna hide i know it s hard to live with yourself when your dying inside but stop looking at yourself in the mirror picking your flaws out a million beautiful things about you i ll point them all out but i was guilty about not loving yourself too until until i met you  you baby you took a hundred pictures wasn t happy with one you tried on a hundred jeans wasn t happy with none if you see yourself through my eyes only then will you realize beauty isn t what you look like but it s who you become i said you took a hundred pictures wasn t happy with one you tried on a hundred jeans wasn t happy with none if you seen yourself through my eyes only then will you realize beauty isn t what you look like but it s who you become1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"we sending

time passes things change every day but wounds wounds heal but scars still remaining the same but tomorrow today s going down in flames throw the match set the past ablaze so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire from the heat exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief and as you say goodbye to the grief it s like watching the walls melt in your prison cell but you ve extinguished this livin hell still a little piece of you dies as you scream i m standin in the flames and it s a beautiful kind of pain settin fire to yesterday to find the light find the light find the light standin in the flames and it s a beautiful kind of pain settin fire to yesterday find the light find the light find the light i feel the burn watch the smoke as i turn rising a phoenix from the flames i have learned from fighting fights that weren t mine it s not with fists but with wings that i will fly and i m standin in the flames and it s a beautiful kind of pain settin fire to

made you ah now i don t wanna seem indulgent when i discuss my lows and my highs my demise and my uprise pray to god i just open enough eyes later on and gave you the supplies and the tools to

goldfish bowl gets old but especially when you don t know if your conscience is sayin i told you so cause you don t even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier or you sold your soul  i know it s a fine fine line living in hope or dire need i know it s a fine fine line living in hope or dire need and from here you look so small hovering high above us all please come back to me i still remember the times when they were simpler than the rhymes of vanilla ice were when i was just killin the mics i ll never forget what that feeling was like i miss those times now when i was just starting out without a dime and now i m diamond i can t even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when i ve been stuck in this house hibernatin hate even going outside it sucks sometimes i just wanna walk into target and look at shit and browse i don t even want to buy nothin i just wanna fuckin walk around inside it look how excited i sound when i get to talkin bout life and everything about it i miss which now reminds me put a thousand lighters in the sky for the outsidaz wow i must have had alzheimer s long time since i shouted them out bout time cause it s been on my mind lately how zee you always supported me you vouched i will never forget that and how you guys accepted me for me and pace i love you too you slept on my couch and i ve been thinkin bout the time when i slept on the floor at the outhouse rhyming s all we ever wanted to do and regardless how life has turned out inside i ll i ll always be an outsider my life has been turned inside out but i i know it s a fine fine line living in hope or dire need i know it s a fine fine line living in hope or dire need but i keep walkin the line 102","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"you are gracious in majesty you re the mighty and

full of saliva my knife is out and i m duckin on the side of your house see it s sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain t here for your empathy i don t need your apology or your friendship or sympathy it s revenge that i seek so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potential i peeked continue to peep still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak all the way round to the back porch man door handles unlocked shouldn t be that easy to do this you don t plan for intruders beforehand surprised to see me cat got your tongue gag chloroform rag dag almost hack up a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans irony s spectacular huh now who s a faggot you punk and here s your bronco hat you can have that shit back cause they suck it s just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it we re in a car right now wait here comes my favorite lyric i m the bad guy who makes fun of people that die and hey here s a sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy how s this for a publicity stunt this should be fun last album now cause after this you ll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell bitch i even have your initials i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it since you re in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits time is quite near hope we don t get stopped no license i fear that sirens i hear guess ninety on the freeway wasn t the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver s side mirror hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least new plan stan slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car well gotta go almost at the bridge ha ha big bro it s for you slim this is for him and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again part 2 produced by streetrunner i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i m the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i m

approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it s over here we go all over again back s to the wall i m stackin up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i m talkin a lot of shit but i m backin it all up but in my head there s a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i m the ringing in your ears i m the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i m your time that s almost up that you haven t acknowledged grab for some water but i m that pill that s too jagged to swallow i m the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin back on ya every woman you insult batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper s persona is half a facade and matthew and stan s just symbolic of you not knowin what you had til it s gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i m the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i m the future that s here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don t stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can t call it quits when it s time to walk away i m every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there s anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then don t bother so fore you rest your case better make sure you re packing a wallop so one last time i m back fore it fades into black and it s all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait

when we left the club at the rap genius house me and shawty got into a fight she came out the room swinging hit me in the jaw i was really tryna fend her off but i ended up in the closet with my hands around her neck i was tripping dawg too proud to apologize or empathize i blamed it all on her saying that she hit me first even though she was the one hurt i was really just reflecting all the hurt that i was feeling from the band s rejection when kids these days split that shit felt like a c section and my infidelity and jealousy with natalie on top of the amphetamines and the ecstasy had me tryna drown face down in the chesapeake the next month i dropped down on my luck and had europe going nuts but i couldn t even appreciate it at the time i was going through too much now i had to

a song that i couldn t finish that i wrote about signin to the roc isn t that ironic i was feeling so psychotic with the whole world excited for me and my idol saying i got it shit got bad out in l a so i moved back home to my mom s basement linked up with smoko and papi beatz and took it back to basics then i wrote rage that was me screaming out through the pain and u mad addressing my relationship with natalie it was too bad the violence and the lies slipped suicide into my mental health i did acid in the studio one day and almost killed myself as i started to fall apart certain stars started to align om mas came to chicago in january at the perfect time he said kanye was working on an album and uzi played him one of our songs he was tryna fly me out nigga it was goin down

ounce of hope to get you through anything it s being in tune with the song you know the one we re all trying to sing i guess hope is knowing that someone loves me hope is hearing your voice hope

when my people understood their prominence and my past life visions of the continent like the first time i saw krs live rockin it i heard resurrection by common sense dominant in my psyche i chose my
