the church bells all were broken and the three men i admire most the father son and the holy ghost they caught the last train for the coast the day the music died and there i stood alone and afraid i dropped to my knees and there i prayed and i promised him everything i could give if only he would make the music live and he promised it would live once more but this time one would equal four and in

always winter but never christmas it seems this curse just can t be lifted yet in the midst of all this ice and snow our hearts stay warm cause they are filled with hope it d be so nice to look out the window and see the leaves on the trees begin to show the birds would congregate and sing a song of birth a song of newer things the wind would come and the sun would shine i d go outside and i d squint my eyes but for now i will simply just withdraw sit here and wish for this world to thaw it s always winter but never christmas it seems this curse just can t be lifted yet in the midst of all this ice and snow our hearts stay warm cause they are filled with hope and everything it changed overnight this dying world you brought it back to life and deep inside i felt things shifting

about d nice melodie and scott la rock i ll get a pen a pencil a marker mainly what i write is for the average new yorker some mcs be talking and talking trying to show how black people are walking but i don t walk this way to portray or reinforce stereotypes of today like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon talk broken english and drug selling see i m telling and teaching pure facts the way some act in rap is kind of wack and it lacks creativity and intelligence but they don t care cause their company s selling it it s my philosophy on the industry don t bother dissing me or even wishing we d soften dilute or commercialize all the cause it s about time one of y all hear it and hear it first hand from an intelligent brown man a vegetarian no goat or ham or chicken or turkey or hamburger cause to me that s suicide self murder let us get back to what we call hip hop and what it meant to dj scott la rock  in about four seconds a teacher will begin to speak how many mcs must get dissed before somebody says don t f with kris this is just one style out of many like a piggy bank this is one penny my brother s name is kenny that s kenny parker my other brother i c u is much

that i didn t see any chance because i was living in a little town was studying and when i finally broke away from school and became a musician i thought well now i may have a little bit of a chance because all i really wanted to do is music and not only play music but compose music at that time in germany in 69 70 they had already discotheques so i would take my car would go to a discotheque sing maybe thirty minutes i think i had about seven eight songs i would partially sleep in the car because i didn t want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning i wanted to do an album with the sounds of the 50s the sounds of the 60s of the 70s and then have a sound of the future and i said wait a second i know the synthesizer why don t i use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future and i didn t have any idea what to do but i knew i needed a click so we put a click on the 24 track which then was synced to the moog modular i knew that could be a sound of the future but i didn t realize how much the impact would be my name is giovanni giorgio but everybody calls me giorgio once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct you can do whatever you want so nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do40","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there are so many things that i don t

one if you re a jew but what if i were to tell you there s a fresh third part out there which was found by a hip new prophet who had a little donny osmond flair have you heard of the all american prophet the blond haired blue eyed voice of god he didn t come from the middle east like those other holy men no god s favorite prophet was all american i m gonna take you back to biblical times 1823 an american man named joe livin on a farm in the holy land of rochester new york elder cunningham you mean the mormon prophet joseph smith elder price that s right that young man spoke to god elder cunningham he spoke to god elder price and god said joe people really need to know that the bible isn t two parts there s a part three to the bible joe and i god have anointed you to dig up this part three that s buried by a tree on a hill in your backyard elder cunningham wow god says go to your backyard and start digging that makes perfect sense elder price joseph smith went up on that hill and dug where he was told and deep in the ground joseph found shining plates of gold joseph smith what are these golden plates who buried them here and why elder price then appeared an angel his name was moroni moroni i am moroni the all american angel my people lived here long long ago this is a history of my race please read the words within we were jews who met with christ but we were all american but don t let anybody see these plates except for you they are only for you to see even if people ask you to show the plates to them don t just copy them onto normal paper even though this might make them question if the plates are real or not this is sort of what god is going for elder price joseph took the plates home and wrote down what he found inside he turned those plates into a book then he rushed into town and cried joseph smith hey god spoke to me and gave me this blessed ancient tome he commanded me to publish it and stick it in ev ry home elder cunningham wow so the bible is actually a trilogy and the book of mormon is return of the jedi i m interested elder price now many people didn t believe the prophet joseph smith they thought he made up this part three that was buried by a tree on the hill in his backyard but joe said joseph smith this is no lie i speak to god all the time and he told me to head west so i ll take my part three from the hill with the tree feel free if you d like to come along with me to the promised land paradise on the west coast nothing but fruit and fields as far as the eye can see all have you heard of the all american prophet he found a brand new book about jesus christ we re following him to paradise we call ourselves mormon and our new religion is all american elder cunningham wow how much does it cost elder price the mormons kept on searching for that place to settle down but every time they thought they found it they got kicked out of town and even though people wanted to see the golden plates joseph never showed em gotswana i have maggots in my scrotum elder price um okay well anyway now comes the part of our story that gets a little bit sad on the way to the promised land mormons made people mad joseph was shot by an angry mob and knew he d soon be done joesph smith you must lead the people now my good friend brigham young oh god why are you letting me die without having me show people the plates they ll have no proof i was telling the truth or not they ll have to believe it just cause oh i guess that s kinda what you were going for blargggh elder price the prophet joseph smith died for what he believed in but his followers they kept heading west and brigham young led them to paradise a sparkling land in utah they called salt lake city and there the mormons multiplied and made big mormon families generation to generation until finally they made me and now it s my job to lead you where those early settlers were led long ago all have you heard of the all american prophet the next in line to be
