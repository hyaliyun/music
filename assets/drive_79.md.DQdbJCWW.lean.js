coulda turned out to be if i da stayed and weren t heard what would amount to me if i had looked and ain t found what i have found in me i mean inside would they love me never looked down on me they say you know if you loved her well then you would have stayed you could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn t trade trade for nothing i did though i had to chase it face it i wasn t born to live a life basic they say you turned your back on us just to go and be an artist what s a promise anyway when someone breaks it i bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it i bet he don t come back for us when he makes it and if he do it d be too late you gotta face it cause by then there s someone new you been replaced with old friends i grew up with the girl i fell in love with love or hate me depending on how you judge it even if i don t stay everything will be okay everything will be okay everything will be okay i had to wander i had to go tread my own path if you don t step through no mud well then it won t last the years pass it s crazy how they go fast ask myself questions you have but that you won t ask like you don t even come home enough where were you when she was in the hospital huh it was only us and that s deep and yeah i know it cuts but if that gets you then you re weak cause we were here and it ain t broken us still as close and stayed by her side when no one was like when she lost her job and everything how broke we was when she was sick and she needed some taking care of a fifteen year old shouldered the weight and what he was scared of the worst i know that you stayed strong i don t say this enough but you made me just as proud as you made mom yeah you got some anger but i don t blame you at all i know i don t call but you re my brother i love ya  even if i don t stay everything will be okay everything will be okay everything will be okay yeah in that first grade class they came and got me your mom s outside say goodbye now to everybody u haul was waiting with all of her things at least what she could pack in the time my dad s at work and before he came back way too young to comprehend what was happenin are we going to grandma s when are we coming back again little did i know that we were leaving him by himself and ten years would pass before mom sees anybody else just us in middle school i ain t understand who melissa was and why she wasn t another man biased and confused they try explain but nobody can wanted what i thought was normal she had another plan such is life even if it took time for me to accept it no longer dad now but a woman with whom she slept with over the years when a secret was how she kept it i ain t get it admittedly i was skeptic i came around happiness i see s what you may have found and that s what s most important i don t wanna see you breaking down i wanna see you smile i don t wanna see you make a frown if she loves you then that s all anybody needs maybe now by 05 things had gotten worse moved to the basement deep depression s a rotten curse hidin in a dark space her mind and her body hurts becomin more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts so the worse it got i became more and more afraid until one night i went into that room on the floor she laid i shook her she was blue her skin was cold and she wasn t breathin screamed melissa wake up couldn t fathom that she was leavin mom and bro was runnin down i screamed somebody help try pumping her chest cpr but it didn t help toughest pill to swallow but we lost that s forced reflection while in her life you made her happy

you leave me no choice i m about to bring noise got to fill this void i got to be the voice yeah yeah yeah i said leave me no choice about to bring noise got to fill this void i got to be the voice what the government is doin amongst our people is downright evil disturbin but not surprisin that s for certain with all of the conflict of propaganda i believe they are simply tryna slander start a civil war within the usa amongst black and white and those alike they are simply pushin us to our limit so that we can all get together and get with it they want us to rebel so that it makes easier for them to kill us and put us in jails alton sterlings are happenin every day in this country and around the world the scary part boys and girls is most of these stories don t make it to the news and reach mass consciousness it is for sure time that we as a people stand up for acknowledgement and accomplishment of what we call human rights it is time to rebel better yet raise hell i just want everyone to be cautious about how they go about it because this is all part of the government s plan and what they been plottin they re literally beggin for this to happen so they can kill us off usin uprisin and rebellion as the excuse in a timely fashion the cancerous foods the chemical warfare economic sufferin is not workin fast enough there are many steps ahead of us and manifestin the future that they want we have to work together not only rattlin them on a physical plane but to outsmart them on an intellectual mental level the same as black men i think our gangs need to do a better job at protectin us the people our communities and not assistin in destroyin them brutally it s time to even the score cause who do we call when the police break the law we are so quick to pick up a gun and kill one another but not quick enough to pick it up and protect each other the code words to killin a black man by police is he s got a gun damned if he do damned if he don t damned if he runs or what about them them murderers got it we need solutions you better start plottin now it s always been clear that they don t value our lives my people been sufferin way too long and i m tired of singin the same old song people actin like this shit isn t happenin it s downright wrong justice won t be served by a hashtag and that s the very reason i ask that what are we to do we re scattered around with no clue of this ugly truth all we know is who they ridiculed and who gets minisculed time to wake the fuck up and do our own research and not form opinions based on just what we ve heard ameri k

hands be steady when i lay down my fears my hopes and my doubts the rings on my fingers and the keys to my house with no hard feelings when the sun hangs low in the west and the light in my chest won t be kept held at bay any longer when the jealousy fades away and it s ash and dust for casual lust and it s just hallelujah and love in thoughts and love in the words love in the songs they sing in the church and no hard feelings lord knows they haven t done much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold with so much to have and hold mmm hmm  when my body won t hold me anymore and it finally lets me free where will i go will the trade winds take me south through georgia grain or tropical rain or snow from the heavens will i join with the ocean blue or run into a savior true and shake hands laughing and walk through the night straight to the light holding the love i ve known in my life and no hard feelings lord knows they haven t done much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold with so much to have and hold under the curving sky i m finally learning why it matters for me and you to say it and mean it too for life and its lovely nest and all of its ugliness good as it s been to me i have no enemies i have no enemies i ll have no enemies i have no enemies1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"there s a party in the house and we ll be rockin tonight so bring your body with you baby and i
