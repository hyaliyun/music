bloodthirstiest viking of them all he had a hairy head a hairy face hairy chest hairy legs hairy boots and a hairy hat shaped like a big bullet with horns comin out the sides and once he started after ya he d never stop he d turn to his oarsmen in his 37 oared fj ord and he d say morden borden fjorden gorden which was viking for ya hoo ravage pillage plunder maim and put big hickeys on all them

sneakers by your side yes and when the villagers heard that awful battle cry ya hooooooooooo that s the one they would run for their lives fleeing over hills and thru valleys to the river whereupon they would walk mid stream for 37 and 1 2 miles climbing out on the low lying branch shinnying down a young sapling onto rocky ground and leaping from stone to stone until they arrived one week later at a secret cave 97 miles away and as they sat down for the first time to catch their breath outside they heard  ya hoooo morden borden fjorden gorden chorus yes it was erik the awful the brutal and tenacious erik the awful turned up in the darndest places subtle as a chainsaw lacking all the social graces you can run but you cannot hide oh and this time they cut south to paris bought tickets on

hickey party on the outskirts of what is now washington dc where the decendants of erik can still be found today working as special agents for the irs erik later amassed a small fortune posing for

is all i have to say i used to stay awake and wonder praying for the day when you would notice me but now i m slowly noticing that while you were my world you weren t the one and now my searching days are done you are the one that got away you are the one that i let go of i m so glad you ran away because i know i never could ve told you face to face i started thinking things were never gonna change that i would never find someone cause it was far too late but then she showed up when i was let down i felt my heart jump she helped me up from the ground and said this is it this is all i have to say i used to stay awake and wonder praying for the day that i would find you but now it s come true and i swear i m here to stay and if you left me i would say you are the one that got away you are the

shifting numb and sore parts when you can no longer sit them foot on the dash foot on the dash x hours or so from some somewhere now only half aware when i change lanes half accidentally vision fixed in the distance identifying wildflowers and then i almost touch your leg but something stays me the economy of love in close quarters a learned thing in contrast i am marked quietly alone of the small rented spaces we have slept in tents even sometimes in this tiny capsule but hurtling uncertain into the inferno of forever of here which it does to me the desert it has effects makes me mark things needlessly the immensity of breath is all i guess overamplifying overconnecting makes me see all small simplicities significant substantial makes me seek out symbolism search in the symmetry for some lost stigmas of the self these words that hiss or makes snake sounds but it feels holy almost though i don t say so a native sense but not skeletons and headdresses no projections found in thunder clouds shaped by soundless lightning it is an extra sense a pentecostal thing unnamable and great an immortal unknowing sacred and ancestral and real and only felt here when the sun falls only felt here now where the otherworldly haunts of coming dusk descending from immeasurable spaces to more immeasurable spaces an ancient endless desert sprawl anarchic forever interrupted only by this highway running west some wound maybe or a bandage depending on how you look at it or maybe just what must marry the two vast expanses a mirror reflecting both sides or a path more than anything but who cares what a bridge through the history of a place where a watch doesn t work a guide through wider spaces than the baggage of unclaimed except in concrete a place you might claim one day some day you and i for us when we get to wherever it is we are going and you speak and alone single landmark in memorial now and the landscape that always passes but never passes does finally and we see time again for remember the mirror pointing backwards all of a sudden watching the paintbrush shrinking at last light and then i think again to touch your leg but something stays me some voice yours and mine combined and the rain to come sang quiet first and then just so i crack my window just so almost close my eyes and almost let go of the steering wheel but don t it feels impossible for me to crash the car when we are in it1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"delta dawn what s that flower you have on could it be a faded rose from days gone by and did i hear you say he was a meeting you here today to take

synonymous with the spirit of our country founding fathers of the u s a over 200 years ago they shook off the chains of tyranny from great britain by divine call citing 27 biblical violations they

light or since give me liberty or give me death patrick henry said our country was founded on the gospel of jesus christ we eliminated god from the equation of american life thus eliminating the reason this nation first began from beyond the grave i hear the voices of our founding fathers plead you need god in america again of the 55 men who formed the constitution fifty two were active members of their church founding fathers like noah webster who wrote the first dictionary could literally quote the bible chapter and verse james madison said we ve staked our future on our ability to follow the ten commandments with all our heart these men believed you couldn t even call yourself an american if you subvert the word of god in his farewell address washington said you can t have national morality apart from religious principle and it s true cause right now we have nearly 150 000 kids carrying guns to these war zones we call public schools in the 40 s and 50 s student problems were chewing gum and talking in the 90 s rape and murder are the trend the only way this nation can even hope to last this decade is put god in america again the only hope for america is jesus the only hope for our country is him if we repent of our ways stand firm and say we need god in america again abe lincoln said the philosophy of the classroom in one generation will be the philosophy of government of the next so when you eliminate the word of god from the classroom and politics you eliminate the nation that word protects america is now number one in teen pregnancy and violent crime

want god in america again i believe it s time for america to stand up and proclaim that one nation under god is our demand and send this evil lifestyle back to satan where it came from and let the word of god revive our dying land for jesus christ is coming back again in all his glory and every eye shall see him on that day that s why a new anointing of god s power s coming on us to boldly tell the world you must be saved because astrology won t save you your horoscope won t save you the bible says these things are all a farce if you re born again you don t need to look to the stars for your answers cause you can look to the very one who made those stars history tells us time and time again to live like there s no god makes you a fool if you want to see kids live right stop handing out

that my best friend died for weeks i sat alone in my room and cried and i tried to pretend everything was fine but my soul couldn t rest until vengeance was mine a year to this day that my best friend died for weeks i sat alone in my room and cried and i tried to pretend everything was fine but my soul couldn t rest until vengeance was mine the day began with me standin at his grave with his mother his old girlfriend his two younger brothers we said a few words faces covered with tears on how we missed him so much and we wished he was here then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone and we said our goodbyes and they all went home i thought i d use this time for me and him to be alone i broke out the hen poured a little out for him told him who was gettin married who had went to the pen how the homie named his newborn son after him but as the sun went down our talk came to an end so i said a quick prayer amen and i shook in the lac cross the railroad tracks and i headed up la brea saw the homie isaiah i asked him what he doin he was way out of bounds he said he had a freak that lived on that side of town but he always kept the heat just in case it went down i clown then i rolled down my window bout to light a ciga hey is that that nigga gimme your motherfucking gun right now man drive around the block and post up for a minute i hit you on the chirp hit the corner nigga bend it splendid now with vengeance in my grasp i couldn t dream of a better day for me to catch his ass slippin while he dip into the ride by himself i slid up behind him in the shadows hella stealth he started to break hisself i said i didn t want a dime do you remember what you was doin last year about this time he looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise i split his face with the glock right before he could reply he cried as i pressed the heat against his cheek then i squoze two times for the homie rest in peace it was a year to this day that my best friend died for weeks i sat alone in my room and cried and i tried to pretend everything was fine but my soul couldn t rest until vengeance was mine it was a year to this day that my best friend died and for weeks i sat alone in

to break me her whole family embraced me and i had been to more funerals than graduations a bit unusual but far from an exaggeration but death was something that was still new to her i had no idea what it would do to her the losses that she suffered forever changed how we interacted seems like our magic had flipped and turned tragic so end it while were still friends is what i suggested and she replied i was hoping that you would get the message  we love to live and live to love oh how tough it is to give it up when theres enough to get cant get enough and when it gets rough you ask yourself is this love i moved on from songstress to cheerleader older wiser and my gears cleaner cuts my baby locks now her family speaks to me got closer though we didnt hang out frequently stole my heart like she mastered thievery words cant describe what this girl means to me or meant to me it feels like centuries ago of course yo we broke up eventually you know easy come hey you know how the cliche

gaining fans i didnt even care when i started losing my friends i lost my own soul to the music i was producing my voice had no emotion my quality reducing i was drinking down my sorrows with a shot of tequila the burn in my throat was the only thing i was feeling i used so many people to have more personal gain and wondered what i did when i got treated the same i was a hypocrite and goddamn it im still doing it rap is childs play but i still refuse to lose in it i dont know at what point i lost myself on the track but now all i want to do is come back when you make up feeling wasted from drinking the night before miserable with how your life is laying on the floor youd walk to see a friend but you cant stand the motion so you just sit there like youre lost in the ocean thats the point in time where you know you need help so you cry out to the world that youre stuck in a hell but the people think its fake and dont listen to youre call matter of face there people never listened at all im desperate im lonely i just want someone to hold me but my bed is still empty at night and im still lonely this world is on my shoulders and i do my best to hold it but forgive me if you see me walk away for a moment im tired im not atlas i wasnt made to do this i was made to make music not to be left clueless i was made to help others not to be feeling helpless i gave it all i had and these people said i was selfish sometimes i listen to a track rewind it and play it back pause it at a point and be like nah that shits whack switch a bridge for a chorus but the tracks still boring so i cut it from the project before i finish recording cut it and re produce it rewrite until i lose it throw my phone at the wall but quickly i pursue it pick it up and try to use it and scream that i feel useless and thats my new process of how i create the music understand the mind of this maker has been tainted if i never get famous trust me ill always fake it but god if youre hearing this i honestly need you im running so thin that my hearts become see through i changed for the worse and they want the old me back i guess all i needed was someone to tell me that so i promise that i hear

nobody has ever walked on them they are waiting for the first explorers to straggle in from the reedy north and squat down here this minute in weary legions between the cathedral and the river at the gates of conquest they might enjoy a deep uninterrupted sleep to have been used so much and without mercy and still be capable of rediscovering in itself the old nakedness is what makes a friend of the city when sleep has failed i make through that nakedness to stumble on my own surprised to find a city is so like a man statues and monuments check me out as i pass clearing a space for myself the

youre telling me right now of how you think that it should be by the hand of democratic law and the hand of decency but your raging you wont talk law to me or tell me any stand youre pointing all the fingers but refuse to shake the hand instead of sitting content in your ideals and your laws you have to tell me what you see cause i can t see a lot but i see how democratic your law is when its revised and necessarily changed the irish were arrested without warrants because they were soldiers armed and estranged alls fair in love and war then they were tried without jury the act said fear of jurors death threats also no people could object to thee they were arrested under special laws and tried in diplock juries but when asked by amnesty or other countries they were criminalized as terrorists so you could ignore political talks and ignore political struggling so you can hold onto your colony without political juggling so you sat firm and quiet in your country and morals and common law promoting but nationalists kept coming bombs and people kept exploding the somazas crushed nicaragua the falklands angola and nambia south africa they fought you tooth and nail till they were crushed or you gave up youre not a democracy you re a capitalist empire that colonizes weaker lands and taxes natural resource oil diamonds copper exchanging hands you put in democratic so called governments as heads of the state that are willing to adhere to your bidding and reap measly profits from their state and you colonize them with phone companies hotels mcdonalds and nike plants and erect military bases under the pretense of defense but the truth is its defense from revolution in case the poor rise up against the governments youve helped to empower and make the final stop then you called them a communist menace and stage and attack from your own bases then the government death squads destroy their empty faces you sent embargos on countries who dont agree or finally do revolt a free country cant sell their natural resource on a global free market vote the countries that sit in the n a t o seats are the same domineering five and the butchers they empower keep the rest of the seats alive and the countries ostracized by embargo that form the rest of the world were forced to form a non aligned organization a union so they could be heard you call this a free market and your system democratic but its now a taxing empire that sends its shots out dead sporatic well you can take my contentment my sense of security you can beat me from head to toe till i bleed you can starve me or freeze me because it s all the same to me because in my mind i know i want to be free you sent your psychologist to evaluate me and give a report to the paper to read im more stable than he is i m beginning to see in this frustration of war its one purpose i see i know of your tactics to break people like me separate love forever im refused being seen in the maze of our

crushes my friends and me but i know in my mind that i want to be free you fought ireland as an organized army you fought them as a country but they fought you as a people and you were oblivious as to which serf was defending if you act like rats you get treated like this but now you are rebutting because we stood like a rock when for tactics and answers like rats you were scrambling what to report

if you re not already happy then sadness may be all you have ever known and you ll just have to learn to live with it within or you ll have to learn to change and begin again well this ring means i love you but there is no one above you you are closer to me than a friend and this ring i have shown you means i don t own you but i know our love could last til the end when you reflect someone else s life well that can cause all strife when there was nothing but domineering fighting when you were young so your relationship must work because your parents and you are a failure so to spite them you live through them showing them that yours is strong but then how did you get here this attraction to this one here the one it seems can never live up or is right you re embarrassing and hating yourself more but yet this feeling is familiar when you re raised in anxiety do you truly think that it s happiness that steers your sight humility is learning to be sad anxious and yearning to shut up and not believe that you deserve anything you can t do for yourself and never being too selfish to demand to be happy or to be served there is no reason to think that one person can satisfy you in every way of life it s only society that tells you that that s the way that is true it takes strength to be alone but your life could be more if you don t always conform you re already in love with more than one person although you may not think you can be for old loves reside most mostly in our memories but the fondness remains and it s still to them you would see this ring is a promise i am making to you to endeavor myself and sing for you to be happy and discover anyway i can try so my heart and friendship can stay true cause my loyalty lies with you and my love it will last til the end of time","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"well over the sea and far away our kids die in deserts they been sent that way to guard oil rigs where the head cutters reign and blow them away without any

crazy man that s creeping outside my door i live on the corner of grey street and the end of the world  there s an emptiness inside her and she d do anything to fill it in and though it s red blood
