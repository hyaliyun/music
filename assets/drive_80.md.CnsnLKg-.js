travels around the world was there anything left gentlemen i said i ve studied the charts and if what i am thinking is right there s another new world at the top of the world for the first one who breaks through the ice and i looked round the room in that way i once had and i saw that they wanted belief so i said all i ve got are my guts and my god then i paused and the annabelle lee oh the annabelle lee and i saw their eyes shine the most beautiful ship in the sea my ni?a my pinta my santa maria my beautiful annabelle lee that spring we set sail the crowds waved from the shore and on board the crew waved their hats but i never had family just the annabelle lee so i never had cause to look back i just set the course north and i d study the charts and towards dawn i drifted toward sleep and i dreamed of the fine deep harbor i d find past the ice for my annabelle lee after that it got colder the world got quiet it was never quite day or quite night and the sea turned the color of sky turned the color of sea turned the color of ice till at last all around us was vastness one vast glassy desert of arsenic white and the waves that once lifted us shifted instead into drifts against annabelle s side and the crew gathered closer at first for the warmth but each day would bring a new set of tracks in the snow leading over the edge of the world til i was the only one left then it gets cloudy but it feels like i laid there for days or maybe for months oh but annabelle held me the two of us happy just to think back on all we had done we talked of the other new worlds we d discover as she gave up her body to me and as i chopped up her mainsail for timber i told her of all that we still had to see as the frost turned her moorings to nine tail and the wind lashed her sides in the cold i burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold and i won t call it rescue that brought me back here to the old world to drink and decline and pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine but sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of some unknown tropical bird and i smile in my sleep thinking annabelle lee s finally made it to another new world yeah sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of some unknown tropical bird and i smile in my sleep thinking annabelle lee s finally made it to

but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once innocence disappeared by the age of eight years my pops shot up drug related mama addicted so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging blood was staining the concrete older niggas i loved talked like they was above maintaining a timesheet that s slow money picked up the family business by the age of 13 six years later was handed sentence round the same time is when you came in this world me and your mama thinking what the fuck we naming this girl i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was 19 took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked ass system set for me and now i fear it s too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me i m living fast but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me and if my past becomes the death of me i hope you understand  for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes do you understand me for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only it s several ways i could ve went out too many to count was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout was it the young niggas blasting frustrated cause the cash running out niggas don t know how to act in a drought see baby girl i realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed my views misshaped by new mixtapes that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true that real niggas don t speak when they beef with you they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops ducking rules hugging blocks that don t love you i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views much broader than the corner if not it s gon corner you into a box where your son don t even know his pops and the cyclical nature of doing time continues my worst fear is one day that you come home from school and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon and sadly if you re listening now it must mean it s true but maybe there s a chance that it s not and this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels and i can teach you this in person like i m teaching you to tie your own shoes i love you and i hope to god i don t lose you for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes for your eyes only for your eyes do you understand for your eyes only one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling what he d been dealing with lately he wasn t telling i tried to pick his brains still he wasn t revealing but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling he said jermaine i knew you since we was children i never asked for nothing when times was hard i never had discussions with you begging you to help me i dealt with the repercussions of my actions i know you tried to steer me way from that shit but that shit was in my blood you know my life i know your momma nigga send my love in case i never get a chance to speak again i won t forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib that s the way i wished my family lived but my granny crib was in the jects i had to interject like nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions but i been having premonitions just call it visions from the other side i got a feeling i won t see tomorrow like the time i m living on is borrowed with that said the only thing i m proud to say i was a father write my story down and if i pass go play it for my daughter when she ready and so i m leaving you this record for your eyes only don t you ever scratch or disrespect it this perspective is a real one another lost ville son i dedicate these words to you and all the other children affected by the mass incarceration in this nation that sent your pops to prison when he needed education sometimes i think that segregation would ve done us better although i know that means that i would never be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro with lil zach and cole world barely one years old now it s 30 years later making sure this story s told girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold not because he was the first to get some pussy 12 years old not because he used to come through in the caddy on some vogues not because he went from bagging up them grams to serving o s nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars not because he screamed fuck the law although that was true your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you for your eyes only226","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i

always on the move they got nothing left to lose cept their guns and their wounds now they re crossing borders sheriff s posse on their tail they d rather die together than be stuck up in a cell they drank up all the whiskey and they partied every night like it could be the last the bounty said to shoot on sight so they chased the endless summer knew it came with the pride they wouldn t stop running til they found their paradise but the sheriff finally found them with his eyes seeing red so the lovers had to shoot him down and fill him full of lead they were finally free to find a place to lay their head and when they finally did he looked at her and then he said  i said i think that we can stay here cause i feel our time has come and we can walk down to the ocean and sit with the rising sun so unpack your bags this instant no more running from town to town and now that we ve arrived so safely baby you can lay me down lay me down lay me down lay me down well you re my green

us believe we had the world in our hands we left home with nowhere to go facing our fears as we brave the unknown dear youth put back those thoughts in my head the ones where i believe that i am boundless again i know we re at the end of the road this is our story this was our home  we were unbreakable alive and well the days are shrinking alive and well each moment more fleeting alive and well we gave our best alive and well you know the rest5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"man i got that swag my hat matches my bag you know i m popping tags cause man i got that swag man i got that swag

about 1990 shady grove hospital in rockville maryland 7 36 a m where a biracial baby was born to a black father and a white mother father that wasn t there addicted to crack cocaine alcohol and various other drugs same as his mom so i m gonna tell you about that right and i m gonna tell you about how all this young boy ever wanted was happiness all he ever wanted was positivity all he ever wanted to do was entertain and this boy went through hell you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy cause how in the fuck is you gonna have all these black babies with black men but you racist like bitch that don t make no sense but it is what it is you know he grew up her callin him a nigger the kids at school callin him a cracker identifying as black looking as white being told what you can or can t be this kid went through everything he went through he saw narcotics in the household violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped there was crazy shit that happened to this kid and he persevered while the whole world said what they said said you wouldn t be shit you ain t gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing and i and he he said fuck that i ma persevere and that s why the message is always peace love and positivity see he always saw things from two sides he always saw things from two sides he always knew that the message everybody was born equal regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation he knew that because he saw that because he was stripped and torn down by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated and that did not know and he was stripped and he was torn down by his white side that did not know these people that are ignorant that cannot see the bigger picture that must fight and kill and murder each other but once again all he ever wanted to do was spread a message of equality for every man woman and child regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation now imagine this child growing up and seeing the craziest shit being a part of the craziest shit running around with the wrong people running around with guns and knives and fighting and stealing and and all this because he didn t know he didn t know but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn t right and he knew that he needed to get away from it now i want you to also imagine that at 17 years old this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings and then he would then come home to about eight or nine hours of sleep but spend four five six hours of that working on music persevering grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people just chanting his name hoping that it would happen but the but the but the world said no mothafucka little mothafucka no no no no no no no no ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka no no and he said fuck that he said peace love and positivity he said equality for all man regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah now i want you to also imagine people telling him that he did not live this life you just a white boy you ain t never experienced that shit you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there oh no no we know we weren t there we didn t live with you we didn t live in your section 8 household we didn t live with the narcotics and violence in your household we just saw it from the outside outside outside outside outside outside outside outside and since you white you gotta have money right and this young man persevered in spite of what people told him he was wasn t and would never be and that man is here today proud a lover of all human beings regardless of race religion color creed sexual orientation yeah yeah and he s here to say even though we re all born and created equal we are not treated equally there s extremists on every side and you should just do your best to live life and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe as long as they re not hurtin anybody you can believe they re going to hell you can believe it s not

your days on the negative energy of others remember that you re not your salary you re not your house you re not your car and no matter how big your bank account is your grave is six feet under just like everyone else s so enjoy the days you have worry not about the days that came before you nor the ones that will follow you in death remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed and the fact that you are living is what life is all about so live your life to the fullest according to your happiness and the betterment of all kai damn man we ve been walking forever thomas well thalias tracking system says we ll be there in just over an hour kai shit at least we got good walking music or is that it thomas oh no man i m cueing up the fourth album now his final one one two three four one two three four listen look into my eyes tell me you could see beyond the smile that i m puttin on this front that i m puttin up for you i spill my soul into a microphone with poems written in blood in hopes that it s enough for you do you love me yet do you love me yet no okay i ll go harder for you in fact i rap till i collapse all i wanted was acceptance my latest lesson i ll never feel your approval till i accept my own come from a messed up home destitute and less informed about the ways to raise a child up to not become a product of his environment i need to cry and vent but i done built this wall up actin like everything s all good but in reality i m lookin for something through bumpin my favorite rappers i came up after nas cole and hov eyes closed i zone till five or so in the morn i m used to being alone shit you know how long i ve been out on my own chasing dreams fantasies of a throne one day i wake up and see that it didn t exist all along till then i will pen verses that fans consider brilliant boosting my ego with every million that spills in and still then i won t find solace so where s the logic in that worrying bout if they think logic can rap when it all just goes back to a childhood need to be loved by parents that was in too deep with the drugs nigga my advice fuck the black and white shit be who you are identify as a star no one tells you you re that it s something that you just know the world be stealing your glow your mama did what she could her life was miles from good your father fell in the trap they set for you when you black they met when they was low and therefore you a product of that and so your trauma is deep don t bury it you should weep and clean it out of your system then truly forgive em just my opinion only then can you find peace just start to notice happiness don t come from album release i ve been through it before can only share with you what i know to be true but at the same time i ll never be you and you ll never be me no matter how hard that you try this is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly the truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky but if you want to then you ought to know why are you running from something with hopes of becoming someone that s finally worthy of love let me tell you now you re worthy enough fuck approval from strangers that shit is dangerous as hell find god learn to accept yourself and i m gone acceptance64","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i don t know what i ma do i don t know where i ma live cause it feel like i ain t got

here i m not me i m not real nothing is nothing but this feeling of panic nobody understands nobody knows the sufferings this physical feeling it can t be anxiety it can t or can it can it in fact be the mind controlling the body yeah of course i m so in control of my mind and my body but i m subconsciously forcing myself into a state of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind i am unhappy not with life but with this feeling i am scared i am human i am a man but i look in the mirror and i see a child i am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit and they never did and it scares me cause now i m just a grown up who doesn t know shit but one thing is i do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me no no this feeling this anxiety is nothing i have anxiety just like you the person i wrote this for and together we will overcome this feeling we will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge that we are alive and any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted we will rejoice in this gift that is life we will rejoice in this day that we have been given we will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves starting with mental health we will accept ourselves as we are and we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror we will accept ourselves and live with anxiety32","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"and i miss you like that like this like that mmhm aha and i miss you right back remember that mhmm aha oh oh i m in the mist right now the mist i know

break there was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling it opened up the scars that had just finished healing it tore apart the canyon running down your femur i thought that it was beautiful it made me a believer and as it opened i could hear you howling from your room but i hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew when i reappeared and tried to give you something for the pain you came to hating me again and just sang your refrain you had a new dream it was more like a nightmare you were just a little kid and they cut your hair then they stuck you in machines you came so close to dying they should have listened they thought that you were lying your daddy was an asshole and he fucked you up built the gears in your head now he greases them up and no one paid attention when you just stopped eating eighty seven pounds and this all bears repeating tell me when you think that we became so unhappy wearing silver rings with nobody clapping when we moved here together we were so disappointed sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed it killed me to see you getting always rejected but i didn t mind the things you threw the phones i deflected i didn t mind you blaming me for your mistakes i just held you in the door frame through all of the earthquakes but you packed up your clothes in that bag every night i would try to grab your ankles what a pitiful sight but after over a year i stopped trying to stop you from stomping out that door coming back like you always do well no one s gonna fix it for us no one can you say that no one s gonna listen no one understands and so there s no open doors there s no way to get through there s no other witnesses just us two  there s two people living in one small room from your two half families tearing at you two ways to tell the story no one worries two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry two people talking inside your brain two people believing that i m the one to blame two different voices coming out of your mouth while i m too cold to care and too sick to shout had a new dream it was more like a nightmare you were just a little kid and they cut your hair then they stuck you in

going back and forth just askin me to send him beats and i m thinking he s trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you so won t you raise your glass won t you and um he was friends with my mentor no id and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap no id yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but he s like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer i m like oh shit i was messin with uh d dot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but that s how i got in the game if it wasn t for that i wouldn t be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn t poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off lay away get some jordans or something or get a technomarine that s what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone he s like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really weren t soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic 2001 at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now it s kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this can t be life and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i m sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there s a time in every man s life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay z and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jay z i ain t want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it and i was like man that shit tight you know what i m sayin man what i ma tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man i m i m just in chicago i m trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts i m trying to get on and like there wasn t nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like i m just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain t have to deal with the landlord cause he s a jerk me and my mother drove to newark new jersey i hadn t even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooooooooooh two days later i m in baseline and i seen dame dame didn t know who i was and i was like yo what s up i m kanye you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats you know i ain t talkin shit i m like oh shit and all this time i m starstruck man i m still thinking bout you know i m picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching i m lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the can t be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i think ty ty john meneilly a bunch of people i didn t know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh i m killin y all niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so that s all the response he said man that was tight that was it you know i ain t get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at this time you know i didn t have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these a r s and they wanted beats from me so they d call me up i d play them some beats gimme a beat that sound like jay z you know they dick riders whatever so i ll play them these post blueprint beats or whatever and then i ll play my shit i ll be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i ain t have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didn t sign me you know what happened it was some a r s that fucked with me though but then like the heads it d be somebody at the company that ll say naw like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man i m not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up let s just say i didn t get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasn t even a nigga you know the person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure it s not wack then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the
