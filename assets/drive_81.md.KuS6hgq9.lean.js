mine is something that we look at differently how do you picture me huh want me to smile you want me to laugh you want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face when i m mad and put on a mask for real though i mean what you expect from me i m tryna do this respectfully they say that life is a race i knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually i do my best to be calm how you gon write me and tell me you d slaughter my family that s just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me these are the parts of my life they don t never see woo i am aware it s aggressive i am not here for acceptance i don t know what you expected but what you expect when you walk in a therapy session huh therapy therapy session therapy therapy session this girl at the show looked me in the face and told me her life s full of drama said her dad is abusive apparently he likes to beat on her mama i got so angry inside i wanted to tell her to give me his number but what you gon do with it right you gon hit him up then he ll start hittin her harder that s real these kids they come to my shows with tears in they eyes magine someone looking at you and sayin your music s the reason that they are alive sometimes i don t know how to handle it this type of life isn t glamorous this ain t an act for the cameras you see me walk on these stages but have no idea what i m dealing with after it nah i put it all in the open this is the way that i cope with all my emotion i m taking pictures with thousands of people but honestly i feel like nobody knows me i m tryin to deal with depression i m tryin to deal with the pressure how you gon tell me my music does not have a message when i m lookin out at this crowd full of people i know i affected agh i got some things in my life i know i should let em go let me jot it down let me take a mental note i put it all in this microphone think about that for a minute what is the point of this song i m just ventin but what you expect from a therapy session huh  therapy therapy session therapy therapy session what you think about me that doesn t worry me i know i handle some things immaturely i know that i need to grow in maturity i ain t gon walk on these stages in front of these people and act like i live my life perfectly that doesn t work for me christian is not the definition of what perfect means woo i ain t the type to be quiet i ain t gon sit here in silence if i wouldn t say what i say to your face then i promise you i wouldn t say it in private i am not lyin people go off on my page and i m tryin to quit the replyin but this is ridiculous i m passionate man i really mean what i m writing you want me to keep it a hundred okay i ll keep it a hundred i see a whole lot of talkin on socials but honestly i don t see nothing in public i kinda love it yeah why don t you write us some happy raps that would be awesome all of your music is moody and dark nate don t get me started you wanna know what it s like if you met me in person listen to my verses this music is not just for people who sit in the pews and pray at the churches nah i won t reject it i don t expect everyone to respect it i don t expect you to get my perspective but what you expect from a therapy session huh i mean i think sometimes people they confuse what i m doin i write about life i write about things that i m actually dealing with something that i m actually experiencing this is real for me like this is something that personally helps me as well i m not confused about who gave me the gift god gave me the gift and he gave me the ability to to do this and he also gave me this as an outlet and that s what music is for me when i feel something whether it s anger um it s a passion about something or frustration like this is where i go this is this is that s the whole nf real music thing man this is real for me i need this this is a therapy for me88","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"stop the train is riding down to the station

fancy don t let me down she said here s your one chance fancy don t let me down mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck then she kissed my cheek and then i saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak she looked at our pitiful shack and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath she said your pa s runned off and i m real sick and the baby s gonna starve to death she handed me a heart shaped locket that said to thine own self be true and i shivered as i watched a roach crawl across the toe of my high heeled shoe it sounded like somebody else that was talking asking mama what do i do she said just be nice to the gentlemen fancy they ll be nice to you she said here s your one chance fancy don t let me down here s your one chance fancy don t let me

built our houses on our hands we are confident in our own plans here we sleep and here we stand we are right now oh woah oh no one knows who we are oh woah oh no one gave us a mark oh woah oh no one

not ashamed we are right now oh woah oh no one knows who we are oh woah oh no one gave us a mark please i m all for looking hard at things that need to change but first the fiction has to be knocked out of the discussion let me set a few things straight first off this article is irrelevant and outdated perhaps if these journalists had written this twenty years ago when the truth was a little more ragged they could have made an argument that wasn t so laughable back when warehouses were being broken into fire codes were ignored dodgy generators were powering a massive sound system and restrooms were non existant this was a time that safety probably wasn t exactly job one things were smaller then though there weren t tens of thousands of people looking to gather in one place not like now this scene has grown and in response to the people it serves it has grown up today massive events are being held on terms that have been scrutinized by engineers civil servants fire chiefs policemen and all manner of bureaucratic safety hoops as edm s numbers have become larger we ve become more accountable no longer hiding in an abandoned warehouse we re paying taxes paying dues and stimulating the hell out of each cities economy that hosts an event before the doors ever open there is a string of green lights that have to be run through by people whose business it is to keep these events safe the same codes put into place for every other genre of music applies to edm to say otherwise is untruthful and adheres to dangerous stereotyping i wouldn t dare say we ignore the tragic accidents that happen i wouldn t dare say they don t happen but it takes a rudimentary understanding of the basic laws of probability to guess that the more people that show up to these festivals the larger the risk is that something goes awry this isn t unique to this music this is a universal principle can we hope to avoid it absolutely can we take every precaution and security measure to hedge the odds definitely but can the promoter be held responsible for the actions of the individuals at his events no he can not what it comes down to is this the responsibility to address substance abuse and addiction cannot come down to people who are event promoters not only is it unrealistic to expect them to tackle such a huge problem it s an enormous insult to those who have made it their life s work to do so clearly if the us government hasn t come up with the magic bullet to quell the problem of drugs in this country it is not reasonable to expect an event promoter to pull this kind of trick out of his hat either i am dug in so deep that articles like this one smacking of uninformed bigotry fire me up in a pretty passionate way to assign responsibility of regulating drug use to concert promoters is ludicrous in the extreme to paint a picture of a community of people as capricious and reckless drug users is irresponsible this is a conversation that has been going on for decades i don t expect it to end here but know this as far as a music culture goes edm is the one who will accept the kids on the outliers the ones who get bullied the ones who feel like they may not quite fit in this community is exceptional in its ability to bond all types together and i am not exaggerating when i say it saves lives our audience is intelligent and kind discriminating only in regards to which sound they like best our audience is unprecedented in their drive to proactively support each other there s your story la times do the world a favor and dig into that for a change punks

lights flashin in the hot new jersey night  meanwhile far away in another part of town rubin carter and a couple of friends are drivin around number one contender for the middleweight crown had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road just like the time before and the time before that in paterson that s just the way things go if you re black you might as well not show up on the street unless you want to draw the heat alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around he said i saw two men running out they looked like middleweights they jumped into a white car with out of state plates and miss patty valentine just nodded her head cop said wait a minute boys this one s not dead so they took him to the infirmary and though this man could hardly see they told him that he could identify the guilty men four in the morning and they haul rubin in they take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye says why did you bring him in here for he ain t the guy here s the story of the hurricane the man the authorities came to blame for something that he never done put in a prison cell but one time he could a been the champion of the world four months later the ghettos are in flame rubin s in south

jail be a nice fellow you ll be doing society a favor that son of a bitch is brave and gettin braver we want to put his ass in stir we want to pin this triple murder on him he ain t no gentleman jim rubin could take a man out with just one punch but he never did like to talk about it all that much it s my work he d say and i do it for pay and when it s over i d just as soon go on my way up to some paradise where the trout streams flow and the air is nice and ride a horse along a trail but then they took him to the jailhouse where they try to turn a man into a mouse all of rubin s cards were marked in advance the trial was a pig circus he never had a chance the judge made rubin s witnesses drunkards from the slums to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga no one doubted that he pulled the trigger and though they could not produce the gun the d a said he was the one who did the deed and the all white jury agreed rubin carter was falsely tried the crime was murder one guess who testified bello and bradley and they both baldly lied and the newspapers they all went along for the ride how can the life of such a

hated this one at first but it has grown on me a little bit on further listens yela s flow is super intense and it s giving me some rage against the machine vibes kind of like a southern zach de la rocha the instrumental itself is pretty nice with a chaotic sound coming out of it the weird robotic voice change at the end was kind of cool kinda thought the opening skit was kind of useless but oh well 7 10 track 2 change absolutely love the beat on here and yela s flow is so smooth and matches the beat great he sings the hook great and the backing vocals by the woman sounds pretty awesome added into the backdrop 3rd verse was pretty nice too with him ragging on the industry a bit the robot voice this time around sort of takes me out of the song a bit though 7 5 10 track 3 american you a great pre release song that holds up well on the album he really does have a great singing voice and this song showcases that talent extremely great this is a great hybrid with some minor rapping thrown in over a lot of dope singing especially in the third verse yelawolf pulled this off without trying to sound poppy or radio friendly 8 10 track 4 whiskey in a bottle another amazing song that i really fucked with when it was released before the album still sounds great and is pretty awesome in the continuity of the album the hook is absolutely amazing even the lalalalala part which i actually enjoy the beat has a droning feel to it which i think is awesome and his flow matches up great too 9 10 track 5 ball and chain interlude honestly usually when i see the words interlude i m expecing a cringe worth skit but instead yela gave us a short but sweet dope little singing piece that is actually pretty damn good 8 10 track 6 till it s gone my favorite pre release song as well as what i think is yela s best rap song to date the instrumental is a perfect mix of country guitar and etherial rap in the background wolf also has such an intense flow as well as nice makes this a super dope song 9 5 10 track 7 devil in my veins the best pure singing song on the project easily yela s vocals are really haunting and kind of give you a depressing feeling when he goes on and on not gonna lie i cried the other day listening to this don t know why exactly but i just felt something well up and then the tears started coming out doesn t usually happen so props to yelawolf for getting that reaction out of me the instrumental is also a awesome 10 10 track 8 best friend after a string of great songs this joint which should have been amazing got completely ruined by eminem em literally used the worst flow possible for this song plus some really cringeworthy to top it off he single handedly derailed the song i wish yelawolf would have taken this song solo or got big krit on it because yela had some amazing singing on the hook and nice verses sigh what could have been 6 10 track 9 empty bottles another absolutely amazing song with a great instrumental and what has now became typically amazing singing from wolf he has a great slower rapping style on this song and the best way to describe this joint is that it has a slower vibe that still manages to feel really sinister really dope shit 10 10 track 10 heartbreak i liked the piano beat which idk why but it sounded like a more interesting version of same love the instrumental does grow on you a lot as goes on and yela s rapping while subdued still sounds very great on this song the hook is one of the best on the album imo and it makes this song that much better this is one of those joints that will grown on you more and more 9 10 track 11 tennessee love yes this song has been around forever but it fits perfectly on this project it still sounds good and actually sounds even better once you have gotten used to the half singing half rapping that is all over this project a great vibing out song that has only improved its quality on my ears 8 5 10 track 12 box chevy v this would sound great on any of his trunk muzik tapes but this sound really out of place on this album the instrumental is decent but like i said it sounds strange to show up on this album this also isn t his best song from the box chevy series it sounds better in the second half when there is more guitars to get the more country feeling to it not a bad song but i wish he would have put it on a different project 7 10 track 13 love story another song on here that i didn t think was all that great at first but completely grew on me this might lowkey be one of his best rapping performances on this album he just keeps getting more and more intense as it goes and it sounds really well with piano that drones along this song went from one of my least favorites to one of my favorites 9 10 track 14 johnny cash the instrumental is just absolutely amazing here the angel sounding women in the background and the lone guitar mixed together really makes this some top notch shit this is another slow burn type of song it really does have slow pacing and rapping to it but i really love how well it sounds album highlight for sure 9 5 10 track 15 have a great flight another song that has some really dope and haunting vocals from yelawolf at this point i think it is safe to say that yela is the best rapper that also sings currently in the whole genre of hip hop no joke this guy has a pretty golden voice and it is great how he both sings and raps on his songs and it sounds naturally good 9 10 track 16 sky s the limit one of my favorite beats of the project is right here the piano is so laid back yet it still sounds energetic somehow once again yela switches his style between a dope sung hook and some intense rapping i think i never realized just how dope his voice sounded rapping until this song also the are pretty amazing with him flexing his political knowledge on here 9 10 track 17 disappear damn talk about a sad song somewhat reminded me of last good sleep as far as subject matter goes but that is a pretty weak comparison i have to give props to yela for putting something this personal on his album the instrumental has almost a lullaby tone to it and once the strings kick in i get sad as fuck 9 10 track 18 fiddle me this this was a pretty great way to end the album it would have left you depressed had it ended on disappear but this ends the whole thing on a victory lap sort of feel this is what i would imagine you would hear at a bonfire or a barn party or some shit in the south this made me bob my head something fierce the instrumental is awesome as well with that goddamn fiddle going hard 8 5 10 final verdict i initially thought that this was going to be a big let down after how long yelawolf waited to release it but in reality this went completely the other way than what i expected this album completely blew me away nearly all of the production was amazing and did a great job of mixing country and rap instrumentals together yelawolf himself felt hungry on this release and had lots of dope flows and to go all over this thing obviously i got praise yela for his singing which is the most amazing vocals i think i have ever heard from a rapper the biggest strength of this release is how seamlessly country rap and a little bit of rock have all been merged perfectly in this album there are still some cons to this project the first two songs are decent but the album doesn t really feel like it gets going till track 3 also box chevy v feels a little out of place as well as the eminem verse other than that this shit is golden this is for sure in my top 3 rap projects of the year 9 101","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"waterfalls is complete finished after two years of writing and recording we have gotten to the end point of this journey i conceptualized this

in the title track refers to how i feel when i listen to music whenever an artist such as bob seger or bruce springsteen hit a particular chord or wrote a particularly relatable lyric it created a connection of some sort it felt like a waterfall rushed over me that was the same sensation i hoped to make with these songs i wanted the cover art to show this emotion with a naked woman nudity is us at our most vulnerable and music has a way of protecting our vulnerabilities think about it when your favorite artist sings or raps and exposes their wrongdoings exposes themselves we feel safer

he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how another body laying cold in the gutter listen to me don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used

pray all ten fade away seldom praise him for the sunny days and like his promise is true only my faith can undo the many chances i blew to bring my life to anew clear blue and unconditional skies have dried the tears from my eyes no more lonely cries my only bleeding hope is for the folk who can t cope with such an endurin pain that it keeps em in the pourin rain who s to blame for tooting caine

dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to i know that you re gonna have it your way or nothing at all but i think you re moving too fast don t go chasing waterfalls please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you re used to i know that you re
