easy steps to create an enemy and start a war listen closely because we will all see this weapon used in our lives it can be used on a society of the most ignorant to the most highly educated we need to see these tactics as a weapon against humanity and not as truth this is how to create an enemy this is how to start a war this is how to create an enemy first step create the enemy sometimes this will be done for you second step be sure the enemy you have chosen is nothing like you find obvious differences like race language religion dietary habits fashion emphasize that their soldiers are not doing a job they are heartless murderers who enjoy killing third step once these differences are established continue to reinforce them with all disseminated information fourth step have the media broadcast only the ruling party s information this can be done through state run media remember in times of conflict all for profit media repeats the ruling party s information therefore all for profit media is state run fifth step show this enemy in actions that seem strange militant or different always portray the enemy as non human evil a killing machine this is how to create an enemy this is how to start a war this is how to create an enemy sixth step eliminate opposition to the ruling party create an us versus them mentality leave no room for opinions in between one that does not support all actions of the ruling party should be considered a traitor seventh step use nationalistic and or religious symbols and rhetoric to define all actions this can be achieved by slogans such as freedom loving people versus those who hate freedom this can also be achieved by the use of flags eighth step align all actions with the dominant deity it is very effective to use terms like it is god s will or god bless our nation ninth step design propaganda to show that your soldiers have feelings hopes families and loved ones make it clear that your soldiers are doing a duty they do not want or like to kill tenth step create and atmosphere of fear and instability then offer the ruling party as the only solutions to comfort the public s fears remembering the fear of the unknown is always the strongest fear this is how to create an enemy this is how to start a war this is how to create an enemy we are not countries we are not nations we are not religions we are not gods we are not weapons we are not ammunition we are not killers we will not be tools mother fuckers i will not die i will not kill i will not be your slave i will not fight your battle i will not die on your

might stain my face and the summer sun might burn me til i m blind but not to where i cannot see you walkin on the backroads by the rivers flowing gentle on my mind i dip my cup of soup back from a

island where the food tastes good and were all smiling where the sun rises early and goes down late theres a dj in the place and it sounds so great i want to feel free cause im hating this it should be just me not relationships not employment exams and a load of stress i want a deep blue ocean thats soaking wet i want time on my side and life to be mine a bounce in my step and a nice skyline under silk covers stay in bed till one instead of reciting essays and the words i m on i want to disconnect just for a week or two and go along with nature like the seasons do trying to improve my mood with material worth i want to sit back relax instead of fearing the worst i want to wake up for once feeling nice and refreshed instead of being vexed thinking life is a test i want to go away clean air and warm evenings my mind can unwind not try to form meaning i want to have no cares feel like a kid again living in a simpler vein those were the easy days i want to write poetry im happy about instead of screwing paper when im having my doubts a little me time a chance for reflection some hours are burned to pay my final collection i want to eat mandarins every day of the week and not calculate how much my weight has increased i want to make everything with him better again wake up without rain when the weather has changed i want a live band so this music can touch instead of getting paranoid were losing the love  i want to be more positive and not so negative realise what ive got stop with the pessimist life is what you make it take what you strive for lifes taught lessons that helped me to rise tall and when the night falls i plan to sleep easy dreaming soulscapes and jazz breaks on cd appreciate my scenery count all my blessings use energy creatively stop all the stressing look to the future envision bright horizons be comfortable in peace and sleep the night silent and when im rhyming be thankful for the poetry spoken free over pat ds cruising beats the musics holding me so close like love now beautiful like evenings when the sun s just touched down i hear the good sounds realise my life is great and step in harmony moving to a brighter

down my rifle at his breast but then then a soldier i they say he was different kindly too apart from all the rest a lover of the poor his wounds ill dressed he faced us like a man who knew a greater pain than blows or bullets ere the world began died he in vain ready present and him just smiling christ i felt my rifle shake his wounds all open and around his chair a pool of blood i swear his lips said fire before my rifle shot that cursed lead and i i was picked to kill a man like that james connolly a great crowd had gathered outside of kilmainham their heads all uncovered they knelt to the ground for inside that grim prison lay a brave irish soldier his life for his country about to lay down he went to his death like a true son of ireland the firing party he bravely did face then the order rang out present arms fire james connolly fell into a ready made grave  the black flag was hoisted the cruel deed was over gone was the man who loved ireland so well there was many a sad heart in dublin that morning when they murdered james connolly the irish rebel god s curse on you england you cruel hearted monster your deeds they would shame all the devils in hell there are no flowers blooming but the shamrock is growing on the grave of james connolly the irish rebel many years have gone by since the irish rebellion when the guns of britannia they loudly did speak and the bold i r a they stood shoulder to shoulder as the blood from their bodies flowed down sackville street the four courts at dublin the english bombarded the spirit of freedom they tried hard to quell but above all the din rose the cry no surrender twas the voice of james connolly the irish rebel","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"we liming bottles poppin and girls around girls around eh we drinkin here we go hey

i fear death awaits me here on this hot dusty street up on a housetop but still i can see there hides a man with a rifle it s pointed at me i might escape from the man with a rifle but there are others just like him that i cannot see back of each window the click of a gun die if i stay and my love for her won t let me run where is secora will my eyes see her then in a moment she runs from a door down the street up on your horse she is crying ride out of town it s a trap and they re waiting for you but if i ride out she must ride with me then in a moment i know that our chances are gone for a bullet is well on its way and it finds my secora she cries as she falls in my arms over and over her soft lips did say now we re together i won t let them take you away one little sigh her little lips tremble then it was over secora had drifted away tears dim my vision but plainly i see the ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for me i rise to meet him my one thought it beat him he deserves death and i swear that this ranger will die i beat his draw and i shot him shot him six times just as fast as the bullets could fly my gun is empty or more i would shoot him now there are others just like him that want me to die their bullets are coming my way how they hurt when they hit me the pain makes me fall to the ground gone is my strength just the will left to fight i hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of life if i must die let me find secora let me hold on to her hand for the few moments left blindly i search and it isn t in vain i touch the soft velvet hand and
