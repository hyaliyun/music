tell this shit like its supposed to be told cause i learned this game on harbor road and now the funk of the funkest so when it comes to shooting this gift bitch you know this so step with caution cause niggas like playing the role of the boss and big time players but are squares so niggas beware black c is taking you through these motions and im going deeper than a muthafuckin ocean so listen and take heed cause its the way of survival in the sfc back in my environment you see niggas bitches and queers whenever church chills at the pier see unitybut now in frisco its straight violence see you cant go across town and if you do dont let your guard down or better yet dont get caught slippin cause niggas my age is doing the peelin thats 18 with a gangsta lean i sell dope cause i never had dreams or admirations but best believe ill fuck your bitch in different ways and im just a knucklehead from the streets all i want is a mic and some of that funky ass beat with a bumpin bassline and my ticket out the game is to write this sick rhyme to the white man im an endangered species thats why they always wanna search and seize me but if they dont find nothin they always wanna put somethin

the test most niggas try to act real boldly and end it with as i die slowly ill have my jimmy on arrival its the only way of survival how you gon say what you dont know and lead where you dont go cant simp for any hoe and you gotta be real when you living in frisco thats what an hp og told me plus watch everyone that says theyre your homie and if you dont you might get your cap peeled cause all this turf shit got niggas actin ill and for that girl that you call that youre caring watch out cause she and a nigga might be sharing so kick back and let my knowledge hit ya cause if hate dont kill ya loves gonna getcha this shit is real so keep your ass out the game if you dont know the deal niggas keep slippin on their own high and now theyre living like tales from the crackside its problems

wondered if your heart might burst the sweater has that slightly goat like smell which all teenage boys possess and that smell will lovingly transfer to all your other clothes if you get to keep it

sweater back he forgot you put it on in the tent on saturday and he s been looking for it and you don t have to die of humiliation you know you are a strong person and this is a learning experience you can still hold your head up high as you run from the classroom tearing the stinking sweater from your body you look at that sweater carefully and you realize that love made you temporarily blind

pink chill refinery cloud light two big black birds flew over their wings whooshing and low two ravens but only two their black feathers tinted in the sunset i knew these birds were omens but of what i wasn t sure they were flying out toward the island where we hoped to move you were probably inside you were probably aching wanting not to die your body transformed i couldn t bear to look so i turned my head west like an early death now i can only see you on the fridge in lifeless pictures and in every dream i have at night and in every room i walk into like here where i sit the next october still seeing your eyes pleading and afraid full of love calling out from another place because you re not here i watched you die in this room then i gave your clothes away i m sorry i had to and now i ll move i will move with our daughter we will ride over water with your ghost underneath the boat what was you is now burnt bones and i cannot be at home i m running grief flailing the second time i went to haida gwaii was just me and our daughter only one month after you died my face was still contorted driving up and down boots wet inside aimless and weeping i needed to return to the place where we discovered that childless we could blanket ourselves in the moss there for our long lives but when we came home you were pregnant and then our life together was not long you had cancer and you were killed and i m left living like this crying on the logging roads with your ashes in a jar thinking about the things i ll tell you when you get back from wherever it is that you ve gone but then i remember death is real and i m still here in masset it s august 12th 2016 you ve been dead for one month and three days and we are sleeping in the forest there is sand still in the blankets from the beach where we released you from the jar when we wake up all the clothes that we left out are cold and damp just from the air permeating the ground opens up surrounded by growth nurse logs with layers of moss and life young cedars the sound of water thick salal and god like huckleberries the ground absorbs and remakes whatever falls nothing dies here but here is where i came

giving me a piece of mind and for most people to lose they mom they ll be out they mind though often times i would reminisce and wish that you were you here to guide through my trials and help me face

tackle when niggas ball on your block and they bust at you the field s full of players and they all trying to score the whole team sits on the bench in the down pour cause no matter the weather the game don t stop competing with other teams that reign on top your offense gotta be cats with no conscience no nonsense niggas with no options that know how to carry that rock make the hand off and run off the block it s hard to get first down when your new in this rough town you sell a pound its a touchdown and niggas see the pigskin they blast cops so federal agents dress as mascots niggas hold weight but it s not for lifting the only white lines is the ones niggas sniffing i know it sounds a bit different the only quarter is a quarter ki if that ain t a penalty it oughta be and the concession stand is so sick serving you the cat rat and dog on a stick but if you ask why somebody got slain yo it s just an unfriendly game the game don t stop cats keep playing some got hit hard and wound up laying out in the field but the fans keep paying understand what i m saying it s just an unfriendly game this ain t america is it this ain t america is it where can i be yo a yo it s monday night we on some watch the game shit but i can go outside and still see the same shit cause look there s a bunch of niggas in a huddle looks like they calling the play come on kids don t be all in the way cause that s pookie he the fucking quarterback cause he like to use the shotgun if he don t i know he got one and that s budda he the fucking running back cause he always say he gone quit and he always wind up running back the rest of them i ll just say they play the line cause they like to protect pookie and pookie make them stay in line and if they make a wrong move they penalized not by the referee but by pookie brother jeffery and jeff don t touch shit he sit and watch oversees the whole block from his own private luxury box he the one that makes the deals happen smoking big cigars while his stars are in the field scrapping but tonight the line of scrimmage got penetrated the block got raided and everybody got traded now they wearing stripes in a pen guess that s how the game go nigga you don t know highlights at 10  wednesday police arrested 12 men in a downtown drug raid the cartel known on the streets as the sharks was transporting large amounts of marijuana in shipments of little league football equipment there s a new team in from out of town what s the sound out of bounds and the front line niggas stay ready for the blitz sonny so you won t make a sack of money and every now and then somebody drops the ball and the next team be right there to take it all now somebody new is trying to make a score in your territory it s the same old story and if you want your corner back you better wear a vest just in case you gotta catch a bullet to the chest believe me that shit can be a humdinger cause every quarterback in this league s a gunslinger the half time show s kinda ill hood rat bitches dancing to dru hill another nigga down and out a crackhead with no name yo it s just an unfriendly game the game don t stop cats keep playing some got hit hard and wound up laying out in the field but the fans keep paying understand what i m saying it s just an unfriendly game this ain t america is it this ain t america is it where can i
