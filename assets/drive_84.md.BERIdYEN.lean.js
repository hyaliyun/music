my words but a whisper your deafness a shout i may make you feel but i can t make you think your sperm s in the gutter your love s in the sink so you ride yourselves over the fields and you make all your animal deals and your wise men don t know how it feels to be thick as a brick and the sand castle virtues are all swept away in the tidal destruction the moral melee the elastic retreat rings the close of play as the last wave uncovers the newfangled way but your new shoes are worn at the heels and your suntan does rapidly peel and your wise men don t know how it feels to be thick as a brick and the love that i feel is so far away i m a bad dream that i just had today and you shake your head and say it s a shame spin me back down the years and the days of my youth draw the lace and black curtains and shut out the whole truth spin me down the long ages let them sing the song see there a son is born and we pronounce him fit to fight there are black heads on his shoulders and he pees himself in the night we ll make a man of him put him to trade teach him to play monopoly and not to sing in the rain the poet and the painter casting shadows on the water as the sun plays on the infantry returning from the sea the do er and the thinker no allowance for the other as the failing light illuminates the mercenary s creed the home fire burning the kettle almost boiling but the master of the house is far away the horses stamping their warm breath clouding in the sharp and frosty morning of the day and the poet lifts his pen while the soldier sheaths his sword and the youngest of the family is moving with authority building castles by the sea he dares the tardy tide to wash them all aside the cattle quietly grazing at the grass down by the river where the swelling mountain water moves onward to the sea the builder of the castles renews the age old purpose and contemplates the milking girl whose offer is his need the young men of the household have all gone into service and are not to be expected for a year the innocent young master thoughts moving ever faster has formed the plan to change the man he seems and the poet sheaths his pen while the soldier lifts his sword and the oldest of the family is moving with authority coming from across the sea he challenges the son who puts him to the run what do you do when the old man s gone do you want to be him and your real self sings the song do you want to free him no one to help you get up steam and the whirlpool turns you way off beam later i ve come down from the upper class to mend your rotten ways my father was a man of power whom everyone obeyed so come on all you criminals i ve got to put you straight just like i did with my old man twenty years too late your bread and water s going cold your hair is too short and neat i ll judge you all and make damn sure that no one judges me you curl your toes in fun as you smile at everyone you meet the stares you re unaware that your doings aren t done and you laugh most ruthlessly as you tell us what not to be but how are we supposed to see where we should run i see you shuffle in the courtroom with your rings upon your fingers and your downy little sidies and your silver buckle shoes playing at the hard case you follow the example of the comic paper idol who lets you bend the rules so come on ye childhood heroes won t you rise up from the pages of your comic books your super crooks and show us all the way well make your will and testament won t you join your local government we ll have superman for president let robin save the day you put your bet on number one and it comes up every time the other kids have all backed down and they put you first in line and so you finally ask yourself just how big you are and take your place in a wiser world of bigger motor cars and you wonder who to call on so where the hell was biggles when you needed him last saturday and where were all the sportsmen who always pulled you though they re all resting down in cornwall writing up their memoirs for a paper back edition of the boy scout manual later see there a man born and we pronounce him fit for peace there s a load lifted from his shoulders with the discovery of his disease we ll take the child from him put it to the test teach it to be a wise man how to fool the rest quote we will be geared to the average rather than the exceptional god is an overwhelming responsibility we walked through the maternity ward and saw 218 babies wearing nylons it says here that cats are on the upgrade upgrade hipgrave oh mac later in the clear white circles of morning wonder i take my place with the lord of the hills and the blue eyed soldiers stand slightly discoloured sporting canvas frills with their jock straps pinching they slouch to attention while queueing for sarnies at the office canteen saying how s your granny and good old ernie he coughed up a tenner on a premium bond win the legends lie cradled in the seagull s call and all the promises they made are ground beneath the sadist s fall the poet and the wise man stand behind the gun and signal for the crack of dawn light the sun do you believe in the day do you believe in the day the dawn creation of the kings has begun soft venus brings the ageless one do you believe in the day do you believe in the day the fading hero has returned to the night and fully pregnant with the day wise men endorse the poet s sight do you believe in the day do you believe in the day let me tell you the tales of your life of your love and the cut of the knife the tireless oppression the wisdom instilled the desire to kill or be killed let me sing of the losers who lie in the street as the last bus goes by the pavements are empty the gutters run red while the fool toasts his god in the sky so come all ye young men who are building castles kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus mark the precise nature of your fear let me help you pick up your dead as the sins of the father are fed with the blood of the fools and the thoughts of the wise and from the pan under your bed let me make you a present of song as the wise man breaks wind and is gone while the fool with the hour glass is cooking his goose and the nursery rhyme winds along so come all ye young men who are building castles kindly state the time of the year and join your voices in a hellish chorus mark the precise nature of your fear see the summer lightning casts its bolts upon you and the hour of judgement draweth near would you be the fool stood in his suit of armour or the wiser man who rushes clear so come on ye childhood heroes won t your rise up from the pages of your comic books your super crooks and show us all the way well make your will and testament won t you join your local government we ll have superman for president let robin save the day so where the hell was biggles when you needed him last saturday and where were all the

natural almost lifelike the preacher spoke his mother cried when he said son you may now kiss the bride everyone cheered i thought how odd i didnt understand why with champagne and cake we celebrate the death of a single man so many flowers he was so loved prior to the bride as a matter of fact the maid of honor should be disqualified  to all his friends its a wake up call if it happened to him it can happen to us all nothing says its over man like a bad 80s cover band how can we dance to my sharona at the death of a single man he was so young so full of dreams before the day he fell now hes gone on to a better place or possibly to hell now here we are seems so unfair its poker night and theres one empty chair so many things were gonna miss his happy smile and that great laugh of his i think of him in the after wife life i guess all good things must end so with jack and coke well make a toast to the death of a single man1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"can t you find something else

jersey carmine corleone from the bronx and ah brooklyn philip tattaglia an from staten island we have with us victor strachi and all the other associates that came as far as from california and kansas city and all the other territories of the country thank you sitting down how did things ever get so far i don t know it was so unfortunate so unnecessary tattaglia lost a son and i lost a son we re quits and if tattaglia agrees then i m willing to let things go on the way they were before barzini we re all grateful to don corleone for calling this meeting we all know him as a man of his word a modest man he ll always listen to reason tattaglia yes don barzini he s too modest he had all the judges and politicians in his pocket he refused to share them vito corleone when when did i ever refuse an accommodation all of you know me here when did i ever refuse except one time and why because i believe this drug business is gonna destroy us in the years to come i mean it s not like gambling or liquor even women which is something that most people want nowadays and is ah forbidden to them by the pezzonovante of the church even the police departments that ve helped us in the past with gambling and other things are gonna refuse to help us when in comes to narcotics and i believed that then and i believe that now barzini times have changed it s not like the old days when we can do anything we want a refusal is not the act of a friend if don corleone had all the judges and the politicians in new york then he must share them or let us others use them he must let us draw the water from the well certainly he can present a bill for such services after all we are not communists zaluchi after some laughter from the group stands i also don t believe in drugs for years i paid my people extra so they wouldn t do that kind of business tattaglia whispers something to his aide zaluchi continues somebody comes to them and says i have powders if you put up three four thousand dollar investment we can make fifty thousand distributing so they can t resist i want to control it as a business to keep it respectable as he slams his hand on the table i don t want it near schools i don t want it sold to children that s an infamia in my city we would keep the traffic in the dark people the colored they re animals anyway so let them lose their souls vito corleone i hoped that we would come here and reason together and as a reasonable man i m willing to do whatever s necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems barzini then we are agreed the traffic in drugs will be permitted but controlled and don corleone will give up protection in the east and there will be the peace tattaglia but i must have strict assurance from corleone as time goes by and his position becomes stronger will he attempt any individual vendetta barzini look we are all reasonable men here we don t have to give assurances as if we were lawyers vito corleone holding up his hand to interrupt barzini you talk about vengeance is vengeance gonna bring your son back to you or my boy to me i forgo the vengeance of my son but i have selfish reasons my youngest son was forced to leave this country as he stands with tom s assistance because of this sollozzo business all right and i have to make arrangements to bring him back here safely cleared of all these false charges but i m a superstitious man and if some unlucky accident should befall him if he should get shot in the head by a police officer or if he should hang himself in his jail cell or if he s struck by a bolt of lightning then i m going to blame some of the people in this room and that i do not forgive then but that aside let me say that i swear on the souls of my grandchildren that i will not be the one to break the peace that we have made here today the don and tom move toward the head of the table where barzini is sitting tattaglia does the same the don and tattaglia embrace as the others applaud cut to the don s car driving night tom when i meet with the tattaglia people should i insist that all his drug middlemen have clean records vito corleone mention it don t insist barzini is a man who ll know that without being told tom you mean tattaglia vito corleone tattaglia s a pimp he never a could ve outfought santino but i didn t know until this day that it was barzini all along michael who has returned from sicily is walking and talking with the don in the don s garden vito corleone look at this tomatoes peppers all of this perfecto michael pop what about sonny then what about sicily vito corleone i swore that i would never break the peace michael but won t they take that as a sign of weakness vito corleone it is a sign of weakness michael well you gave your word that you wouldn t break the peace i didn t give mine you don t have to have any part i take all responsibility vito corleone well we have a lot of time to talk about it now kay to the children come on nancy keep together everyone blanche okay all right when kay notices michael standing beside his cadillac how long have you been back michael i ve been back a year longer than that i think then it s good to see

father that s what you told me michael my father s no different than any other powerful man after kay laughs any man who s responsible for other people like a senator or a president kay you know how naive you sound michael why kay senators and presidents don t have men killed michael oh who s being naive kay then kay my father s way of doing things is over it s finished even he knows that i mean in five years the corleone family is going to be completely legitimate trust me that s all i can tell you about my business then kay kay michael why did you come here why what do you want with me

up to her i said hello she said hey you re kind of cute i said yes i know but by the way sweetheart what s your name she said my friends like to call me exotic elaine i said my name is the prince and she said why i said well i don t know i m just a hell of a guy but enough about me yo let s talk about you and all the wonderful things that you and i can do i popped some trash and in a little bit of time i showed some cash and the girl was mine i took her over town i wined her and dined her she asked me did i like her i said well kinda all of a sudden she jumped out her seat snatched me up by my wrist and took me out to the street she started grabbin all over me kissin and huggin so i shoved her away i said you better stop buggin she got mad looked me dead in my face threw her hands in the air and yelled out rape i got scared when she started to yell so i handed her my wallet and ran like hell i was duckin through alleys right and left but when the cops caught up they almost beat me to death i was arrested charged with aggravated assault but it wasn t my fault nevertheless don t mean to bust your bubble but girls of the world ain t nothing but trouble so next time a girl gives you

music was soft and there was wine in the glasses she started winking and making little passes at me she grabbed me close and that s when she got bold she started feeling up my back i said oh your hands are cold we went into her bedroom thinking of one thing took the phone off the hook to avoid the annoying ring i carresed her body and i kissed her cheek and that s when i observed those satin bed sheets i felt that it was time for me to make my move i thought i better hurry up before i busted the groove i leaned down to kiss her but then out of the blue a door slammed and a voice said baby where are you her boyfriend busted in he grinned an evil grin and said boy i mma tear your butt limb from limb i was scared as hell where was i supposed to go i just yelled geronimo and jumped out the
