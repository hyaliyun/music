i heard the sound of horses and men at arms i felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds and when the forest did clear i was standing on a hill before me the armies of the worlds standing waiting i thought to myself for whom or for what are they waiting suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north there appeared a lone rider holding a sword of steel then from the south came another bearing a battle ax from the east came a third holding a spiked club and finally from the west a rider who wielded a great hammer of war with them came their soldiers of death followed by an army of immortals they were few in number but the look in their eyes told all who beheld them that they would leave this day only in victory or death and there was a great silence my heart began to pound storm clouds filled the sky with darkness rain came and the four winds blew with such anger that i held fast to a tree i watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air without warning screaming their war cry they led the attack down to the battle they rode they met the armies of the world with a mighty clash i could feel the ground shake the earth drank much blood that day each of the four was unto himself a whirlwind of doom when the smoke did clear many thousands were dead there was much blood and gore their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield like brown leaves blown by the wind and i saw the four ride together to the top of the hill while below them the soldiers of death assembled all those who would now swear allegiance to them and the four spoke the words of the warrior s prayer gods of war i call you my sword is by my side i seek a life of honor free from all false pride i will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail cover me with death if i should ever fail glory majesty unity hail hail hail and as i stood and looked on i heard the armies of the world hail them without end and their voices of victory carried long and far throughout the

stupid and in response they ve damaged your eye but there is where the conflict must end lest you both end up blind another song really sometimes the problems at play are not all plain to see so we lash out at our loved ones disregarding our bonds sanctity there are several sides to us that may seem abstract at first until we discover where everything fits and people can be like a half missing puzzle set as we find the pieces things make more and more sense nice imagery but i m not sure i follow well i ll give you an example i had this problem where i d often hide my less than awesome feelings so when i would feel like sobbing i d just smile and crack jokes i thought that that was coping only joking never showing sadness hoping it would go away did that work nope i felt bad  aw pat it s okay how s that everybody gets sad even dads that have people to care for and therefore you don t have to hide your pain life without rainy days is incomplete or like not even a thing you know rain goes to plants plants feed animals plant eating animals feed animal eating animals and humans feed animals corn and inject them with hormones until they can barely walk anymo patton yes how does all of that relate to rain oh right rainy days forgot what i was talking about um putting it simply rain is a necessary piece of the puzzle that is uh life so true are we done with singing or is this just one of those musical interludes on the subject of storm clouds cause you know you need storm clouds to make rain i m just gonna get into it you once knew me as real gloomy this weird spooky broody dude cause i knew you d listen to me as too scary to ignore i thought that i could take it all the hate could just be shaken but when you lo care for someone not much hurts more than their scorn i also felt bad oh come now in a different way different how by bad i mean well mean but i did what i thought i had to which is bad too i don t have to act all tough sometimes love is enough or what we need that was a quaint little review of things that we already knew now can our discourse resume there s pressing matters at hand actually that was for your benefit i don t see how that could be relevant logan please our goal s benelovent you know me i don t care for sentiment omg this serves as a testament to the fact that to me you re negligent which is fine it just works to your detriment you not letting me finish is proving my hey you re lost i m right here it s okay you re acting weird i was lost once too but thanks to all of you life sucks less now we re your best pals no one wants to be a joke but a life free of jokes is incomplete oh my gosh guys if we re airing out our dirty laundry would you mind if i participated by all means sure i d also like to contribute to this weird vent ey song please do i ve got an issue that feels like new school i don t wanna say i m too cool but i m just too fab for you fools and i feel like you don t get me you insulted us while venting sorry it s alright princey honestly it didn t hurt me it s clear that you re the one that s hurting huh you feel low that s not true it s okay don t assume you don t need to save face in almost any case we embrace you that s rich no one hates you everybody s got flaws but with no you at all i m incomplete there now you see everybody goes wrong and we put it in song so it s easier to hear it this puzzle s tough i ll admit but in time we ll find where everything fits3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"eyes in the sky gazing far into the night i raise my hand to the fire but it s no use

mare was tired and the fence line i was riding stretched forever my mind drifted off and back to carmella and her heart of black and the things that she d said to me yesterday so when the boss sent me out checking fences i was glad cause i knew that it meant that i could spend some time out all alone i wiped the sweat that stung my eyes looked up and i realized that i was coming up on the south windmill the concrete tank stood there beside the water trough that it supplied when the trough was full the mill could keep on pumping pumping pumping so we drank deep from the shallow trough and wetting my hair gave me the thought that a swim in that big tank might cool me down so i shucked my duds and hung em on the fence climbed the wires to reach the rim pulled myself on up and jumped right in the water was cool down underneath but deeper than i thought it d be there was no ladder and the walls were slick with moss sure enough i got cooled down when i found i had no way out and the thought of a rat in a feed bin chilled my blood well at first i laughed at the fix i was in then my troubles all sank in without some help i was there to stay i screamed and clawed to no avail till dignity and voice had failed i wore my fingers down on those damned walls i marked the time with the windmill s shade passing cross my mossy grave and the cows coming to water twice a day i always figured lightning strike or rattlesnake or barroom fight would do me in not some mexican rose the fact is i was hot and dumb struck stupid by the sun and love so on the one hand i guess she d played her part through all that time i cussed her lots but i cussed myself the most because i had not looked before i leapt now overhead an eagle soars and i smell rain coming from the north i wonder if she

federation city i have always been awed by them to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within our books our music our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests we ve taken care of everything the words you read the songs you sing the pictures that give pleasure to your eye it s one for all and all for one we work together common son never need to wonder how or why we are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill the hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our walls look around at this world we ve made equality our stock in trade come and join the brotherhood of man oh what a nice contented world let the banners be unfurled hold the red star proudly high in hand we are the priests of the temples of syrinx our great computers fill the hallowed halls we are the priests of the temples of syrinx all the gifts of life are held within our walls behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave i found it i brushed away the dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in my hands i had no idea what it might be but it was beautiful i learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn the keys to make them sound differently as i struck the wires with my other hand i produced my first harmonious sounds and soon my own music how different it could be from the music of the temples i can t wait to tell the priests about it  what can this strange device be when i touch it it gives forth a sound it s got wires that vibrate and give music what can this thing be that i found see how it sings like a sad heart and joyously screams out its pain sounds that build high like a mountain or notes that fall gently like rain i can t wait to share this new wonder the people will all see its light let them all make their own music the priests praise my name on this night in the sudden silence as i finished playing i looked up to a circle of grim expressionless faces father brown rose to his feet and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall instead of the grateful joy that i expected they were words of quiet rejection instead of praise sullen dismissal i watched in shock and horror as father brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet i know it s most unusual to come before you so but i ve found an ancient miracle i thought that you should know listen to my music and hear what it can do there s something here as strong as life i know that it will reach you yes we know it s nothing new it s just a waste of time we have no need for ancient ways the world is doing fine another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesn t fit the plan no i can t believe you re saying these things just can t be true our world could use this beauty just think what we might do listen to my music and hear what it can do there s something here that s as strong as life i know that it will reach you don t annoy us further oh we have our work to do just think about the average what use have they for you another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man forget about your silly whim it doesn t fit the plan i guess it was a dream but even now it all seems so vivid to me clearly yet i see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase i see still the incredible beauty of the sculptures cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world i was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as i saw a completely different way to life a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago i saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things i wandered home through silent streets and fell into a fitful sleep escape to realms beyond the night dream can t you show me the light i stand atop a spiral stair an oracle confronts me there he leads me on light years away through astral nights galactic days i see the works of gifted hands that grace this strange and wondrous land i see the hand of man arise with hungry mind and open eyes they left our planets long ago the elder race still learn and grow their power grows with purpose strong to claim the home where they belong home to tear the temples down home to change i have not left this cave for days now it has become my last refuge in my total despair i have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now i can no longer live under the control of the federation but there is no other place to go my last hope is that with my death i may pass into the world of my dream and know peace at last the sleep is still in my eyes the dream is still in my head i heave a sigh and sadly smile and lie awhile in bed i wish that it might come to pass not fade like all my dreams just think of what my life might be in a world like i have seen i don t think i can carry on carry on this cold and empty life oh no my spirits are low in the depths of despair my lifeblood spills over attention all planets of the solar federation attention all planets of the solar

your cowardice in facing down your flaws im not sure what makes me sadder all that talent up in flames or the lack of understanding that it wrought tossing off the baggage that is pulling down on me
