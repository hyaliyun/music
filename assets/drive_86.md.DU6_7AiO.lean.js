weary world was young the struggle of the ancients first began the gods of love and reason sought alone to rule the fate of man they battled through the ages but still neither force would yield the people were divided every soul a battlefield every soul a battlefield i bring truth and understanding i bring wit and wisdom fair precious gifts beyond compare we can build a world of wonder i can make you all aware i will find you food and shelter show you fire to keep you warm through the endless winter storm you can live in grace and comfort in the world that you transform the people were delighted coming forth to claim their prize they ran to build their cities and converse among the wise but one day the streets fell silent yet they knew not what was wrong the urge to build these fine things seemed not to be so strong the wise men were consulted and the bridge of death was crossed in quest of dionysus to find out what they had lost  i bring love to give you solace in the darkness of the night in the heart s eternal light you need only trust your feelings only love can steer you right i bring laughter i bring music i bring joy and i bring tears i will soothe your primal fears throw off those chains of reason and your prison disappears the cities were abandoned and the forests echoed song they danced and lived as brothers they knew love could not be wrong food and wine they had aplenty and they slept beneath the stars the people were contented and the gods watched from afar but the winter fell upon them and it caught them unprepared bringing wolves and cold starvation and the hearts of men despaired the universe divided as the heart and mind collided with the people left unguided for so many troubled years in a cloud of doubts and fears their world was torn asunder into hollow hemispheres some fought themselves some fought each other most just followed one another lost and aimless like their brothers for their hearts were so unclear and the truth could not appear their spirits were divided into blinded hemispheres some who did not fight brought tales of old to light my rocinante sailed by night on her final flight to the heart of cygnus fearsome force we set our course spiralled through that timeless space to this immortal place i have memory and awareness but i have no shape or form as a disembodied spirit i am dead and yet unborn i have passed into olympus as was told in tales of old to the city of immortals marble white and purest gold i see the gods in battle rage on high thunderbolts across the sky i cannot move i cannot hide i feel a silent scream begin inside then all at once the chaos ceased a stillness fell a sudden peace the warriors felt my silent cry and stayed their struggle mystified apollo was astonished dionysus thought me mad but they heard my story further and they wondered and were sad looking down from olympus on a world of doubt and fear its surface splintered into sorry hemispheres they sat a while in silence then they turned at last to me we will call you cygnus the god of balance you shall be we can walk our road together if our goals are all the same we can run alone and free if we pursue a different aim let the truth of love be lighted let the love of truth shine clear sensibility armed with sense and liberty with the heart and mind united in a single perfect

lying to you the words i promise seemed so trite so inaccurate sirens ended the charade and began the investigation seated on the cold end of a wooden table i shouted this is who i was but not who i

the past and she told me it was worth it because she told me it would last but darling i ll hold my tongue as i hold you tight cause forgetting what you think love means is my sleeping pill every night i remember when you woke up and screamed maybe our love is just laced with lsd cause darling i m high on life and you re just high on me and as i tried my best to read between the lines your lips shaped words i tried to interpret as lies only to see the devil hiding deep inside the details as lucifer found his way back into retail my dear he sold us a product we didn t want to buy but we weren t trying to be original we were just trying to survive the voices in my brain telling me it s all in my head and i will sleep with one eye open but i won t sleep until i m dead cause a fair assessment of a existence is an inconsistent realist vision of selfish antics reduced to survival of the fittest defined by our ability to avoid those carrying any sickness and these whispers in my head intensify to raspy screams asking when my skull will explode so they can breathe they know that no one has a voice when no one is listening and the violent riot of staying silent or quiet is torturous to those who need to hear something and that violence has its own sort of beauty and you are my beauty and you re my violent smile and you are my violent prayer and you re not my oxygen but i breathe your air cause these voices in my brain remind me of past mistakes the beauty i found of being able to say look what i went through i survived but is survival living or is survival just a placeholder for a vacant mind to cut off the threat to coincide with the soil while their blood boils cause my biggest fear was never facing death or even facing what happens after my biggest fear was never facing anything like that my biggest fear was waking up in that coffin with these voices chanting a chorus of remorse a forced abort from the course i had chosen and now i m laying here frozen with fear staring up at a splintering slab of wood paid for with my life savings buried beneath the earth that grew the weeds that poisoned my family s feet what if i woke up walked back home and it was like nothing had happened we left your room the way you left it we just scrubbed the bloodstains out of the carpet we just rubbed the mud remains out of your pockets we just dubbed the tough claims out of your sonnets we just evacuated your room and hoped you would too but your spirit haunted it too long so we boarded it up moved along and watched it become a guest room a place for the non permanent inhabitants to exist within this home we created to raise our kid that was my biggest fear finding out something like that would happen cause the memories that have come with this only cause everything else to hurt deep inside of this dismissed feeling i feel but sometimes you have to face the past and maybe i ve never faced death but if i were to walk away then what would i be these voices in my head what would they say and what would they see did i survive or am i cursed did i die or did i learn what if i woke up like nothing happened what if i never wake up my dear then what s my purpose what if i woke up like nothing happened and darling darling what if you woke up too 2","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"quick while she turns her back slip it in im in a meat pack plant

me down dreams i have go but still i try to hold it since you left my lifes been lord don t let this hold me cause it s things change in the blink of an eye but still we try to pause time so won t die

looking in that casket thinking my grandpas in that box and i m out here barely breathing now i m sinking thinking everyone around me is truly trying to deceive me i almost burned the bridge to the only dude i trust cause i jumped to conclusions before we ever discussed love was never on my side but naturally i didn t care it s me against the world cause any less would be unfair as i sit in this chair i hear the kick and snare i see into the light in the darkness of despair and it s dreams i have go but still i try to hold it since you left my lifes been lord don t let this hold me cause it s

restaurant business plus a piece of ambient music from justin but i haven t listened to it yet dropped some film off to be developed that i m hoping could be right for jesu sun kil moon album art i was planning on walking down to the marina when i overheard someone say the word creole with the power of suggestion i walked the opposite way down the port to brandon s where i had a bowl of gumbo the waitress working there saw my iced tea cup she said oh i work there i said really i ve never seen you there before she said i work from 6am to 10 30am and i said oh i don t even wake up until 11 on my way back i saw this crackhead looking guy walking his dog the dog s hind legs were supported by this little wheelchair type thing and he was wearing this tiny little diaper the guy was walking the dog pretty fast and it concerned me a little and i thought about saying something but the dog s face looked happy enough at some point the crackhead guy picked the dog up wheelchair and all and they gave each other a kiss i could tell that the only thing they had in the world was each other and it was really touching my mind jumped to that horrible scene in midnight express where the cat the pet who belongs to the prisoner played by john hurt was hung by prison guards then i looked down and i was in the sunny spot on the road and it felt really warm and i looked up and i saw my friend roger s old apartment he moved to portland years ago and got married he and i used to go fishing up at point reyes and bolinas or stinson beach we d bring fish back and i d clean the fish and katy would cook them up and his girlfriend would come over and the four of us would watch boxing matches or movies or whatever i thought of katy as i do several times a day then i went into a corner market and bought some oranges and yogurt and water i came back to more emails and i ll listen to justin s piece of music soon then i m gonna restring my nylon string guitar read a chapter in john conway s book and see caroline tonight for dinner beautiful you septemer 2 4 45 pm in my green chair listening to the kids on the playground i had the most beautiful day yesterday with caroline i went for a walk through the marina fisherman s wharf and for the very first time in 28 years of living in san francisco i swam in the san francisco bay the water is always too cold and the thought of swimming in it has never crossed my mind but i saw three people out there in bathing suits not wetsuits like you see all the time it was a rare sight so i walked through the sand at aquatic park and touched the water it felt almost lukewarm and i couldn t believe it i said fuck it and i stripped down to my underwear and started walking out into the water like that guy in coming home you know at the end caroline was smiling really big and she said you re really going out there when i got about knee deep into the water it wasn t as warm as i thought i kept inching my way out there a little at a time until a wave came and hit me in the balls once your balls are freezing that s all that matters the rest of your body can handle that same amount of cold so i dove in and went out to where my feet couldn t touch the bottom i swam around a little came back sat in the sun looking out at the boats with caroline and i warmed up a little i shook as much sand as i could out of my clothes and got dressed it felt so refreshing to go out into that water i came back to my apartment it was nice taking my clothes off and seeing some sand fall onto the floor a nice souvenir from a beautiful day caroline cooked dinner and i flipped through the new movies on on demand and i stumbled upon the stanford prison experiment i saw that an old cast member billy crudup was in it i hadn t seen him in anything for a while so we watched it i gotta say this was definitely one of his best but caroline and i were both pretty tense as we watched it the guy playing the cool hand luke style prison guard was enjoying himself a little too much but the tension finally eased when the movie ended on day 6 of what was set out to be a 14 day experiment and after that i stayed up pretty late booking hotels for my east coast tour next month some flights as well but today has been spent paying bills and trying to figure out an acoustic version of this is my first day and i m indian and i work at a gas station for a tour that starts in israel this month i leave on the 6th the chord changes are very weird in this song and it requires a lot of bar chords involving all six strings using my index finger which isn t easy considering how long this song is it s 4 58 pm i can still hear the kids on the playground i m meeting caroline tonight for dinner and the world and everything in it is a beautiful place september 2 9 34 pm just back from dinner with caroline and opened my mail it was a letter and a photo from an ex girlfriend who i haven t heard from in over a year she s days away from having a baby i thought of our time together back then and how far she s come i remember her desk was very close to where i m sitting now where she did her homework and was studying to be a child psychologist and i remember the summer when her mother passed there s never a summer that goes by that i don t think about that the times we spent in santa cruz hospitals in los gatos i wrote her back and told her how happy it made me feel to see the photo that i send her my love and that i ll be back in touch after i m home from my next tour at the end of the month when she s a mother caroline wants to watch cool hand luke tonight because i mentioned to her how the guard in the stanford prison experiment was using the same southern accent and lines that were used by the guard in cool hand luke starring paul newman she s never seen it and i haven t seen it for probably twenty years she just told me that she ordered it that it was released in 1967 and i didn t realize that before i was born that year so i ll be paying attention to the movie more than i ever have tonight knowing that detail september 3rd 8 32 pm just back from mexican food with caroline today was a lot of errands and we walked through the marina i picked up the photos for the jesu sun kil moon album art bumped into my friend melody on the street whose coffee shop has recently been closed and we talked for awhile on the corner right in front of the market where i ve been buying groceries for over a quarter of a century it s all boarded up with plywood now we talked about all of our many friends who have left the city due to all the new developments at the end of the conversation she said mark whatever you do please don t leave i said i m not going anywhere i got back to my apartment and i finally had a chance to listen to this ambient piece of music that justin sent me and it s beautiful i m gonna add vocals to it on saturday the day before i leave for israel i just went over the chords of this is my first day and i m indian again and it s still tricky but i m getting it an old sun kil moon song called you are my sun is gonna play on tv today a show called mistresses and caroline wants to watch it she s in bed the cat s on her lap and she just told me that it s on in a minute september 3rd 11 46pm we watched the tv show mistresses and the song played early and after it was over we changed it to dateline thursday murder mystery hosted by keith morrison on channel 3 the cat is sleeping on her lap and hey i m 48 and i m healthy and happy and both my mom and dad are still alive and i can see the bridge twinkling like gold out my window i look up and jimmy fallon s face is on tv and just like billy crudup or anna paquin or jason lee every time i see them on tv it reminds me of when i was 32

building yachts in the former parking lot for the pride and joy of the recently employed and you offer things like a chicken or a hymn are these pixels of a better picture whoever said you had the answer living by the ghost of the house of cancer someone scratched the floor as a bug blew in the door it was dim in soon how the barks could fill in room just the perfect dad and i wish we could pretend that tomorrow would be all that was waiting and it was immense and designs that will connect to the floating power of their offers and our please with your hands reached out but replies are

you resent to reply in kind oh how could we be so blind is there wonder half the world around you breaking colour flights and praise are not your eyes in and your smiles inside the walls of the house of cancer see the flowers wilt in the government they built and the hammers wail for the ship that hasn t sailed we will fall behind of that message over time is it written in your constitution should be stepping white ordinary that s light and we can watch them wonder what the deal is you go secretly throw some water on the leaves it s the best of the days not been wasting me either watching or the dancer for living laughing at the house of cancer call your best shots and that doctor s got a lot of ideas that make even children made to wait there s a line that forms and its really quite a

to the moon is there something out there for you to be thinking it s just a guess and not your answer the porch lights just out in the house of cancer and the christmas parade got starting late today and a smaller one than the one expected and the baby s crying and the mothers hands are full what has happened to the line down at the grocery the mayors alright and she used to strike at the day for all our cares and there s always so many prayers by the comments they bring you can hear them echo sing where the hell are those saints a goin watch him it s not a letter to be answered park it in the
