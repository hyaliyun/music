listen to that train it is full of milk the mother grabs the daughter by the sleeve pulls her down the beach on the shore the daughter finds a pebble the color of a wedding gown puts it in her mouth crookeds her teeth is no longer hungry i dream i am a prince or a knight in shining removable armor my loves last lover is a sword i keep falling on i think too much when i kiss if love did not exist i would be so goddamn sane my poems would be billboards suburbia would be enough i would not have to gut myself to find my spine crushed into powder and brushed on her cheekbones my hair would not be

like to have control of the spin cycle whats its like to know what the yarn knows of sweaters you know how to hold myself together and love i know it is not sexy to make out with someone who so constantly has their foot in their mouth but remember i am also the one who told you i want to feel you like the lifelines on the palms of jesus when the nails went through i want to make popcorn with you with the lid off yes thats sexy talk yes im freaky yes i heard the bartender say it is not holy water if it doesnt burn going down and you are hot enough to keep me sober on a saturday night on bourbon street i told her you have a heart of gold i am kneeling in your bloodstream panning for the only thing that has ever felt like home if this drives me crazy make sure the straightjacket comes

that have been lost in translation even when the meaning is embossed on something that redefines stop signs something that erases and redraws lines for all the times curiosity gets the better of us but until it gets the best we test the lines until it gets the best it s all stop signs now all that you are changes we love while you are gone i ll be waiting and then theres you and i wanna kiss you so bad that i d be willing to cut off my own head and just throw it towards you lips and you d be well within your rights to just swat it to the floor but i d redefine hardcore lying there at the tips of your toes because god knows i d be trying to figure out some way to roll towards them and maybe that s crossing the line maybe that s a little creepy did i mention that i like you if i knew you better than i do i would know creepy s not the way to go so how s this i wanna kiss you like a traffic jam i wanna move slow i wanna stop and go like i know at least i m moving towards you and there s no use weaving through the gridlock because every clock keeps poly ticking and tocking to tell me this time for all the amazing in between thats been seen and heard and each word that s passed between us like someone with somewhere to go and i know i hardly know you so lets go slow like a turtle with a purpose lets not miss a single minute because every 60 seconds that contained within it are the two hundred times i ve tried to coax each smile to bloom into a laugh and the exact science of math can t begin to calculate half the time it would take to make misery turn itself into a punch line one that was willing to mine past silver and gold just looking for something to tell you something that s never been told i wanna hold you like mine are the last arms in the world i want them curled around you like the red and white stripes on a barber pole and when i give you a lump of coal for christmas and tell you that in a million years it s gonna be a diamond and will you wait for me until then because that s when i ll be evolved enough to melt all the other brains of men on earth and maybe i ve got a shot if all that remains is two gazelles on a serengeti planes and me of course if you re willing to make sweet sweet love with animals i ll totally understand i m good like that i ll ban together with whatever vegetation is left living me three weeds and a rubber plant will spend thanksgiving saying how grateful we are that you re happy now all that you do helps me get through love if you re unsure i will show you i want you to feel like the banana peal under charlie chaplains shoe because it s you that brings the house of this heart down it s you that s the chamber of commerce in a town thats got nothing to offer but everything everyone can t find every where else under the sun i m done with all of the every that done thinking of where it is i m going i m figuring about where it is i m at and that has got to be beside the one who s stopped me from trying to calculate the sum total of someone as if this biological calculus has ever done anything for me other than the something that keeps me seeking to self providence that don t exist like a swat team sharp shooter with cataracts i ve missed the point more times than certain americans have been elected to the oval office which is always once too often and lets face it sometimes two too many but this time i m willing to pay interest on a penny for your thoughts mortgage my mind finance an expedition that will find me a better way to get to know you because i ve read through the short story of my life and found that your name stands out on the page your slightest look unlocks the tumblers on my rib cage and you can gage my sincerity when i lift my heart towards you and tell you in a million years it ll be less than dust the slightest gust will blow it away but you ll have to listen to wind chimes say that you still are worth waiting for don t tell me you re not beautiful you re the kind of beautiful that the blind would see if we could figure out some way to give them three seconds of sight when you tell me you re not gorgeous i want to pop out your left eye and show it to your right now all that you do helps me get through love if you re unsure i will show you all that you are changes me love while you are gone i ll be waiting you re worth crossing whatever distance it would take worth building bridges to make a connection because i ve been secretly stealing stop signs repainting traffic lines so i can only go one way because as far as i can tell dedication is the better part of foreplay and i admit it i m committed everything i ve done i ve did it to make you smile because it s been the largest part some long while since i ve had someone do that for me you feel like comedy after three years of being on the bandwagon of calamity and i can t be bothered with a tragedy without trying to get to know you i ve been through enough wretchedness to know that some flowers can still grow through the garbage and you make me want to take up gardening seeing sadness drain the spirit out of this history as if the worst is yet to come those that took the time to know me know i don t run partly because i m not athletic but mostly because that s life and i ve met it head on i ve gone the distance more times than george lucas looked at jarjar binks and thought fuck and until i

thought heaven would be specific to each person and that each person would have their own version of it then asked me what mine would be i was so scared to tell you i don t have one but you nodded your head as if confirming a suspicion that school had robbed me of a belief in some stories you said you don t have to beleive what i believe its enough to be good be good i will i will think about your heaven your heaven would be the same haircut forever it would be a stick a dog and some distance a lawn that always needs mowing a six pack of pilsner short bottles and your real teeth back

everything with your hands i remember the difficult days i remember the bandages they looked like tiny blankets as if your knuckles had all gone off to bed walls that looked like they d said something to get under your skin and where suddenly made to pay for it i know you were an angry man finger tips like spent shotgun shells bleeding smoke cocktails of gunpowder and singed plastic you had what some people would call a temper but you loved a good joke even if it was on you something that would crack open the walls of your chest and let the wind tickle your heart just enough to let you know it was still there you didn t always laugh didn t always smile you did keep a mental ledger of what you called your send flowers list i remember thinking it was a thank you to those who got you good but learned the truth after my grandmother added a thin layer of sand to your sandwiches because you refused to make your own lunch for work you told me about it when you picked me up from school that day you said grandma just made the send flowers list and i asked because you love her so much and you said because i m gonna kill her of course you didn t your version of kill meant two months before winter having a seamstress take in each of her coats a few inches so on the first day she need one she fumbled with the sudden tightness and you stood there smiling then said honey i love you no matter how big you get she did not laugh and managed to staple your smile back into a straight face when she told all of your friends at work that you had to move into the spare room because you couldn t stop farting at night you often asked me if i had a heaven what would it be like and i told you that for such a small word if is just too big to wrap my belief around i would not bend to the hypothetical but wish now that i would ve even if it was just to ease your mind in the belief that i could be headed to that other place you believed in i would tell you now how my heaven is here it was here in the gentle warfare of your relationship with grandma where volleys were traded back and forth like hockey cards between children who didn t care what the stats meant my heaven would have been someone in grade five finally willing to trade me their fruit roll up for my tin of sardines my hell was wondering why why would you give me sardines for lunch my heaven would make you laugh cause i get the feeling you didn t get to do that very much through my hell through the night terrors and bloody noses through the eyes black bruised back sneak attack nap sack and winter coat hijacks you did your best to seal up the cracks in my armour and made my heaven here i would have loved to have made you laugh more to make your send flowers list just once so i offer you now my if if there

a time you and all your kind lived underneath bridges had ridges for ribs that dropped off into empty chests as if your hearts were all stolen treasures as if an excavation crew were hired to dig up and remove the part of you that let you feel and while the world above you invented the wheel you stayed put knowing it would one day need to roll over top of you to get to where it s going you had an endlessly flowing supply line of food you began to brood over humanity and made meals of our hope as if crushing our spirits would make your mirrors cast better reflections than the ones they gave as if the only way you could save yourselves was to make the world ugly so no one would notice you hiding in it you learned to knit pain into a kind of camouflage treated hope like a mirage that you could use to lure in your next meal you lived off of our fears as if you could taste what we feel and every night as the moon read bedtime stories to sunlight you took darkness as an invite to head out into the world you curled your hands into wrecking balls your breath became squalls you made rocks rumble you made land shiver you made boys and girls pray that someone would deliver them from you we told them you aren t real then one day the world changed but you all stayed the same just migrated from living underneath bridges to living underneath information super highways days and nights became meaningless each already deepened chest became an abyss that no one would ever find the bottom of concepts like love fell into your gravity we turned ourselves into live preservers hoping to save as many as we could but the fathers who stood guarding closet doors and the mothers who secured the floors underneath beds all shook their heads not knowing how to deal with you you who crept into our lives with tongues like knives stabbing your words into our skin you began to begin uploading yourselves into our homes you had computer screens for eyes and software for bones you turned your hate into stones and hurled them at beauty as if you couldn t bear to see anything other than ugly anything different you had fingernails like flint and scraped them along decency hoping we would be the ones to all catch fire you all had smiles like one way barbed wire not meant to keep us out meant to keep us in voice like a firing pin you spoke in explosions it isn t cute it isn t funny you ve talked strangers into death and laughed and as each family learns to graft skin over the wounds you gave them you hem yourselves into the scar you have coaxed the sober back into bars handed out cigars at memorials offered nooses cliffs and pills to those who unfortunately found you before they found help you have praised suffering waltzed in between tragedies gracefully dipping misery as if we would somehow be impressed with the dexterity of your animosity you have cheered on rape dashed through police tape as if it were the finish line in a race of who can be awful first even now you somehow see this as an invitation to turn your keyboards into catapults wondering which of you can be the first to hate this best your loathing already dressed in riot gear ready to incite rage as if each message board is a stage where you recite hostility turning freedom of speech into freedom of cruelty we are stuck with you the same way you are stuck with you your mind is glue and it keeps malice fastened there like cheap wallpaper we were once upon a time told that none of you exist we dismissed you as make believe or myth now armed only with resolve we can no longer afford to tell ourselves that you aren t real we will not let you make your dinners out of the things we feel 12","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"your entire body shakes when you laugh as if your sense of humor was built on a fault line and the coast of your heart falls into the ocean of yourself and i m left looking for atlantis left looking for this place that exists in the stories told by old men who were there when mathematics assured them their willingness to believe was greater than their determination to dismiss i m left looking for atlantis regardless of the scientist that insists my efforts would be better spent unearthing clues to where the wild things went try as it might faith can t put a dent in fact so we must settle for watching science re enact the world as if the universe was curled around this globe and if we consider that the universe is never ending then we re not even a microbe we re like a death threat from a pacifist we re nothing but the heisenberg uncertainty principle states that nothing is fo shizzle and the interesting thing about that is that it ensures that the principle itself can t even be a fact but we still act as if this time can see the forest through the trees regardless of the soft wood lumber levies we fall in line like reforested pine it s all straight rows where everything grows a little less wild a little more humdrum ho hum we come from the mentality that rarely sees the horror in symmetry or the beauty in non conformity we insist that for us everything must be clear cut but what about philosophy what about the tree that fell in the forest that no one was around to hear it s a little less clear a little more deep deep like if oprah winfrey farts in a bathtub and no bubbles come to the surface is there an alternate universe where the price of gas is cheap possible but we can t prove it any more than we can prove that light can move fast enough to stop a monster hiding in the closet we deposit our faith in fear but clear our minds to the possibility that maybe we as adults secretly sometimes still get scared of the dark things that go bump in the night and i can t prove that i ve ever loved anyone but despite the smoking and the overweight body i want to grow old with you go through muscle and joint pains to the point that every time it rains we can feel it in our knees get arthritis so bad that every time we move we sound like two bowls of rice krispies we re all snap crackle and pop but we still take the time to stop and take the time i m looking for atlantis letting faith turn this fiction into fact as if i tracked this missing continent for decades and all i know so far is that it is somewhere under water i m looking for clues in the most blurry photos of ufos and thinking if alien are so smart then why don t they start making their spaceships look like airplanes that way we d just point to the sky and say an airplane how common place and not at all suspect we re all shipwrecked on this idea that everything has to be explained but maybe we just need to believe that lemmings jump off cliffs to prove that they love us and sure that sacrifice is as empty as the box of condoms that politicians used when they thought they could fuck us but it is nice to believe that somebody up there cares enough to plummet onto jagged back breaking rocks in an attempt to tells us we re beautiful tell us that as far as life goes our fingerprints are like snowflakes we leave them on everything but they melt in the time it takes to touch someone s tongue but if we re lucky maybe we re remembered along with the sunken cities of a lost continent this is for each child who is a monument to the one s who came before maybe the best we can hope for is that those we leave behind find comfort in knowing that we re born out of love and not science that biology explains the how but love explains the why so in the event of our deaths we hereby bequeath all of these words to you and they are only meant to say that uncertainty is something everyone goes through and there is not much in the way of proof but believe me we loved you we held our breaths for your first step your first word we laughed when it finally occurred to you lemons are sour this is for every time love becomes the finest minute and the darkest hour this if for those who scour the streets wondering where the wild things went for the believers who leant us their madness this is for everyone we miss and this is for the children who were lost sadness is nothing more than the cost of being able to smile once in awhile and grief is the trial we stand to offer evidence that your fingerprints were left on our hearts and our skin and in terms of proof love can be demonstrated in giving our lives consist of the efforts we give in

comes wed wander the desolate planet hide in deserted city slums my dog would warn me hed bark if mutant cannibals were attacking us wed be bushwhacking and double backing in case those mutants were tracking us then wed finally find refuge in an abandoned nursery school and wed be alone id light a small fire and my dog would find and chew an unknown mystery bone wed wake up in the morning starving our lips blue and our ribs showing through and id spy a pack of wild dog puppies and think of trapping just one or two then my dog would look up at me with those big eyes all sad and gentle
