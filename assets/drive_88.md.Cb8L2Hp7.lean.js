different idea i was like a child i was light as straw when my father lifted me up there took me to a place where they checked my body my soul was floating in thin air i clung to the bed and i clung to the past and i clung to the welcome darkness but at the end of the night there s a green green light it s the quiet before the madness there was a girl that sang like the chime of a bell and she put out her arm and she touched me when i was in hell when i was in hell someone sang a song and i sang along cause i knew the words from my childhood intellect ambition they fell away they locked me up for my own good but i didn t mind cause the silence was kind and you spoke to me in whispers there was the sound of the wind in the cold cold dawn and the quiet hum of business  let me dangle a while in this waiting room i don t need to go i don t need to know what you re doing know what you re doing lying on my side you were half awake and your face was tired and crumpled if i had a camera i d snap you now cause there s beauty in every stumble we are out of practice we re out of sight on the edge of nobody s empire if we live by books and we live by hope does that make us targets for gunfire now i look at you you re a mother of two you re a quiet revolution marching with the crowd singing dirty and loud for the people s emancipation did i do ok did i pave the way was i strong when

body to body we sweating like the middle of the summer shit i think i might love her and the butterflies they don t lie but you sure do girl that s why i m internally conflicted deep inside looking for the right one always coming up dry so i ask myself why are the girls that i fight with the same ones that i seem to fuck with the most emotions are drained the passion the pain ain t got any more

can t seem to express how that put a pit in my stomach when i gave you my trust holding it down i m saying why are the girls that i fight with the same ones that i seem to fuck with the most emotions are drained the passion the pain ain t got any more love to devote i wish we could travel the world london to spain dubai i heard dublin is dope you push me away then you pull me in close you love me you hate me i just wanna know i just wanna know how could you do me like that i just wanna know i thought you knew me better i just wanna know than to do me like that like that like that cause you

hungry too and everyone was wondering what was the next thing he would do and the preacher he kept preaching he said now i ll remind you if i may you all better pay attention or i might decide to preach all day and now everyone was getting so hungry and the old ones started feeling ill and the weak ones started passing out and the young ones they could not sit still and the preacher s voice rose higher i snuck up to the balcony and i crept into the choir and i begged them brothers sisters help me please  i said when i give you a signal i said when i raise up my hands won t you please join with me together and praise the lord i have a plan and the preacher he kept preaching long is the struggle hard the fight and i prayed father please forgive me and then i stood up and with all my might i sang to the lord let praises be it s time for dinner now let s go eat we ve got some beans and some good cornbread and i listened to what the preacher said now it s to the lord let praises be it s time for dinner now let s go eat yes and i did give a signal yes and i raised up my hands and then joined with me the choir yes and every woman child and man they sang to the lord let praises be

knew a nigga whose real name was william his primary concern was makin a million bein the illest hustler that the world ever seen he used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams a corrupted young mind at the age of 13 nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend she put the pipe down but for every year she was sober her son s heart simultaneously grew colder he started hangin out sellin bags in the projects checkin the young chicks lookin for hit and run prospects he was fascinated by material objects but he understood money never bought respect he built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal but got locked once and didn t hesitate to squeal so criminals he chilled with didn t think he was real you see me and niggas like this have never been equal i don t project my insecurities on other people he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil a feeble minded young man with infinite potential the product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed dancin with the devil smoked until his eyes would bleed but he was sick of sellin trees and gave in to his greed everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance but then again there s always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but that s what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be god s angels that fell from the top there s no diversity because we re burnin in the melting pot so billy started robbin niggas anything he could do to get his respect back in the eyes of his crew startin fights over little shit up on the block stepped up to sellin mothers and brothers the crack rock workin overtime for makin money for the crack spot hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine fulfillin the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain tired of the block niggas treatin him the same he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs but when he tried to step to em niggas showed him no love they told him any motherfuckin coward can sell drugs any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood even puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club but only a real thug can stab someone til they die standin in front of them starin straight into their eyes billy realized that these men were well guarded and they wanted to test him before business started suggested rapin a bitch to prove he was cold hearted so now he had a choice between goin back to his life or makin money with made men up in the cyph his dreams about cars and ice made him agree a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three  everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences you probably only did a month for minor offenses ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance but then again there s always the wicked that knew in advance dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block but that s what happens when you rape murder and sell rock devils used to be god s angels that fell from the top there s no diversity because we re burnin in the melting pot they drove around the projects slow while it was rainin smokin blunts drinkin and jokin for entertainment until they saw a woman on the street walkin alone three in the mornin comin back from work on her way home and so they quietly got out the car and followed her walkin through the projects the darkness swallowed her they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw so billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground screamin shut the fuck up and stop movin around the shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed so billy stomped on the bitch until he d broken her jaw the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin blood leakin through the cloth she cried silently and then they all proceeded to rape her violently billy was made to go first but each of them took a turn rippin her up and chokin her until her throat burned her broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren t concerned when they were done and she was lyin bloody broken and bruised one of them niggas pulled out a brand new 22 they told him that she was a witness of what she d gone through and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew he thought about it for a minute she was practically dead and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head i m fallin and i can t turn back i m fallin and i can t turn back right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice and he felt strong standin along with his new brothers cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter cause he was starin into the eyes of his own mother she looked back at him and cried cause he had forsaken her she cried more painfully than when they were rapin her his whole world stopped he couldn t even contemplate his corruption had successfully changed his fate and he remembered how his mom used to come home late workin hard for nothin because now what was he worth he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth and cryin out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared but only the devil responded cause god wasn t there and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul they say death takes you to a better place but i doubt it after that they killed his mother and never spoke about it and listen cause the story that i m tellin is true cause i was there with billy jacobs and i raped his mom too and now the devil follows me everywhere that i go in fact i m sure he s standin among one of you at my shows and every street cypher listenin to little thugs flow he could be standin right next to you and you wouldn t know the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked white brown yellow and black color is not restricted you have a self destructive destiny when you re inflicted and you ll be one of god s children that fell from the top there s no diversity because we re burnin

give her something to believe cause now and then she ll get to worrying just because you haven t spoken for so long and though you may not have done anything will that be a consolation when she s gone

you somewhat incapable of a first impression what i do is i channel my aggression with no cable or antenna just intentions to impress you if capable hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you cars nothing i drive can drive you out of this frame of mind with such an ugly picture in it and money nothing i buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it diamonds a girl s best friend is what they say but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gon shine anyways and every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary the day before is better than the present so anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences no key for release no reason to be around her minds in the clouds she writes it all down in her diary i wonder why i sit and cry wish i could shed all these tears im down and out i ll keep on moving and tryna get out i don t know how to move on where i went wrong i wish i could live with no fear
