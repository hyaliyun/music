the music came far from the magic pink seashells and nobody talked but neptune had vanished when they lifted their eyes so they walked from the cave as two kingfishers cried in the bright shiny sunlight they got down on one knee they listened to the sea shells of the musical sea but the day grew much darker so they climbed on the breeze and they floated to the village and the people were pleased to see them so happy with their tinkling bells and the people all listened to the musical shells but the children were so sad the time had come to leave so the people waved goodbye and begged them to believe of the wonders they had seen in the island of the sky and the children said they would and away they did fly through the white clouds of no time til forever it seems and the children stayed children and they lived in their dreams1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i killed a man at midnight now the hunter s on my trail and if they even catch me no one is gonna pay my bill cause i

a canton ohio mall with friends one warm summer weekend jimmy page stood tall and screamed and i was mesmerized by everything the peter grant and john paul jones dream sequence scenes the close up of the mahogany double neck sg and though i loved the sound of the roaring les paul what spoke to me most was rain song and bron yr aur and i loved the thunder of john bonham s drums but even more i liked no quarter s low fender rhodes hum i don t know what happened or what anyone did but from my earliest memories i was a very melancholic kid when anything close to me at all in the world died to my heart forever it would be tied like when my friend was thrown from his moped when some kind of a big truck back ended him and when the girl who sat in front of me in remedial was killed in an accident one weekend and quickly forgotten about at school and when we got the call that my grandmother passed the nervous tension i d been feeling for months broke and strangely i laughed then i went to my bedroom and i laid down and in my tears and in the heaviness of everything i drowned though i kept to myself and for the most part was pretty coy i once got baited into clocking some undeserving boy out on the elementary school playground i threw a punch that caught him off guard and knocked him down and when i walked away the kids were cheering and though i grinned deep inside i was hurting but not nearly as much as i d hurt him he stood up his glasses broken and his face was red and i was never a schoolyard bully it was only one incident and it has always eaten at me i was never a young schoolyard bully and wherever you are that poor kidi m so sorry  and when i grew older i learned to play guitar while everyone else was throwing around a football wearing bright colorsthe school issued them parroting passed down phrases and cheerleading i got a recording contract in 1992 from there my name my band and my audience grew and since that time so much has happened to me but i ve discovered i cannot shake melancholy for 46 years now i cannot break the spell i ll carry it throughout my life and probably carry it to hell i ll go to my grave with my melancholy and my ghost will echo my sentiments for all eternity and now when i watch the song remains the same the same things speak to me that spoke to me then except now the scenes with peter grant and john bonham are different when i think about the deaths that fell upon them i got a friend who lives in the desert outside santa fe and i m going to visit him this saturday between my travels and his divorces and our time not being what it was it s been fifteen years since i last saw him he s the man who signed me back in 92 and i m going to go there and tell him face to face thank you for discovering my talent so

edge of our steps and our couches when just the hidden songs are left on our cassettes and our albums can we expect that something better surrounds us when we exit our houses the death of my childhood would unfold in notches it was a cave in social comet of a stolen promise so how d we grow up but not grow up into who we said we d grow up into we said we knew some day we d grow up beyond this now i m as lonely as the town drunk who only knows he s a man when he s holding a handful of soco and daniels sitting at the bar calling all the colleges girls over to sing him billy joel karaoke from a broken piano i don t wanna end up just like him i ll keep on writing till me bookmark bends i keep on writing till i lose all that s left of my good hard friends until i ve spent all the gold that had took our breathe if only it matters i probably i take the loneliest stance i miss unholy abandoned home to me we always will carry it with the strength of an ocean it ll grow like soldiers in battle and looking back over my shoulder see the roads that we travel without the worst nights and my glory years without the holes in the rooftop we climbed on without the dead nights and the adventure life without the memories we never bet our lives on how would i know whoever i am without the long drive to anywhere that we were always miles from if these are the best of times i don t want mine back the glory years i always thought i d have are here so for anybody who still feels they have the best years of their life left to live i m right there with you we nicknamed our best friend ghost for all the haunts he d have there s more to life then the glory years that we thought we d have we formed a pact for down the road in case we lost track a dollar diner coffee calls and screen porch menthol packs if you went up summer in an office selling car glass and i still live at home in five years lets get our maps and tape em to the window seat we could travel north fast small town kids who learned to fight from our divorced dads know the rules of separation like our palms tired eyed of watching burning houses from our lawns if only we could find a wait and vacant distant summers and fall in deep enough love we d make our parents miss each other one story starts for everyone that never made it i kissed my first girlfriend on an air mattress that levitated i used to hate the ground thats roots and holes are bound to fail but making out in ufos at the orange county fair made me feel like something from another world would save us or some great tragedy would come along to turn my pages maybe i was waiting for a battlefield to earn my place in still looking back at us the world can see we were courageous but all our worry signs and torn up lives i won t ignore fell in love too many times at least we got to know our floors i don t plan to ever get the moments we were hoping for a couple years later fast forward  now i know i won t try i know i won t try i will spend my whole life looking for an answer that i won t find now i know i won t find it damn right i won t find it imma take potential and bury it like i m gold mining i ll take my pen and i ll press it and pray my penmanship resurrects my depressions my friendships my i m in my own crisis because i m only twenty two how am i wishing for the wisdom that s been missing in collision with my old life i said i m only twenty two how the fuck am i wishing for what s missing in an old life without the worst nights and my glory years without the lows in the rooftops we dived from without the dead nights and the adventure life without the people that you never could rely on man how would you know whoever you are without the long drives down the black midnight roads we almost died on these are the best of times and i don t want mine back the glory years i always swore i d have aren t here but i got wrongs i got roads i got seams i got long intermissions where i lost my feet i got my best friends behind yeah i brought my team their in the background singing yeah that s all i need the orange lights the ocean gasp and it s all a passive my life flashes short enough to make my story last there s more to write then the pouring rain and the autumn grass there s more to drive to then all the places you wanna crash there s more to life then the glory years that you thought you d have but i don t know

stung huh i m on lonely street age nearly three recently mama s cryin all the time is it because of me or my younger sister even dad was weepin when he kissed her face all puffy like a blister cryin like he missed her since we moved away from the house where we used to play they say i ll understand one day but i doubt it mama never say nothin about it how d it get to be so crowded i found it a strain everywhere i look i see pain and i can t escape the feelin maybe i m to blame so i strain to listen prayin for a decision wishin they were kissin this feels like extradition or exile mama finds it hard to smile so i make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style she says child i m workin so there s nothin you lack but she know i want my dad i want my family back i m on lonely street age 43 couldn t gauge when to quit so my wife quit me took offense took the kids i wish that was the end but before she took her leave she took care of my best friend workin all the hours god send was not the tactic you see cause after ten years i m left with jackdish wanted to make the cash quick so i had to work real late bad sex my woman s vex even if i stay awake and if i m honest i had a lickle cake at the office i was eatin we d do our cheating over coffees makin tea for the bosses makin free with me and i agree i got sleazy too easily but i m 43 this doesn t usually happen to me now i m lonely i m wonderin what my son s doin today suddenly i m blinkin like the screen on my computer display and i m drinkin concerned about what s down the track if i don t get my family back i want my family back yeah mm i want my family back huh i m on lonely street number 53 boarded up properly i ll probably get pulled down litter all around inside there s no sound and no light but yo it gets busy at night people creepin derelicts sneakin into fix speakin on the way my timbers creakin roof leakin and bricks comin loose knee high in refuse but even though i m a slum i m still of some use huh there was a time when my walls were decorated and under my roof children were educated but now paint s faded windows are all smashed a crash in the economy robbed me of my family and no strategy combats negative equity so that s it like violence it s drastic i m freakin and seekin to be more than just a house for crack somebody bring my family back1","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i m sittin at

next i m mad vex the way she gently scratches his chest you used to do that to me back in 1253 pity me while you lie with your lover i stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair unaware of

let s take a ride tonight while the highway s got nobody in sight we ll pull off to the side if we get tired and we ll try to get fed or we ll try to get hired i ve got no desire to run on forever with a romanced hobo heart that tarries but i m going to take this slot machine by the lever and hope that we pull down three big cherries i ve walked the spanish steps across the streets of rome we

believe in any form of discrimination or segregation i believe in islam i m a muslim and there s nothing wrong with being a being a muslim nothing wrong with the religion of islam it just teaches us to believe in allah as the god and those of you who are christians probably believe in the same god because i think you believe in the god that created the universe and that s the one we believe in the one who created the universe the only difference being you call him god and i we call him allah jews call him jehovah if you can if you understand hebrew you probably call him jehovah too if you can understand arabic you probably call him allah but since the white man your friend took your language away from you during slavery the only language you know is his language you know your friends language so you call him you call upon the same god he calls for when he s putting a rope around your neck you call for god and he calls for god but the real religion of islam doesn t teach anyone to judge another human being by the color of his skin the odd statement is used by the muslim to uh measure another man is not the man s color but the man s deeds the man s conscience behavior the man s intention and when you use that measure standard of measurement or judgement you never go wrong no more a man but a seed which will come forth again we ll know him as a prince our own black shining

the night before christmas when all through the house not a creature was stirring not even a mouse the stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that st nicholas soon would be there the children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads and mama in her kerchief and i in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winter s nap when out on the lawn there arose such a clatter i sprang from the bed to see what was the matter away to the window i flew like a flash tore open the shutters and threw up the sash the moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the lustre of mid day to objects below when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and eight tinny reindeer with a little old driver so lively and quick i knew in a moment it must be st nick more rapid than eagles his coursers they came and he whistled and shouted and called them by name now dasher now dancer now prancer and vixen on comet on cupid on on donner and blitzen to the top of the porch to the top of the wall now dash away dash away dash away all as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly when they meet with an obstacle mount to the sky so up to the house top the coursers they flew with the sleigh full of toys and st nicholas too and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof as i drew in my head and was turning around down the chimney st nicholas came with a bound he was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot a bundle of toys he had flung on his back and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack his eyes how they twinkled his dimples how merry his cheeks were like roses his nose like a cherry his droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow the stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath he had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf and i laughed when i saw him in spite of myself a wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know i had nothing to dread he spoke not a word but went straight to his work and filled all the stockings then turned with a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose and giving a nod up the chimney he rose he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle and away they all flew like the down of a thistle but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight happy
