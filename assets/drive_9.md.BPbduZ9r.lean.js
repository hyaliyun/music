i lost my phone and i wondered what i did or said that i might soon regret it was the night i can t remember with the girl i can t forget well i was reeling watching the ceiling spin the next evening when my friends walked in and when i asked them if they knew where i d been they didn t speak at first they only grinned you see i m not the type to get in fights but that might not have been the case last night because they heard that i had a word or two with the man who asked is she with you and if i took it the wrong way i guess that s not for me to say though it seems i may have slipped up when i offered him some grooming tips but at least that helps explain the cuts and bruises on my head from the night i can t remember with the girl i can t forget and it s all coming back now don t know how to react now guess i ll let it go i m not so sure i want to know well i was back at work at 9 15 when a message popped up on my screen it said pick me up at 8 45 and we can give it one more try and now that i m with her the whole thing seems a bit absurd though she never fails to tell the tale of the time she had to post my bail and for giving me a second chance i m forever in her debt since the night i can t remember she s the girl i will never forget","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"one two when he was young you d not find him doing well in school his mind would turn unto the waters always

windmill the air flair and head spin and white rappers albums really get the most spins the face of hip hop has changed a lot since eminem and if he s taking away black artists profits i look just like him claimed a culture that wasn t mine the way of the american hip hop is gentrified and where will all the people live it s like the central district beacon hill to the south end being pushed farther away because of what white people did now where s my place in a music that s been taken by my race culturally appropriated by the white face and we don t want to admit that this is existing so scared to acknowledge the benefits of our white privilege cause it s human nature to want to be part of something different especially when your ancestors are european christians and most whites don t want to acknowledge this is occurring cause we got the best deal the music without the burden of being black in a system that really wants you to rock cause all you need is a program and you can go and make hip hop and we hate the mainstream cause we re the ones that took it now we listen to aesop rock and wear t shirts that say brooklyn but it s not about black and white right i mean good music is good music regardless of what you look like but when you don t give them props isn t that selfish that s like saying rock was actually started by elvis so where does this leave me i feel like i pay dues but i ll always be a white mc i give everything i have when i write a rhyme but that doesn t change the fact that this culture s not mine but i m gonna be me so please be who you are this is something that s effortless and shouldn t be hard i said i m gonna be me so please be who you are but we still owe em 40 acres now we ve stolen their 16 bars hip hop started off on a block that i ve never been to to counteract a struggle that i ve never even been through if i think i understand just because i flow too that means i m not keeping it true nope hip hop started off on a block that i ve never been to to counteract a struggle that i ve never even been through if i think i understand just because i flow too that means i m not keeping it true i m not keeping it true now i don t rap about guns so they label me conscious but i don t rap about guns cause i wasn t forced into the projects see i was put in the position where i could choose my options blessed with the privilege that my parents could send me to college now who s going to shows the kids on the block starving or the white people with dough that can relate to my content marketed the music now adapted to the lifestyle what happened to jazz and rock and roll is happening right now where s my place in the music that s been taken by the media with white corporations controlling what they re feedin ya i brought up aesop rock but i m not even dissing dude we love hip hop and what do you think caucasians are listening to and i speak freely when i write this if a black mc examined race there goes half their fan base white kids and this is so true and we didn t even have to fight the system we just went and picked up the microphone too and we got good at it so we should be rappin but only supporting them is like burning jimi and buying clapton now clapton s incredible but no jimi no foundation so here comes history and the cultural appropriation white kids with do rags trying to practice their accents from the suburbs to the upper class mastering a language but hip hop is not just memorizing words it s rooted in authenticity something you literally can t learn  but i m gonna be me so please be who you are this is something that s effortless and shouldn t be hard i said i m gonna be me so please be who you are but as i m blessed with the privilege they re still left with the scars hip hop started off on a block that i ve never been to to counteract a struggle that i ve never even been through if i think i understand just because i flow too that means i m not keeping it true nope hip

don t expect any sympathy you were acting out of self preservation but you didn t have enough determination now the world resets to set the evil free so don t expect any sympathy because the blood

self preservation but you didn t have enough determination now the world resets to set the evil free so don t expect sympathy it s finally done i lay down my knife he fought so hard and laid down his

to change a man but that s not me i rarely drink from the bottle but i ll smoke a little weed i still live in the sticks where you wouldn t go in a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road and a country boy is all i ll ever be now it s been twelve years since i sold my soul to the devil in l a he said sign here on the dotted line and your songs they all will play he set up shop on sunset he put me up at the marquee he said you wanna sell a million records boy you better listen to me he said change your style whiten your smile you could lose a couple pounds if you want to live this life you d better lose that wife do you need your friends around i said no that s not me cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family and i like my jeans and my old t shirts and a couple extra pounds never really hurt cause a country boy is all i ll ever be cause hank taught me just how to stay alive you ll never catch me out the house without my nine or fourty five i ve got a big orange tractor and a diesel truck and my idea of heaven s chasing white tail bucks and as a country boy i know i can survive now two flags fly above my land and really sum up how i feel one is the colors that fly high and proud the red the white the blue the other one s got a rattlesnake with a simple statement made don t tread on me is what it says and i ll take that to my grave because this is me i m proud to be american and strong in my beliefs and i ve said it before but i ll say it again cause i ve never needed government to hold my hand and i ve said it before but i ll say it again cause my family s always fought and died to save this land and a country boy is all i ll ever be charlie daniels i love my country i love my guns i love my family i love the way it is now and anybody that tries to change it has to come through me that should be all of our attitudes cause this is america and a country boy is good enough for me son","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"black water hattie

sweet sixteen how did that fit within your picnic scene sometimes it s too late to fix these things the pristine dream was over had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed with skin the darkest pigment seen and so i kicked and screamed until we found the peace that distance brings a mixed race queen that was your thoughts about her momma up yonder went her soul your hate growed

kill ya nah baby girl that s not an excuse cause i probably coulda put that gym membership to use i put on the weight you put on the breaks now we both sit around with that look on our face you wonder who i m seein and i wonder who you seein but we too afraid to ask cause we both got our demons the reason we should try to keep this thing together cause we stood by each other through all types of weather now all that taking you for granted done stopped and the love that we standin on is solid as a rock not for nothin but a couple months back when we fought i couldn t live with myself thinkin that you were lost but now we found common ground the crib felt empty never havin you around now we getting down and the sex is full throttle chilling on the couch watching next top model don t wanna be nowhere else it was time for me to put the pimp game on the shelf you help with the bills and i help with the meals they say that i m whooped but it s cool i know the deal i found a real woman that

still so in love with song writing so what i ve done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i ll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i d always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can t stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing uh uh uh oh oh oh oh i oh oh oh oh oh oh i oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i i i na na na na waiting at the back door they re around and the vultures come around and you know that they won t they won t us say what they want bout say what they want bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i m not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run baby i know some places we won t be found and they ll be chasing their
