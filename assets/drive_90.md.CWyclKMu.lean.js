the same of love and spread it across the nations we could build a better world for ours and future generations if we try and put our differences to the side its one world one love no we dont need to divide and it dont matter if you red yellow black brown or white middle class rich or poor cause were all human right so whats it gonna take to overcome the hate if fighting fires with fires just

different kind in the city of aleppo you took a deep breath this morning waking up from your pillow and eric garner had his taken when they wouldnt let go its things thats going on today we need to be aware and just because you not involved dont mean you shouldnt care theres power in unity it could start with a pair or even if you by yourself you know theres power in prayer cmon and if you let love guide your actions you could change somebodys life just with the smallest compassion and one day that could grow into something thats everlasting where it wouldnt be so common to see these tragedies happen yeah cause all that shade just keeps us in the dark and there aint no greater light than the one thats inside your heart so let it shine as big and bright as it can we got the power of change

driving me around in an old convertible the whole time around l a later on it turned into a vw van and near the end it was more like this spaceship kind of thing and were high up looking over the road but the front console was shaped like a van and it still had the convertible top the guy who was driving me around was an older dude an old hipster with a scratchy voice kind of like joe walsh sings but he kind of had some of that vibe and energy of dennis hopper in easy rider yeah like if you can imagine a cross between joe walsh and dennis hopper that s the dude who was driving me verse 2 we were heading due north on the pch coming up to the big stoplight where sunset boulevard ends and were gonna head out past there toward malibu maybe circle up through topanga canyon and come back through the valley the light was beautiful in the dream with all that nice washed out orange from the pollution so i had this happy feeling in my stomach but also like this scared feeling like something gonna happen but i didn t know what anyhow as we approaching the light at sunset all of a sudden this cat in a sports car came out of nowhere and just cut us off my man slammed on the brakes and narrowly averted a mash up it got my blood boiling but you know i wasn t the one driving verse 3 yeah so wouldn t you know it we pulled right up behind that motherfucker at the light and there he was glaring at us through his rear view he was all like yeah that s right i cut you off what are you going to do about it so i said to joe walsh slash dennis hopper i ll just call him joe now so i said to joe man aren t you gonna say some shit to that douchebag i was all puffed up and pissed off but i was sitting in the passenger seat so joe was quiet and looked straight ahead and said you know man the only way i m gonna put some shit out there like that is if i m ready to dance with that cat you know what i mean all you ve got are your actions man and don t forget your words are you actions too you put something out there there s consequences you know you wanna dance with that dude verse 4 you know now i realize that joe was driving me around everywhere and it s like i wasn t even thanking him i realize that at first i thought he was kind of wild and a bad influence on me like from my party days but actually the whole time he kind of like driving me around and taking care of me watching my back like the crazy dude in the small car like how he actually handled that while thing real noble and didn t get all ruffled he was talking me down from something i only realized that when i woke up verse 5 it s funny how sometimes with dreams you don t realize who s your friend until after you wake up then when you wake up you get this clarity and you see that maybe all these different people were you in the dream and that they re there to lead you to either good or trouble and the person who s actually acting as you in the dream is kind of like this blind idiot who s just barreling through the whole dream like i was trying to be all tough and shit telling old joe to go start something with that punk in the sports car yeah but maybe like that crazy dude in the other car was me as well all those people are just composite of my own shit all the different parts of me like you ve got this one part of you that watches out for you and keeps you steady you ve got this other part that s raging and full of anger and those two are vying for your attention like old joe and the crazy dude in the dream and then there s just you and you re listening to both of those voices but they re all a part of you you know i think of it like taming a dragon the dragon is the crazy dude and if you don t watch out he ll bite your ass hard so you need old joe there to set you straight but joe knows about the dragon because joe and the dragon are a part of you so don t try to kill the dragon you know the dragon s where you get all that voodoo shit from that s where you get your power

the music when the ocean breathes wish that i could build a bridge across the sea and the secrets of the moonlight would carry me where the sun meets the water and the sky breaks free that s where i

but you never heard me scream in silence i was on the dark side i was sailing through the night i m playing cards at the devil s table i lost my hand to a hand less table every time i hear the music when the ocean breathes make me wish that i could build a bridge across the sea and the secrets of the moonlight would carry me where the sun meets the water and the sky breaks free is that where you

be searching far and wide for what you lost along the ride when you sail to find me let the wind remind thee of a shipwrecked sailor that was saved by a maiden and sent out to sea that s where i ll be

talking till i she knows not to take it personal until ive had a cigarette my mood is irreversible thats how its always been but things have gotten worse cause now for me to start the day i gotta pop a perc started out for fun it was purely recreation but now my mind is on a permanent vacation lost my motivation lost my inspiration my mission every day is escaping from reality calling people back and paying bills a technicality it doesnt really matter cause i as long as i got twenty pills a couple new movies and my girl comes to my house to chill i even got her hooked for a while when she asked hows it feel but shes responsible she passed that phase now people look at her like why the fuck he act that way i gotta about three years ago we were doing a show and we drank like usual cause we drink for every show and my homeboy asked like hey you wanna try a percocet and i was like okay ill try it he was like yeah youll have more fun so i remember doing that show and it was just like boom it was like everything was so much brighter you can ask anybody that does dope the opiate is like utopia its tough to cope with it i quit for six weeks and do it for two months the problem with that i was just gonna do it once one day turns to two into a week until im locked inside my house and ive turned into a freak jump around my living room at five in the morning with the music so loud youd think that i was performing and if that aint a warning that ive gone too far after shopping i can never seem to find my car and its a shocking thats a fact and youre walking forth and back and youre talking to your dogs and your dogs are talking back and they are not even with you they are back up at your place only to find youre in your bathroom scratching at your face and im trapped in outerspace by then youd figure its quits i fall asleep sitting up with the cigarette lit shit wake up i started getting more like deep into it like id do it for the weekends and all of a sudden itd be monday id get high and then tuesday id get high and then id wake up in the morning and say fuck it ill just keep the blinds closed and get high from when we wake up yo till six seven in the morning and before you know it a months gone by  im acting like a clown but think that im debonair i cant dance but when im stoned im better than fred astaire with a voice like sinatra i really cant sing looking in front of the mirror posing like james dean come on lets get realistic when i quit this shit i get real distant and i dont even look at my reflection sing shit i sound like a trombone section stoned i feel young detoxed i feel old feels like my fucking hearts gonna stop then explode so cold i start shaking my body is aching well thats what i get for partying in the matrix i got a problem lets face it while you listen to this song im probably wasted acting crazy people looking at me like im a pyscho gotta give my a head a shake its time to break this cycle need to you know you think you got that shit under control but if im doing it every day how could i be having shit under control you gotta be happy with life as it is with your mind clear you know its kind of crazy because even when i think about like myself in the future i think yeah ill have like a little secret room in my house and i can go escape for the night and get stoned its kind of fucked up i guess its like im incorporating getting high into my future thats probably not the best look4","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"this is my letter to you we started following a certain description we started simple
