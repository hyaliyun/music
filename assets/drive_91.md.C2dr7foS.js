military compound the gate has a guard shack where the guard sit there and control the worker movement in and out of the factory the factory made of tin panels tin roof it s really hot the temperature over there is regularly ninety degrees and inside the factory it reach way over a hundred degrees yeah it s a contemporary form of slavery they call it slave labor but they don t prosecute them cause it s how they make paper when you rocking that fly shit that s made in china by an eight year old child trying to feed his mama he exposed to contamination and disease and only fifty five percent of them will get degrees and the women have to try to placate the boss because of sex discrimination in the labor force the slave master only let them speak in sign language and they suffering from lung disease and eye damage fourteen hour shifts seven days a week two shitty meals a day very little sleep human life only worth three cents an hour all human rights lost no sense of power working for a hundred years in the grave passes only the improved cleverness of slave masters is life worth living if you living in hell when the mind is confined to a prisoner cell and the lies they devise and the system it fail but i expect the system to fail is life worth living if you living in hell when the mind is confined to a prisoner cell and the lies they devise and the system it fail but i expect the system to fail many chinese workers are forced to sign secret agreements known as shadow contracts before they leave china severely and in some ways illegally restricting their activities while on american soil workers are forbidden to participate in any religious or political activities or to ask for a salary increase or even to fall in love or get married it s 1 6 million people locked in jail they the new slave labor force trapped in hell they generate over a billion dollars worth of power and only gettin paid twenty cents an hour they make clothes for mcdonald s and for applebee s and working forty hour shifts in prison factories and while we sit around debating who the wack mc s they have to work when arthritic pain attack the knees slavery s not illegal that s a fucking lie it s illegal unless it s for conviction of a crime the main objective is to get you in your fucking prime and keep the prison full and not give you a fucking dime but they the real criminal keeping you confined for a petty crime but they give you two to nine and ain t nobody there to protect ya except a bunch of incompetent human rights inspectors  the sweatshop situation kind of conveys it and kind of take advantage of the people that are poor and at an economic disadvantage this chinese woman made t shirts and pants at the factory until she became pregnant says she refused to have the abortion and has now been barred from entering the factory allowing them to bring that onto us soil is a very big concern we ve now documented the fact that management coerces female workers who

racing i ll make it to the ending even though i travel last through treacherous things pitfalls filled with liars snakes spotters and thieves i leave outta the siege just me trying to breathe take flight from my life and be finally free at least for the moment and try to wind down release my emotion and find my light now but then i step back in the game with a new suit on fresh to death feeling

you handle stress it s time compressed in the capsules of life all derivatives of joy hate and strife and i won t can t i ll never give in cause i hope love and passion within and i lift my eyes to

nominated myself to deliver the news that its hard for a man to choose a lady that already got a baby although his feelings may be strong having kids that don t belong to him holding on to him somehow seems wrong to him exposing them to a man who may one day decide he s tired of the family life and now he s gotta tell that little girl a goodbye lie when he s the only dad she s ever had in her life i don t wanna take that chance please don t take offense it s just the thought of hurting somebody that was innocent chorus she got kids and i don t know if i m ready to give them the things that they need to live cause if we become more than just friends what i do for her i gotta do for them kids she got kids and i just wanna make sure this is more than just some sexual trip see all i wanna do is prevent those kids from getting hurt again 2nd verse most men think it but they ll never say it but what if ya ll had another baby and he s accused of choosing favorites and they re right would he be wrong for loving his own flesh and blood a little more is he being human or only being immature who s to say that s why it s better just to wait take love day to day and let love spread its own wings and if it wants to fly away or if it decides to stay it won t be because of any unrealistic expectations ya ll done made and he won t have to pray that little girl ain t awake when he tiptoe out the

ll awake from this dream this terrible dream chorus a man who s lost his vision will live and die alone in the cold walls of this prison my heart has turned to stone the lights are growing dimmer as i take my final breath i can smell the air of freedom as i close my eyes in death chorus maybe some early morning in a pasture of green beside the still water i ll awake from this dream this terrible

the mountain grade i quickly doused the light to try to see into the night maybe i could spot her headlight in the rain she was pounding down the road i could hear her whistle blow and i thought lord what a high and mournful sound then the telegraph beganthere s a cave in at the mine and a hundred men are buried beneath the ground but lord she s coming now i see around the bend and straight at me and her boiler s glowing red as coal in hell the headlight s switching wide searching all the mountainside but the only sound she s making is the wail then i recognize the train by the number and the name it s the miner s silver ghost old 41 then she vanished up the track by the lonely switchman s shack like a mother who is looking for her son now i recall the story of the train that went to glory over fifty years ago on this same night she was stealing for the cave in there were men that needed saving but she missed the curve and trestle near the mine now every now and then you ll hear her

with will have a great impact on what kind of life you live there are people god has already ordained to come across our path to helps fulfill our destiny people that inspire us challenge us make us better the right people have already been lined up but here s the key if you re spending time with the wrong people you ll never meet the right ones if you re hanging around people that are not going any place people that are dragging you down cause you to compromise draining your energy then you re going to get stuck you can t hang out with chickens and expect to soar with eagles you re going to become like the people you continually associate with you wanna know what you re gonna be like in 5 years look at your friends if your friends are going places have a spirit of excellence kind generous courteous then those qualities are going to rub off on you gotta get these blessings so tired of stressing learning new lessons planning questions it s time for testing never ever resting i mma stay grinding so i stay shining like a diamond i mma stay climbing to the next level and do time and trying to line up with them bosses trying to soar high with them eagles can t chill with none of you chickens i m tray get rich with my people too high to see you haters too blessed to play y all mind i ain t got nothing to be mad at i m drop head top down thank you god all the time for helping me live my dreams and for exposing all of those who wasn t right for my team i mma keep receiving this games if it s for the better i ll change only live once better do it right i m trying to leave a legacy man  complainers find other complainers that s the saying birds of a feather flock together my challenge is simple make sure you re flocking to the right group victorious people associate with other victorious people winners hang out with winners happy people around other happy people eagles soar with other eagles we don t like change we want it to be just like it was when we were hanging out growing up together but it s a new day you have children you have parents to take care of you have more responsibility it s a new day i got kids to feed plus i got needs understand that please before you try to blame me by being greedy i m just trying to be all i can be you should ve stayed down instead of knocking game now you re on the sideline watching me feeling like i m where you re supposed to be man cause you ain t see what i see i put god first and went and got it see i came in the game focused you was playing games in the projects got tired of being at the bottom trying to take my family to the top only wanna work with them winners and keep raising up my stock you still posted on the same block trying to move work out the same spot treating jail like it s in and out and every time you get out you got your hand out i don t know what your new plan but but it ain t working if you re still hurting no more excuses no more complaining just praying hard with hard working but just because somebody is related to you doesn t mean they re connected to you they may have your blood but they don t have your spirit they may not have heard the call god put on your life this doesn t make them a bad person it just means god has a different assignment for them maybe they re at a different level in their growth but they re not right for you in this season this is one of the hardest things we have to deal with letting go of people that are not supposed to be in our lives can t let you slow me down can t let you slow me down can t let you hold me down can t let you hold me down if you ain t trying to get better better move around if you ain t helping you hurting i m trying to chase that crown i pray for success i pray you re blessed i pray for your best but all the stress that you brought in my life i lost all respect we family so it s all good i ain t tripping i ll still speak but the trust has been broken i working with me being by myself i m at peace i m too old to be out on these streets i gotta take care of my kids i ain t got time to have beef i just got time to do me and see what s next out there for me to see ain t trying to block my blessings so i listen to god when he speaks bottom line don t hold on to what god is asking you to walk away from another thought you shouldn t spend a lot of time with people that are always negative people that are constantly discouraged you gotta keep them cheered up keep them fixed now i m all for helping people i m all for being a blessing sometimes we have to love people back into wholeness but if you re always giving and never receiving that s an unhealthy relationship you need to gradually make a change","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"eeh so unuh waan take it personal unuh a talk bout

with them and pretend that im 7 7 seven years old once the fear had finally gone away until i saw my fathers ghost inside my childhood homes window panes and some silent shadowed matter followed me around the halls of my house when i was eight so ive held onto the belief that theres something dark lurking around my family to this day ive used up all 999 lives so by the 10th time i die ill be right by your side and well both agree that we tried to land on out feet i know i know me neither nobody believes in demons until theyve seen them and no i dont smoke no ganga and i m not gonna smoke that ganga because all of my friends already smoked enough ganga for two of my lifetimes and i fell apart while i watched them fall apart so i figure ive got enough falling apart in my system already and im scared for my family theyve already bitten him up pretty bad and the swellings spreading to my moms side of the bed and im thinking hard lately about getting some meds to help clear up this depression thats coulding my head but those tiny little red and white and black and green and yellow and orange and blue pills scare me half to death when i was little my mom hung and elephant on my wall and i had to pray to god that it wouldnt eat me in my sleep im a little older now and still learning what i think about my depressive tendencies but i know with all my heart that the same god that kept me alive then is the same one holds my hand when im weak and gives me hugs when i weep and i dont want smoke to be the reason for my rock and roll i dont want substance to be the reason my

the music and follow the drum it only appears in the dead of the night children become mesmerized at the sight one minute they re there in their beds sound asleep when they see or hear it they re bound to creep right out of their houses they re drawn right up to it it s much too spectacular they have to do it they stand right before it like it s just a dream cause it s the most beautiful sight that they ve ever seen the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the children have gathered they re standing around it it s never been here before they all astounded they wanna get on it but is it for free they don t see anyone collecting a fee who s gonna be the first to jump on aboard it finally one kid does then the rest they hoard it some jump on horses some jump on elephants some just relax and sit on a bench the kids all enjoy the ride up and down all while the carousel spins around the lights and the music it s all captivating little do they know it s all devastating as the ride spins all the kids aboard cheer nobody notices they ve grown a year the children keep riding as time goes by they re aging in years on this mystical ride  the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round first they re all the teenagers they keep on spinning then they re all young adults all of em grinning they re blind to the fact they re aging in time once little kids now they re all in their prime but they just keep riding it lights up the darkness something so beautiful truly is heartless the neighbors and parents all peacefully sleep while this carousel attracted their children like sheep well children they were now they re middle aged adults still growing older the carousel s fault the merry go spins as the times go by the children are now so old they re about to die finally the carousel slows its roll to these elderly victims it s taken its toll all of them exit and realize their damages and just like that the carousel vanishes the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round the lights on the carousel spin around and round and all the old people tried to return home but they were all thought to be senile their entire lives wasted on one ride

girl that i love so in anger i challenged his right for the love of this maiden down went his hand for the gun that he wore my challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat the handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor just for a moment i stood there in silence shocked by the foul evil deed i had done many thoughts raced through my mind as i stood there i had but one chance and that was to run out through the back door of rosa s i ran out where the horses were tied i caught a good one it looked like it could run up on its back and away i did ride just as fast as i could from the west texas town of el paso out to the badlands of new mexico  back in el paso my life would be worthless everything s gone in life nothing is left it s been so long since i ve seen the young maiden my love is stronger than my fear of death i saddled up and away i did go riding alone in the dark maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me tonight nothing s worse than this pain in my heart and at last here i am on the hill overlooking el paso i can see rosa s cantina below my love is strong and it pushes me onward down off the hill to feleena i go off to my right i see five mounted cowboys off to my left ride a dozen or more shouting and shooting i can t let them catch me i have to make it to rosa s back door something is dreadfully wrong for i feel a deep burning pain in my side though i am trying to stay in the saddle i m getting weary unable to ride but my love for feleena is strong and i rise where i ve fallen though i am weary i can t stop to rest i see the white puff of smoke from the rifle i
