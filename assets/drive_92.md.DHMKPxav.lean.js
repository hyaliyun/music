of them worked on the daytime shift on break time kicked it the sparks just flew she said she heard through the grapevine he had a girlfriend he told her nah we re through but what they had in common was a fucked up life shit she experienced he had gone through too both of them thought that the world was against them childhood innocence gone too soon they hooked up later she moved in with him and his parents she was detoxing he did meth too it helped him write songs but he quit writing shit the minute she got clean you would think that things got better but they didn t cause instead of doing drugs they d just sit around and drink day in and day out cause they hate being sober they broke as a joke and they think that everything is bad but it all seems ok when we re turning up the bottle trying to see the sun but the sky seems so gray drowning in our sorrow oh oh o oh turning up the bottle oh oh o oh drowning in our sorrow his parents kicked him out they was sick of the drinking it was constant they moved in with her sister and her fiance at the spot where her mom lived now they can drink without a conscience no one was there to tell them it was time to grow up she worked nights at the bar but they shared one car he would pick her up and drive home drunk when they re drinking was the only time that life don t suck only problem was they would fight so much had to hide any guns in the house cause they might go nuts shoot each other or they might go fuck it could go either way 09 came adios to 08 both of them got laid off so did her mom and her sister facing foreclosure with nowhere to stay no dough put away ramon noodles every night they applied everywhere to try to get a job looking like white trash wearing hand me down clothes to the job interviews still nobody ever called running out of time running out of alcohol maybe if they sobered up then the shit would change but instead they keep on emptying the piggy bank up in the liquor store buying something cheap to drank because  he went to a specialist the doctor said he had an ulcer in his stomach probably cause he d eat and then he d tried to make himself throw up and vomit making room so he could drink cause he s a drunk and he s a glutton but the combination s common but the fact that he was young with stomach problems was alarming but the ulcer wasn t cancerous right then he made a promise to his mama he would quit he s full of shit he wasn t honest cause he only went a month and started chugging out the bottle she was getting sick and always shaking she s afraid cause everything she ate was coming up one day she made a date to see the doctor told him shes an alcoholic so they checked her liver noticed the aluminum and fluids were below the level plus the color of her skin and eyes had turned a tone of yellow indicating that she may have got cirrhosis of the liver or maybe hepatitis maybe nothing told her not to drink a lick of liquor but she never listens turning up that bottle next to nothing ya uh yeah6","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"wanna make a bet we ll be neck to neck taking off the gloves spider versus bat tiger versus rat rabbit versus dove wanna make a bet odds are neck to

accident i know some people get a whole lot of rocking in the rocking chair and the ones who dont sometimes get rocks in their voice boxes and their voice boxes become slingshots maybe you think my heart looks like a baby squirrel but you absolutely missed when you told the class i have head lice cause i one hundred percent absolutely do not have head lice and even if i do it is a fact that head lice prefer clean heads over dirty ones so i am clean as a whistle on a tea pot my mother says it is totally fine if i blow off steam as long as i speak in an octave my kindness can still reach my kindness knows mermaids never ever miss their legs in the water cause there are better ways to move through the ocean than kicking so guess what if i ever have my own team i am picking everyone first even the worst kid and the kid with the stutter like a skipping record cause i know all of us are scratched even if you cant hear it when we speak my mother says most people have heartbeats that are knocking on doors that will never open and i know my heart is a broken freezer chest cause i can never keep anything frozen so no i am not always crying i am just thawing outside of the lines and even if i am always crying it is a fact that salt is the only reason everything floats so good in the dead sea and just cause no one ever passes notes to me doesnt mean i am not super duper in fact my super duper might be a buoy or a paper boat the next time your nose gets stuck up the river cause it is a fact that our hearts stop every for a milli second every time we sneeze and some peoples houses have too much dust some peoples fathers are like attics ive heard attics have monsters in their walls and shaky stares i think if i lived in a house with attic id nightmare a burglar in my safety chest and maybe id look for rest in the sticks and stones cause my mother says a person can only swallow so much punch before hes drunk on his own fist but the only drunk i ever knew was sleeping in the alley behind our church and jesus turned water into his wine so even god has his bad days but on your bad days couldnt you just say hey im having a bad day instead of telling me im stupid or poor or telling me i dress like a boy cause maybe i am a boy and a girl maybe my name is andrea andrew so what it is a fact that bumblebees have hair on their eyes and humans also should comb though everything they see like an anchorman is not a sailor like the clouds might be a pillow fight like my mother says every bird perched on a telephone wire will listen to the conversations running through its feet to decide the direction of its flight so i know every word we speak can make hurricanes in peoples weather veins or shine their shiny shine so maybe sometime you could sit beside me on the bus and i could say guess what it is a fact that manatees have vocal chords but do not have ears and beethoven made music even when he could no longer hear and i know every belt that has hit someones back is still a belt that was built to hold something up and it is fact that egyptians slept on pillows made of stone but its not hard for me to dream that maybe one day youll write me back like the day i wrote the lightening bug to say i smashed my mason jar and i threw away the lid i didnt want to take a chance that id grow up to be a war i want to be a belly dance or an accordion or a pogo stick or the fingerprints the mason left in the mortar between the bricks to prove that he was here that he built a roof over someones head to keep the storm from their faith my

he put his finger on the trigger and he got him some but though he don t like to admit it it was sensual and pure and he changed that day though he can t be sure if it s the sickness or the cure so there he was in front of her divine simplicity and she was speaking esperanto and drinking ginger tea as she inquired about the reason for his visit here today well he just said no reason and i really shouldn t stay and so he thought she would think that he was some kind of freak and that he d go back to the grind and that he wouldn t last a week but she didn t she just sighed and uttered softly with a smile sit down dear child what s on your mind and so he frantically described to her the kingdom at her feet as she continued with her manicure and poured another tea as he recounted tales of misery and suffering and pain she was yawning at the ceiling so he had to up his game the only thing that children cherish is to move up the ranks lucifer is in our court beelzebub is in our banks and

grabbed my arm i said ouch as i landed on the psychiatric couch he said tell me about it well the whole thing started at 3 oclock fast it was all over by a quarter past i was down in the sewer with some little lover when i peeked out from a manhole cover wondering who turned the lights on us well i got up and i walked around up and down the lonesome town i stood a wondering which way to go i lit a cigarette on a parking meter and walked on down the road it was a normal day well i rung the fallout shelter bell and i leaned my head and i give a yell give me a string bean im a hungry man a shotgun fired and away i ran i dont blame him too much though he didn t know me down at the corner by the hot dog stand i seen a man i said howdy friend i guess theres just us two he screamed a bit and away he flew thought i was a communist  well i spied me a girl and before she could leave i said lets go and play adam and eve i took her by the hand and my heart was thumping when she said hey man you crazy or something you seen what happened last time they started well i seen me a cadillac window uptown there was nobody around i got into the drivers seat and i drove down 42nd street in my cadillac good car to drive after a war well i remember seeing some ad so i turned on my conelrad but i didnt pay the con ed bill so the radio didnt work so well turned on my record player it was rock a day johnny singing tell your ma tell your pa our loves a going to grow ooh wah ooh wah i was feeling kind of lonesome and blue i needed somebody to talk to so i called up the operator of time just to hear a voice of some kind when you hear the beep it will be 3 oclock she said that for over an hour and i hung up well the doctor interrupted me just about then saying hey ive been having the same old dreams but mine was a little different you see i dreamt the only person left after the war was me i didnt see you around well now time passed and now it seems everybodys having them dreams everybody sees their self walking around with no one else half of the people can be part right all of the time and some of the people can be all right part of the time but all of the people cant be

preservin i just know i m right with god i m certain that he will guide me through my trials and tribulations bow my head and pray and that s my rehabilitation that he will guide me through my trials and tribulations bow my head and pray and that s my rehabilitation i know it ain t easy but we gotta move on i know it gets stressful but we gotta stay strong don t let em treat you less than every

t nobody say nothing if a killer pull them choppers out and feel like spraying something can t nobody say it s wrong and we all know that s a lie somebody outside of us has to speak and rectify that s just what god did in the christian holy book why don t you crack it open sit down take a look god is communicating with us man the bible is the most thoroughly documented work of all antiquity if we can t trust in the bible then we can t trust nothing let s go why they give my book a hard time especially the new testament bitextual variance that s utterly irrelevant to the proper understanding and translation of the text yes with more manuscripts there are more variants but the more the merrier homie this is not a threat this is strong evidence we possess the original text have these manuscripts different areas different times but they all testify to the same text just blows my mind god is so ain t no words to explain how he preserved his word through desert plains and heavy rains but they try to tell us that the bible s been corrupted i say they are misinformed and they might as well cut it see flame is bout to get deep and i ain t talking scuba gear i m talking real scholarly bout to bring some proof in here p75 codex vaticanus these are two manuscripts from scriptures in the canon and when i say canon i ain t talking about boom but the collection of books that all function as the rule back to p75 it s from the second century the other is from the fourth sorry for the history one hundred fifty years these copies are separated but it s so fascinating how they are so closely related there is no team either controlling the transmission just god and his holy spirit looking out for his christians3","artist_name":"FLAME"},{"lyrics":"dear brother i solemnly come to

switched the rules up dudes were tripping when they got a glimpse of truth the moves that made was insane his crew of disciples would later write it in the bible the news of jesus the word but it seemed too absurd the majestic in flesh with those he breathed from the earth now we ve seen the father clearer than we d seen him at first in his son he s the one it was seen in his works the disciples had seen those days he said peace be still and the sea obeyed i m so amazed they was attached to the king ok but now he s telling them that soon he ll have to relocate oh no but that s no reason to grumble complain in his name because he ll send another one of the same another paraclete comforter advocate teacher the helper the one we have to get to get jesus he s coming it ain t like he ain t capable of nothing he ll convict the world of sin righteousness and judgment plus there was much more to say that he left out of the discussion but left it for the one who was coming cause would guide them into truth he would glorify the christ he d reveal to them dudes about the lord who died for life so they need not sleep on the divinity of god the 3rd person of the trinity the spirit behold the spirit he is one with our maker don t sleep he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior behold the spirit he s eternal and everlasting don t sleep he s the way the men meet the master he s the way the men meet the master he s the way the men meet the master please let me speak on person number 3 homes the one up in the trinity that most people sleep on but how could that be you can t deny that they re one he has the same divine attributes as the father and son many mistake his work and try say he ain t a person that s crazy sounds to me like it s some false teaching lurking i m assured that he s a person don t stay asleep i m burning inside to tell you bout his personality and workings he s eternal proceeding from the father he has no beginning that s prolly cause he s god bruh hovers over the water he worked within creation he always been without flaw he is perfect and amazing in the old testament he was work at in god s people in moses for example that s the man that he would speak through and these dudes joshua gideon and samson who granted him the great strength yes the holy phantom plus the prophets who told cats the lamb would be coming did it by the spirit now here of the planned king s coming he was conceived by the spirit anointed and filled he was led by the spirit and each time that he healed it was by him as well as him resisting temptation he did it all by the spirit not to mention his raising don t be a fool and sleep on the divinity of god the third person of the trinity  behold the spirit he is one with our maker don t sleep he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior behold the spirit he s eternal and everlasting don t sleep he s the way the men meet the master he s the way the men meet the master he s the way the men meet the master how does the spirit work now i could go on for days but i ll just give you a little bit and speak on some ways he came as christ told with new work on the earth in acts 2 at pentecost peep the birth of the church the holy text that we read was revealed by him god breathed and we can see that it s real by him he illuminates it to enables us to see he s how you can say it s true we enabled to believe by his work he regenerates though we depraved and thieves he rebirths us let s praise him the slaves are freed he s the spirit of promise he s the spirit of truth you ve been delivered from bondage you will experience fruit he makes us want to seek him he leads us to jesus he teaches plus he intercedes for believers it seems that hey most folks they are tripping cause his name s been marred by much emotionalism the mark of his work isn t yelling and confusion it s fruit like we see in the text and it s through him be content with his revealing the bible is closed his revelation is sufficient so abide in the scroll many act crazy and and say it s him but hear this if don t match his word then it s not of the spirit so be amazed and in awe of his divinity he s god the third person of the trinity the spirit behold the spirit he is one with our maker don t sleep he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior he s the way the men meet the savior behold the spirit he s eternal and everlasting don t

your chin and pump your fist like all these years of lovin him and this is what i get you know i had to cry lookin in your eyes you said in your life or death christ will be glorified this muscle in my chest is broken leakin but im in jesus but something s underneath it a heart that never stops beatin underneath these broken pieces there s a heart that never stops when you feel your life is bleedin there s a heart that never stops that never stops beatin  i wish i could ve been there when she found it was surgical that the thing affectin her airports was terminal i could see the devastation on her parents faces your baby girl has a bad heart and it needs replacement born this way we cant medicate it somebody has to die with a good heart then well exchange it some sort of substitute or she wont survive john q in real time she needs a savior but she had one at 14 it went down heart transplant so this one would be the second round but this procedure isnt near as crucial as the first cause this new heart will stop beatin even if it works she didnt dwell on all the stuff that she would never be if i dont get picked from this list eternal joys ahead of me the nurse said she s in denial thats why she keeps a smile no she hoped to god and the donor came at the right time thats why you hear her singin now underneath these broken pieces there s a heart that never stops when you feel your life is bleedin there s a heart that never stops never stops beatin i might not know what the answer is but i know what the answer isnt it cant be that he doesnt care or he s nonexistent sufferin s a problem and why many are rejectin god but just cause you dont know the answer doesnt mean there isnt one what if gods plan for pain isnt for you to skip it we need the nightmare to appreciate not bein in it deeper the pain deeper the game upon it s endin plus god will take our pain so serious he joined us in it jesus suffered like none other when he was on the cross why do the good die that only happened once but the good rise but not for good guys he gives new hearts and eternal life to the ones who should die he gives our pain purpose this is not in vain we endure in joy for the end joy of seein his face itll all make sense then years of sufferin made up for in an instant this may be the last breath that i take but it s okay it s fine by me oh if for some reason im not here when you wake it s okay im where i need to be oh the average life span of a heart transplant is 10 15 years my dear sister jasmine is on year 11 and as i get to know her the

what began as laughter so soon would turn to pain the sky was clear and frigid the air was thick and still now i m not one to soon forget and i bet i never will picture for a moment the perfect irony a flawless new beginning eclipsed by tragedy the uninvited stranger started dancing on his own so we said goodbye to the glowing bride and we made our way back home life was so simple then we were so innocent father and mother holding each other without warning out of nowhere like a bullet from the night crushing glass rubber and steel scorching fire glowing lights screams of terror pain and fear sounds of sirens smoke in my eyes sudden stillness wrapped in silence no more screaming no more cries stunned and bewildered cold and afraid torn up and broken frightened and dazed stunned and bewildered cold and afraid torn up and broken frightened and dazed lying on the table in this unfamiliar place i m greeted by a stranger a man without a face he said son do you remember do you even know your name then he shined a light into my eyes and said take this for the pain hopelessly drifting bathing in beautiful agony i am endlessly falling lost in this wonderful misery in peaceful sedation i lay half awake and all of the panic inside starts to fade hopelessly drifting bathing in beautiful agony tell me does this hurt you said the faceless man can you move all of your fingers can you try your best to stand i asked about the others is everyone okay he told me not to worry as he turned and looked away hopelessly drifting bathing in beautiful agony i am endlessly falling lost in this wonderful misery in peaceful sedation i lay half awake and all of the panic inside starts to fade hopelessly drifting bathing in beautiful agony day after day and night after night replaying the events did they ever see the red light over and over scene by scene like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams how can you prepare for what would happen next no son should ever have to see his father such a mess it s a miracle he lived it s a blessing no one died by the grace of god above everyone survived life was so simple then we were so innocent it will stay with us forever a nightmare
