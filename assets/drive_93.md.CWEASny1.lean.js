champion is now approaching the 18 th tee off with an insomauntible 8th stroke lead well let s wrap this thing up the gallery lets the champion know what a fine three days of golf he has had the always charming champion is now taking time to high five a young spectator and the boy the boy is awestruck haha the gallery erupts into delight go get them champ yes yes i think it would be hard to find in any sport a champion who is as beloved as this one and the encouraging gallery goes silent eight strokes ahead of the pack the champion slowly starts his back swing four oh no no apparently the honking horn had some sort of concentration effect on the champion s usual monstrous drive is that greag normen s kid or something the champion shakes it off and makes some sort of humorous remark about the horn to the gallery and they eat it up let s get the ball back on the field yes yes well now the champion his caddy and the elendent gallery make their way to the champion s ball which is unfortunately larged next to a very thick tree route the champion and his caddy talk it over he s going to play it safe and punch out with a 7 iron with a 8 stroke lead this is simply smart play by the legendary champion he approaches the ball let s watch take a swing at the ball hitting the tree route in the process oh well i i don t think that s what the champion had in mind when he took that swing the ball is now 10 yards um into the woods after ricoshaying off the tree route and ther s a look of pain on the champion s face he is shaking his hands as if to say i did not have a strong enough grip on the club when i hit the tree route and my hands are stinging quite badly the champion is starting to mutter some obscenities about the car horn which if you just joined us blew earlier during the champion s back swing at the 18 th tee off well now his caddy and friend of 25 years mr skipijankings is doing every thing he can to get the champion s mind back on track forget about the car horn let s just win this thing hahah you re right  what wonderful veteran words of wisdom the champion nods in agreement and heads into the woods to set up for his third shot which he will have to play out of a dreadfully muddy lie he s sticking with his 7 iron closes the club face a little he starts his swing and the ball did not move um if anything it s a little deeper in the mud what is this fucking quick sand the champion is now conferring with coarse marshal david canner what do i do next gonna have to drop one and yes i it has been ruled that his ball is unplayible he will take a drop and a one stroke penally and the champion is now laughing very hard uh one might say a little too hard but none of the less he drops his new areo fly ball and resumes play back with his trusty 3 wood the champion lines up his shot he starts his back swing he flatuates stops his swing and steps away from his ball and whispers something too his caddy mr skipijankings wha what do you mean you got to take a shit i ve got to shit finish the fucking hole we ve got to win this mother fucker jesus christ man well now the champion is staring angrily at his caddy he continues to star for quite some time and then abruptly walks back to his ball not taking much time set up at all he swings connects a smash of a hit starting to slice oh no it goes directly into the center of a man made water hazard you ve got to be fucking kidding me the champion slowly walks over to his golf bag unzips it and pulls out hmm what i believe is a 16 oz silver beverage container and starts drinking in large gulps why don t we take this time for a word from our sponcers and then we will return to our final round coverage of the enbuary classic what do 17 major championships over 6 million dollars in prize money and the complete domination of the sport of golf have in common two things the champion and areo fly balls areo fly balls they just seem to go further if it s good enough for the champion don t you think it s good enough for you well welcome back to our final round coverage of the enbuary classic put your shirt back on i ll tell you one thing no one s fucking up me in my hole as we join the action because thay are fucking ugly we can see his caddy and long time friend mr skipijankings trying to cox the champion out of the sand trap where he is presently on his back making a snow angle get up get the fuck up what the fuck are you doing all right well the champion is now ceasing his softmories behavior and is climbing out of the trap onto the green yee haw the champion has just tackled long time friend mr skipijankings i ve never scene any thing like this that s it i m getting the fuck out of here you re fucked up dude you need some help ya i need help fucking your wife fuck you don t you ever talk about my wife i ll fuking kill you man hear hear generally tempered long time friend mr skipijankings now storming off the forced hole not with out hearing some expletive words hurled at him by the classless lord of the lace tears streaming down his face the champion is now alone on the green left with mainly a 12 foot put who would of thought that a horn honk could bring about such disaster and disarray in one ma s life the champion now lining up his put using the flag stick as his putter for some odd reason he takes a few steps towards the hole unbuckles his belt the champion is defecating in the cup and the gallery has scene enough not a moment too soon the police have arrived and are advancing towards the champion slowly in a last desperate act the champion holds the flag stick as if it were a large lance from medieval times and runs full kilt in rage in his eyes towards the officers they open fire the champion has been shot he is down on the green he s not moving walking inching their way towards the champion the officer checks the champion s pulse and signals to the other police that the champion is sure enough dead if you are just joining us sunday may 7 th

i think about all the attacks that have happened for my home the truth is the reason why they re threatening you the reason why they re lying to you the reason why they re spending their time on you

child in the womb unafraid my eyes were open silent angel filled the room then mr jesus saved our party with his wine it s the legend of the sour grapes  she bade me to peer through yonder portal to heaven just before the sun and behold the morning angel whispering follow me now son with her light as through a finger pointing to the yonder wall traced a path of five directions and behold the holy

that spinach dip and put it in a sour bread bowl now do you think he can take my spinach dip and turn it into something maybe a little bit more useful like i don t know cocaine billy b i believe he

that nice to see you gotta go oh my god i m high as balls and there s no way he doesn t know shit is getting out of hand i m getting higher need to make a plan maybe tell mom i m sick and try to get

her no but she makes me stand pastor asks if i m just here for christmas and i say i am the congregation turns around the pastor asks me how i ve been and that s about when the goddamn shrooms decided it was time to kick the fuck on in trevor you ve really done it now holy shit what s going on what is that voice i m freaking out this is satan and you ve summoned me to seal your doom whoa hold up wait a minute i don t even think i believe in you i exist within subconsciousness down in your mind but you did drugs and went to church so now your soul is mine for all eternity you will never escape my clutch okay uh first of all i think that seems like a little much a joint and couple caps and stems is that all that a soul is worth and god made everything i ve done tonight all of it s from the earth the mushrooms and the pot yo he made it all the nitrous and the adderall muscle relaxers maybe a little coke but if that damns me for eternity then if you ask me the system s broke then satan disappeared and shrieked a shrieking sound i sent him back to hell because i fucking stood my ground the church stares at me their eyes are open wide and the pastor asks if i d stop shouting and please go outside uh sure sorry it s just that i m high in church i m high in church whatever man i guess it could be worse i m high in church that s what i am sorry mom i guess i ll be outside in the

locks on the doors when we all bedded down to sleep met a pretty young girl and made her my bride after church on sundays take the kids for a ride down the street swimming holes catching fireflies in jars spend the evening staring at the stars then the gays got married and the plant shut down and the crops dried up everywhere around then the gays started kissin and the state said cool and they made all the kids be gay in school cause them gays got married they announced it on tv jumped in my truck and slammed reverse i had to get to my family before the gay could get there first hauling ass down the interstate in my throat i could my heart i didn t know how much time i had before all the orgies would start and they re grabbing guys like me and they re pulling us out of our trucks and they re kissing our lips and nibbling our ears and all sorts of sexy stuff and they re taking us out to fancy hotels and partying the night away and they re saying how good we look in their shirt when we wake up the next day no i dare not look back to see what s behind they almost got me once when i was surfing online and as strong and straight as i know i am every man can be pushed too far i ve seen the devil and the devil looks like mario lopez in jean shorts washing his car i pulled up into my house and i quickly ran inside i grabbed my lovely spouse but i felt no love when i looked in her eyes the gay had gone airborne and i didn t make it in time my family unit had already been undermined because the gays got married and released gay spores and all the straight people weren t in love no more cause them gays got married been in this bunker three long years canned food and recycled air yet i shudder when i think bout what must be happening up there a radioactive scorched desertscape ruled by roving biker gangs with scary tattoos and muscley arms blue eyes and super cute bangs so i ll seal myself off from everyone and hide here until i die confused and angry sad and alone and i know the reason why cause the gays got married the gays got married the gays got married the gays got married","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"got a man call him my boyfriend think i m fallin in love the

your dreams make them as real as anything it d take the work out of the courage but she says please there s a crazy man that s creeping outside my door i live on the corner of grey street and the end of the world  there s an emptiness inside her and she d do anything to fill it in and though it s red blood bleeding from her now it s more like cold blue ice in her heart she feels like kicking out all the windows and setting fire to this life she could change everything about her using colors bold and bright but all the colors mix together to grey and it breaks her heart it breaks her heart to
