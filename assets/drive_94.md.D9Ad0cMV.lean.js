ground watch the flames surround watch all your fears fall like ashes all around just don t forget that you re the one who brought it down you did this on your own all i did was show you how with your head pounding harder than your heart and you feel that you re stuck where you are with your lungs filled with smoke and you know that you re heading towards the dark when it seems like this scene never ends then the least you can do is pretend that the life you ve been living is leading you out of the dark why aren t you trying to escape from the fires that i have made now you can be free from

gift to the world gave his only son to purchase sons and daughters to make us one with the son and one with the father took upon himself the condemnation we deserved resurrected after death and he promised to return filled us with the spirit to seal our election and protect us until the day that we share in his resurrection the size of grace how great the size the gates of heaven are open wide and people of all kind are welcome inside should have been denied but instead god replied he said in your place my son has died his death gave you life it s the size of grace innocent blood that was shed to erase every trace of sin for a chosen race it s the great exchange it s power to change the gospel salvation for all who believe all for his glory overcoming our hatred and sin with his divine love the love of our god gracious and kind god became a man and suffered for mankind the punishment for our sin was poured out on him so we could be forgiven and forever live saved by grace the cost was not cheap we can t add to it his work is complete the greatest gift we could ever receive it s the gospel salvation for all who believe so we pray for strength of the power of his holy spirit so

the city that made me feel like i belonged here every single day no matter where she d take me somehow she would always make me feel a part of some great tapestry the world had spun i could always look at her and not feel so alone but suddenly that s done isn t it cause now i can t make heads or tails of what we have been doing i thought stepping up and moving in would make things clear the one thing in this city that i always thought was certain was that she and i were working hard to build a future here and maybe i was careless maybe i should try to wear less of my heart upon my sleeve and let her say goodbye but i don t wanna start that now i don t want to let go cause she s the only reason why i m living in this hundred story city where you ve got to hold tight to what you care for

to be with her so i don t understand what i m supposed to do now why are there so many people in my way people hey hello i don t wanna be the person who is i don t understand these people why am i always standing still i wish that i could make the people disappear except for her no crowds no moms with strollers a flyer some space some room to get through i just want to see her no walls no bikes
