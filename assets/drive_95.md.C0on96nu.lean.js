up here boy and show us what you are i said i m dry and he bought me a beer he nodded at my guitar and said it s a tough life ain t it i just looked at him he said you ain t makin any money are you i said you ve been readin my mail he just smiled and said let me see that guitar i ve got something you oughta hear then he laid it on me if you waste your time a talkin to the people who don t listen

about me and a deeper found regret the time is wrong i d set it fast she said she knew i left her up in harlem after crushing cigarettes ok i want to be alone with you i want to do the things you do you always do feeling deeply shaken and then breaking my own rule i went into a tiki bar on 1st avenue writing in a notebook and being very english i attracted the attentions of a real couple they asked me if i d join them to society engagements so i answered that i would and then we split they lived around the corner i heard something about a dress and plastic costumes and then something about

everywhere dark liquored eyes an arabian nightmare she shone on watercolors of my pond life as pearl until those who couldn t have her cut her free of this world that fateful eve when the breeze stank of sunset and camphor their lanterns chased phantoms and threw an inquisitive glance like the shadows they cast on my love picking rue by the light of the moon putting reason to flight or to death is

wept til tears crept back to prayer she d sworn me vows in fragrant blood never to part lest jealous heaven stole our hearts then this i screamed come back to me for i was born in love with thee so why should fate stand in between and as i drowned her gentle curves with dreams unsaid and final words i espied a gleam trodden to earth the church bell tower key the village mourned her by the by for she d been a witch their men had longed to try and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs my tortured soul on ice a queen of snow far beyond compare lips attuned to symmetry sought her everywhere

still and too old to hang out with tom dick or harry i got sick of the toxic spew coming from the mouth of every hot chick i ve got into so i ve started answering to todd jack or larry and now i don t go out so much i stay home you could say i m out of touch and when my friends say have you heard that new album the one by such and such i m like who and who are you i ve haven t had friends for months i mean i do have friends they just forgot my name and never come to the ends see they don t like the train or the track so now i sit alone and pretend that i ever get the jubilee line see i don t see her much of the time i tend to favour victoria s vibe as if i go out i usually decline i ll stay home if you wouldn t mind i mean if you wouldn t mind4","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i want

to get a degree why let me tell you what society will tell you increases your chances of getting a job provides you an opportunity to be successful be a lot less stressful education is the key now let me tell you something your parents will tell you make me proud increases your chances of getting a job provides you an opportunity to be successful your life will be a lot less stressful education is the key now let s look at the statistics steve jobs net worth seven billion r i p richard branson net worth four point two billion oprah winfrey two point seven billion mark zuckerberg henry ford steven spielberg bill gates now here comes the coup de grce looking at these individuals what s your conclusion neither of them in being successful ever graduated from a higher learning institution now some of you may be like money is only the medium by which we measure worldly success and some of you even have the nerve to say i don t do it for the money so what you studying for to work for a charity need more clarity let s look at the statistics jesus muhammed socrates malcolm x mother teresa spielberg shakespeare beethoven jesse owens muhammad ali sean carter michael jeffrey jordan michael joseph jackson were either of these people unsuccessful or uneducated all i m saying is that if there was a family tree hard work and education would be related but school would probably be a distant cousin because if education is the key school is the lock because it rarely ever develops your mind to the point where it can perceive red as green and continue to go when someone else said stop because as long as you follow the rules and pass exams your cool but are you aware that examiners have a checklist and if your answer is something outside the box then the automatic response is a cross and then they claim that school expands your horizons and your visions well tell that to malcolm x who dropped out of school and is world renowned for what he learn in a prison proverbs 17 16 it does a fool no good to spend money on an education why because he has no common sense george bush need i say more education is about inspiring one s mind not just filling their head and take this from me because i m an educated man myself who only came to this realization after countless nights in the library with a can of red bull keeping me awake till morning another can in the morning falling asleep between piles of books that probably equates to the same amount i spent on my rent memorize equations facts and dates write down to the letter half of which i would never remember and half of which i would forget straight after the exam before the start of the next semester asking anyone if they had notes for the last lecture i often found myself running to class just so i could find a spot on which i could rest my head and just sleep without making a scene ironic because that s the only time i ever spent in university chasing my dreams and then after nights with a dead mind i d den find myself in a queue of half awake students zombies waiting to hand in an assignment maybe that s why they call it a deadline and then after three years of mental suppression and frustration my proud mother didn t even turn up to my graduation now i m not saying that school is evil and there s nothing to gain all i m saying is understand your motives and re assess your aims if you want a job working for someone else then help yourself but then that would be a contradiction because you wouldn t really be helping yourself you d be helping somebody else there s a saying that is if you don t build your dreams someone else will hire you to help build theirs redefine how you view education understand it s true meaning education is not just about regurgitating facts from a book or someone else s opinion on a subject to pass an exam look at it picasso was educated at creating art shakespeare was educated in the art of all that was written colonel harland sanders was educated in the art of creating kentucky fried chicken i once saw david beckham take a free kick i watched as the side of his adidas sponsored boot hit the patent leather of the ball at an angle which caused it to travel towards the skies as though it was destined for the heavens and then as it reached the peek of it s momentum as though it changed it s mind it switched directions i watched as the goalkeeper froze as though reciting to himself the laws of physics and as though his brain was negotiating with his eyes that was indeed witnessing the spectacle that was the leather swan that was swooping towards it and then reacted though only a fraction of a millisecond too late and before the net of the goal embraced the fifa sponsored ball as though it was the prodigal son returning home and the country that i live in erupted into cheers i looked at the play and thought damn looking at david beckham there s more than one way in this world to be an educated man peace 69","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"shawty

to the hood again where kids hold chrome with them just to feel protected cause the videos are showing them how to shoot fools and take their dough from them that s why i try to give my soul to them in i spit they rejected cause they stressing for material shit they re getting sick and tired of fighting over serial gifts cause they notice bitches go head over heels for the whips and the chains and the chips and the range and the clips in the guns and the women and the fun living in cribs in the burbs fuck the slums they want funds and they heard flippin birds is the ticket and they get it and run with it some slip and fall others pause see the outcome and crawl on the road for some change cause the game is too hard to play straight by the rules i m trying to stay out the news and make cake to buy food fuck jewels i think my soul glows bright enough and fuck whips i learn more when i ride the bus and fuck gold it s bad enough that we fight for bucks and fuck hoes cause in the end i

she s as patient as students of ornithology she seems to wait for nothing but the close of the day then all of a sudden just like i had prayed i see her start to look my way i m as self conscious and nervous as a first time virgin drug smuggler i m doing my best to keep my eyes from constantly being obvious and staring at her i play with my phone start texting a mate i hope they call back that sucks cause i m here she s hot and it s great  i take a little walk over to the bar on the beach the other english guys are as burnt as me i order a beer cause i m feeling real thirsty i know it should be water cause this ll dehydrate me to my surprise as i am sitting here she sits right down right next to me and orders a beer she speaks just like a native girl she s humming a song i m resisting every tempting moment where i m thinking i can just sing right along singing along and now i can t believe it but she asked me where i m from her accent is thick i definitely wasn t wrong i tell her i m from london and she seems impressed we start joking about the cold the wind the rain and the fog well all i try and do is stop staring at her chest she d love to move away and pursue her career she studied at the university over here she said she had some trouble getting hold of a visa i said i would marry her seemed to please her it was all going well so i ordered some shots it went straight to my head cause i was tired and hot this girl she had no problem with all of the tequila i was just so shamelessly trying to feed her i knew i was mangled when i tried to stand i had double vision and the room span she grabbed my arm to keep me steady and she asked me in that cute voice are you feeling horny we were staggering up the four flights of stairs together i began to imagine me ensuing pleasure as we entered the room she began to undress she seductively asked me to turn around quickly to increase the suspense closing my eyes was like entering a vortex was i even going to manage to get through the sex and so before it even all began she battered me over the head with the bedside lamp i awoke the next morning and i was feeling like crap all that was left was the shirt on my back she must have spiked my drink i could feel it in my throat on the side of the table she d left me a note thanks for last night i don t need a visa why would i move life is just easier there
