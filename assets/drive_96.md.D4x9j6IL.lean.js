night one day he had to up and leave there he couldn t take the drawn out fights he even caught the nasty thoughts never spoken but so spiritless and mean how they echoed among their lives so if you see those so called demons don t bother saying i said hi i think they both know where to find me i think i ve stared at them both dead in their eyes i ll probably see them in some time now our crooked paths could easily cross or wind forever in a lonelier direction because there ain t a lot of fight left in damaged souls like us see you can always find quiet but you can t really ever find peace if

shared i try to recreate i know this is wrong better stop this talk cause grass can grow up through a crack in the sidewalk and what i see when i look in your eyes grass that s truly greenest

was toting the four fifth and now there was a need for a rapper who uplifted foes tried to copy but the flow was so godly i could give them rhyme books they still couldn t spit it goooooooood see it s the way that i m leaning on the words or my past with them ratchets trouble scheming on a bird northface over the hoodie cold season on the curb but i could feel the difference when gangstas looked me in the eyes peddling the dro while the sourcers cooked pies i would rhyme while they cook provide seasoning and herb multiple submissions i be pissing off dopeshake my bad i m just hungry trying bake cake not as in bread or money but the cooch box i give life my straw until she leaking out her juice box too many raps about the sizes in they shoe box or how they shoot glocks i move knots around these fake greats its like every rapper smokes until he s high make it rain until it floods or copping dope and cooking pies all these young dudes got wings but never fly peacocks street not the heat cock too many die see devine is an eagle so when rhyming to the people i gotta snatch their cerebral from the street to the sky the worm out the apple hook the fish from out the harbor then i fathered two daughters and now the gods dodging karma but what do expect when a king sits upon his porcelain to poop and his manhood is nearly dipping in the water i paint vivid pics so even the blind envision the slaughter i will die for what i author take me out devine s a martyr did a complete 180 from a brothel to a nunnery obviously not literally the opposite tongue and cheek but if one of my angels gets pregnant my genes better shine through bright i want to see my daughters son in me compile zip files of gandhi knowledge in a summary console my grand son when he dreams of coppers gunning me i m a revolutionary to the reverends truth vary the message to youth scary in the darkness bring the sun with me trying to stay in shape i m on a low carb diet i gotta match my queen s shape i m the star of her iris when my soul is lethargic and tired she makes me whole now i flow with these bars from papyrus my archdiocese march and riot and spark fires target my highest market with fliers until i chart higher and song stays in rotation like car tires and keep they ear to the streets like narc wires while i m chilling in the dark by a barn fire reading the bible trying to absorb chapter mark in quiet but sheisty said quit rapping like martin luther recapture my past as lucifer start acting stupid i don t have to go back to them packs blasting ruggers just target these wack rappers and attack them with bars ruthless ok see i use to plague adolf hitler s dreams and thoughts the king they called nigga i m the cape that offed the riddler i m the black zolf digler that paint bars like pictures i trained hard with these just blame god i m gifted with each stroke a vessel i m artistic i m so special i m autistic in the vestibule with the arch bishops i live with the kings but march with niggas lyrically bruce lee with the art sparing with ninjas i m authentic the god splendid i tell my queen not to lose her arch see i m use to wombs of broads timid in the back of cars rented killing

the lizards would be saved he said if they could be enlightened by the writings of the helping friendly book in all of prussia only one existed and wilson had declared that any person who possessed it

sunk and as his body disappeared before me i bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk he said i come from the land of darkness he said i come from the land of doom he

in the water and swam toward the region where rutherford lay and in a flash the beast was gone underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while forbin bewildered waited alone the seconds dragging by him seemed like hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream defeated he bowed his head and turned to go suddenly with a roar the creature emerged before him and held the

budged it slid through to the pump my gas as the thought of all the shit she put me through but i was glad i had a reason to go see her now other than to lay her down i got a reason to treat her like a voodoo doll with this blade i found i made the sound of screeching tires as i pulled out of the station mind racing for the placement of my rage i was impatient movie in the making so i punched the dash and my front windshield cracked made it harder to see what was in front of me but i mashed on the pedal stomping through the floor with a leak in the door the wind whistled like a missile in a war or a bullet from a pistols draw reached under my seat for a bottle of whiskey and took a shot while my stomach was in a knot nerves shot i mulled over the plot when i find this bitch i ll put her in a throat lock with a rope and a sock duct taped on her mouth and make her look at a clock and every second i m going to pop one of her boyfriend s fingers with a vise grip while he s screaming at me no stop when i make it to his knees while he s tied to a metal chair with radio wires hooked to a live battery i m going to grab his head and make him stare at you while you drill holes in his

stars that glow so i got an old jar from a masons box i wrote my name on the front and poked a slot in the top and dropped in that first penny watched it rattle around and everywhere that i went i kept my eyes to the ground for a nickel dime dollar working for my papa farm chores paid more as it got hotter either bush hoggin the field or haulin some hay i would weed the whole garden for a full days pay and my daddy taught me that if you earned your way it will mean more to you when you spend it some day keep saving up your change never throw it away fill your jar to the top and put it somewhere safe welcome to my life in a jar it sure has takin me so far from the coins i collected to the grains we selected to the plants out behind the barn its my life in a jar now as i got older my

burner the best out the sticks with a smooth southern flavor no chaser a high speed racer country boy running from them atf agents back roads kickin up dust like a chicken fight navigate the sunset to keep me out the city lights spare tank of gas i can run em on e blue lights and sirens would never stop me no trace tint with no plates i was out like a light hit my destination safe its just another

plants out behind the barn its my life in a jar now the coins pile to cash but so did the grain and all this rippin and runnin was driving me insane the times have changed and so did the game it was too much risk driving state to state plus the soil was as rich as our aspirations got the right seeds and started cultivating patiently waiting with daily preparation and inch by inch we would reach out destination twelve feet tall like a cedar bush sweet skunk crossbread with that o g kush it was prime to push and the block was right and once again we filled the jars and put the lids on tight we was ground shipping through them big brown trucks and we knew that it was risky but we pushed our luck boxed and ducted sealed with a secret touch i put my life in these jars just to earn a buck i keep living my life in a jar simple life baby it sure has takin me so far knee high to a grass hoper to a grown man from the coins i collected to the grains we selected to the plants out behind the barn its my life in a jar yeah thats right just collecting money as a kid earning a dollar as a teenager and trying to start a business as a grown man you can mix all that tall up and put it in a good
