education and relation to take away your hesitation and segregation in a country full of immigrants where no one really was born here but separated here its a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white we now have a black and white president and this is what the future is to me the juxtaposition two things that you think dont go together when a black super hip hop dressed dude gets on an elevator and theres an old lady with chanel and she grabs her purse ill give you a clich example what would happen if they actually talk to each other what would she learn what would he learn when the rich man hopping out the lincoln town car passes by the homeless person and they actually talk to each other what would he learn what would he learn if a black man that came from chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people cause you do not want to be accused of being gay was to talk to a gay person what would he learn what did i learn i learned that people in chicago was wrong and ive been an asshole all along a lot of things that you learn are wrong so dont be an asshole too long too long too long you cant be an asshole too long you cant be an asshole too long cause the more you know the more you grow the more responsibility you have show what you know and give everything that you got to give baby thats the reason god let me live

bonus we re gonna be wrong as long as were breathing we need a jonah the problem ain t that we rock timbs the problem is we ve got sin even with a new start we need to be free we need a new heart the problem is not just behavior the problem is there s rot in our nature even with a new start we need to be free we need a new heart i serve word cause it s what the suburbs and the hood needs wrecking the thought that heaven s earned by your goods deeds i m mad precise when it s the afterlife you bank on good deeds but you can t think this counts like half the price sin is genetic it s the reason your appetite for it is husky like that school up in connecticut check the bible for a honest diagnosis or just smell cause you can tell like chronic halitosis we all sin you know we each are prone if only humans are affected then to each his own but god sees it and it s reached his throne in him there s no sin like there s no such thing as pizza bones we have no spiritual loot we re bankrupt and we have bad spiritual root every day we grow bad spiritual fruit we need god to hold back that spiritual boot whenever god is ready he can break down a sinner like i take a steak down for dinner the job of god the spirit is to pull a person to christ it s like it s irresistible he makes christ known your eyes light up like when the breaklight s on there s a change i ve grown i know it happened to me i met the surgeon he changed my heart then went the blunts and the cursing kept on working for certain he keeps purging now instead of bourbon i m fervently reading spurgeon that blow god handed me put me on hand and knee brought a kid that s caramel low like anthony and now can it be got me in his family repping the kingdom of god dropping him on the industry this is the truth i pray you can

went we just spent quiet time together as if silence was expensive but we were both filthy rich a question like do you love me was an itch our doctors told us not to scratch so we just prayed someone would catch it while rubbing us down after walking around with the weight of each others world on our shoulders we had hearts like boulders we played sisyphus trying to push the others uphill but we told our hearts be still let no one move you let no one lift you let no one get through that stone wall you call skin let no one in because people are clumsy and theyll break you take you apart in the study you tell the world that they knew you as if knowing was enough to make them the most foremost expert on you theyll claim that everything you did or didnt do was just another complexity solved as simply as a grade 2 problem as if by age 7 my only problem was math as if i was never 7 and more dedicated to figure out which path was quickest to the bathroom so the bullies wouldnt have the satisfaction of seeing me bleed on my clothes and god knows youd be there and so everywhere like a nightmare i couldnt stop having id wake up shaking with you there making it worth saying be still be still my boy never son just someone who it seems youre liking just someone who it seems you never tried to know so somehow without moving wed go through motions to deserts daydreaming about a time when we were oceans we were still trying to make our tides come in as if we had been throwing messages in bottles into each other and our refusal to actually write those messages was just another way to say nothing wed bring stillness home like a strayed dog and teach it to play dead tongues like leeches wed bled our voices dry while a playing dead dog would try to teach us tricks like speak but we sat silent like two blind students trying to sneak a peek at their grade 6 teacher getting dressed but we never knew what direction to look so the kids next to us always whispered eyes on your own test and i hated you all the way up until the day you finally spoke you said there will come a time when the world will look at you without concern because youve always been still they will look past you you will be as unregarded as the scenery that people take for granted youll be ruled in the perceptions of you that they have planted in their mind but all the while you will grow and after all the years you spent trying to know stillness the whole world will turn their heads unable to miss the moment when you decided to move and there will come a time when you must move move with the full force you would find behind the eyes of someone who couldve spent their life satisfying a million desires but instead decided to conquer just one move like a legion of natural disasters towards the monuments they have built in an attempt to declare greatness they have never earned move as swiftly as the knowledge learned by the students of practice move so they cannot dismiss you like sunlight through stained glass not around but through each mass they would raise against you move because being still is something they can never make you do move my boy because i love you and i thought awesome you totally taught me how to be stubborn thats great but now that youre gone now that quality has turned trait i find myself caught up in an endless debate where vs when as if i am waiting for then to become now so that the answers to why resemble reasons like somehow as if somehow was enough to encompass the rough estimate i make when i decide what direction to take for the moment i break stillness this heart is a juggernaut one that you took the time to shape against all those who would hold up red tape in the path of the life i chose to live through this is much more than my meager declaration of love this is my thank you and this is for a man who knew me well enough to know that should i ever choose to go through struggle i can set my sails like a ship breaking through the neck of a whisky bottle school was a boxing ring and the man in my corner made sure not to bring a towel to throw in ive been studying stillness watched my mother fight and lose to an illness that forced itself upon her as if it were the man she met after my father the same man who couldnt bother to stick around after the diagnosis i have known stillness this is for my granddad who had the good sense

see i can talk a good game from the stage but if you want to gage a romantic thing said when we were messing up the bed the best i can give you is oh my god were totally humping regardless theres something beautiful about stating the obvious all of us do it in the moments when we cant believe it we have to say it its like pinching yourself to make sure youre awake take for example something as simple as touching someone we so often say youre so soft and the last person to touch them may have said it for the twenty eighth time but today im number twenty nine and im not saying it for her benefit im saying it for mine because theres almost 7 billion people in the world half of which are men and when the number of them is 3 5 billion its pretty fuckin cool that i was number twenty nine and once upon a time i was first in line for a girl with freckles and strawberry blonde hair we loved like an electric chair hooked up to a nuclear power plant and plugged into the sun and everything we did had never been done i woke up the next morning with a smile that told the world im number one i think of her more often than sometimes and if she ever hears this i want her to know that our first kiss tasted like pepper i met her on june 27th that year it was yellowknifes first day of continual light and despite the sun not setting that night we each went home alone even though our parents told us be home before dark we couldve stayed out for weeks couldve watched the way the sun leaks like liquid over the horizon casting shadows over all the right places of a bargain bin where love was 75 off and we were collectively 25 away from forever there are times in the north when the sun never sets and it gets confusing when we ask ourselves questions like is it too late or too early more often than sometimes we didnt care we lived like two games of solitaire waiting to be played by one another her mother once asked me do you love her and i said if there were 1 million teachers breathing down my neck telling me that the answer is no i would say yes i guess that was enough for her because that girls father palmed me a condom and wished me a happy birthday even now theres no way to tell was that awkward or creepy we loved like two hit men hellbent on assassinating regret her orgasm was a wet gremlin multiplying itself into another her younger brother knocked on the bedroom door asking what are you guys doing in there and somewhere amid the awesome and all of the in between we replied in unison studying and we were i wrote notes on her skin in flesh toned permanent ink that would sink and sit inside as i tried to underline the important parts of her bellybutton birthmark collarbone and i wrote notes explaining that hers felt like silk stretched over stone i told her youre so soft she smiled and said duh followed by my bellybutton is not an erogenous zone and i said i hate that word and she asked which one and i said erogenous i told her theres beauty in the obvious and your bellybutton is where you started its where cells divided and grew into you so let me do what students do best you can test me later but right now let me study she said youre lucky this is a take home test boy i highlighted and double underlined lips i think of the beauty in the obvious the way it forces us to admit how it exists the way it insists on being pointed out like a bloody nose or how every time it snows there is always someone around to say its snowing but the obvious isnt showing off its only reminding us that time passes and that somewhere along the way we grow up not perfect but up and out it teaches us something about time that we are all ticking and tocking walking the fine line between days and weeks as if each second speaks of years and each month has years listening to forever but never hearing anything beyond centuries swallowed up by millenniums as if time was calculating the sums needed to fill the empty belly of eternity we so seldom understand each other but if understanding is neither here nor there and the universe is infinite then understand that no matter where we go we will always be smack dab in the middle of nowhere all we can do is share some piece of ourselves and hope that its remembered hope that we meant something to someone my chest is a cannon that i have used to take aim and shoot my heart upon this world i love the way an uncurled fist becomes a hand again because when i take notes i need it to underline the important parts of you happy sad lovely battle cry ballistic like a disaster or a lipstick earthquaking and taking out the monuments of all my hollow yesterdays well always have the obvious it reminds us who and where we are it lives like a heart shape like a jar that we hand to others and ask can you open this for me we always get the same answer not without breaking it more often than sometimes i say go for it 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"remember how we forgot remember how no one ever really died in the wars we fought because each gunshot came from our finger tips and we never really kept them loaded just in case cause each enemy was a friend and none of it was about oil religion or land it was all just pretend remember how we used to bend reality like we were circus strong men like our imaginations were in shape then like we were all ninjas trained in the deadly art of did not like i totally got you did not remember how we forgot remember how our parents told us never to look directly into the sun and how we were their son and so we never looked directly into the mirror in fear that we would go blind remember how we used to find any old reason just to call someone we were crushing on like we could just pawn off our sense of embarrassment buy a chunk of courage that would last just long enough to have us askin em about math and stuff and how stuff was just stuff like i heard you re getting braces now braces somehow were and still are kinda hot remember how we forgot remember how we all caught mono and our folks would go oh the kissing disease and our first steps into gangstahood had us saying mother please even though wed never really kissed anyone even though we never did half the things we said wed done we just spun yarn like rumpelstiltskin spun gold we told ghost stories never realizing we would one day ourselves become ghosts haunting the hallways of schools breaking all the rules of silence in the library but we had no chains to rattle no voice to battle the fact that we had no vocal chords we had only finger nails on chalk boards we would scream shout and yell trying to tell ourselves what experience can teach is what no teacher taught remember how we forgot once upon a time we were young our dreams hung like apples waiting to be picked and peeled and hope was something needing to be reeled in so we can fill the always empty big fish bin with the one that got away and proudly say that this time impossible is not an option because success is so akin to effort and opportunity they could be related so we took chances we figure skated on thin ice believed that each slice of life was served with something sweet on the side and failure was never nearly as important as the fact that we tried that in the war against frailty and limitation we supplied the determination it takes to make ideas and goals the parents of possibility and we believe ourselves to be members of this family not just one branch on one tree but a forest whose roots make up a dynasty so when i call you sis or bro its not lightly and when i ask you to remember its because the future isn t what it used to be so remember now pay tribute to every sacrifice laid upon the altar of somehow for all the times somehow we overcame somehow we pushed on somehow weve gone the distance and in going there we possessed the freedom to map the uncharted lands of any and everywhere we are unbound six feet above the underground where we will all one day rest so until then test the limits test the boundaries and borders as if the headquarters of potential lay just beyond the world s edge let the belief that hope belongs to us all be the pledge you take to make the unachievable as inconceivable as the false fact hat we were never here we were here and our memories are as dear to us as every slow motion moment or held breath so remember every instance before death every first kiss first dance near miss last chance yes no maybe so let us go the distance once more let us remember all the moments that were and were not like the point is something we can get and what we can get is what we got because all we have are the times between the moments we connect each dot so live and remember burn like an ember capable of starting fires like each moment inspires the next like memories are the context we put ourselves in so that life becomes the next of kin we need to notify in case of a big bang or extinction level event let now be our advent let us live like we meant it let us burn like we mean it because this world doesn t give a shit if we end in a train wreck or a car crash if our story ends with a dot or dash if we were dust or ash because all we were is all well be and all we are is the in between of so far so good so forget every would could or should not forget remembering how we forgot live like a plot twist exists now and in memory because we burn bright our light leaves scars on the sun let no one say we will be undone by time s passing the memories we are amassing will stand as testament that somehow we bent minds around the concept that we see others within ourselves that self knowledge can t be found on bookshelves so who we are has no bearing on how we appear look directly into every mirror realize our reflection is the first sentence to a story and our story starts we were here 5","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"the night you were conceived your mum and dad had sex im not telling you something you dont already know im not telling you that butterflies taste with their feet its fact like during world war ii when days apart two german bombs were dropped on the british museum the second one passed through the hole made by the first one but neither bomb exploded just like that magical night with your mum and your dad its weird and freakish but it happened we dont like to think of our parents having sex it reminds me of the peanut butter and butter sandwiches my grandma used to make its gross but over the period of nine months cells divided and grew into something beautiful for all intents and purposes you were alone in the womb you may have shared the space with a brother or a sister but there was no one there to tell you this is going to hurt and it did and it does but it will always be a fond memory for your parents see ive known men who chew on tinfoil theyre put together like machinery encased in a skin of granite then chiselled by hard times into a callous but all of them will tell you every mechanical part of them breaks down the first moment they see their little son or daughter to quote every man ive ever known whos had a child it changes you and that makes me sad knowing that i will never know this change having discovered at an early age i can never have children i still work in terms of awesome time which is awesome but my junk is actually junk and it forces me to think of my life in a very final way that i will not continue after im gone so if i should die today tell the world the things i could never say as if by saying them now ive somehow said them time and time again as if yesterday was when i could say something to today that way the world could hear me as loud and as clear as the year the world discovered i was so far before my time that my time left me behind to remind time that im here today to say that maybe this time is mine me and failure we only ever speak sign language we have a limited vocabulary which means we disagree constantly and this is not to say ive never known failure ive taken her on double dates with embarrassment and humility during dinner we sit silently watching candles melt into sculptures of all the things weve never said but always felt ive got a black belt in the martial arts discipline of emotionally retarded but ive seen people open the lid on a can of worms that they use to bait a hook and go fishing for sympathy so i know im not alone in this im not the only one with problems and my problems are not unique so every time in the moment before im about to speak i remind myself to shut up and say something to bring myself to each conversation armed with mountains carved into pebbles and the true story of how and why i did it let people know that if my socks smell like shit its because ive been kicking ass all day i play two player conversations with total strangers for no other reason than to make them less strange we exchange stories like trading cards and are fine with the fact that weve always been rookies and weve never gone pro and im fine with the fact that i still dont know what i want to be when i grow up but today i want to be amazing tomorrow i want to bring you a piece of paper with the telephone number of a taxi cab company that knows the exact address of my arms so the day you need a hug im going to be there for that hear what you have to say without waiting for my turn to speak let you fall asleep for no other reason than to remind you its good to be tired it only means youre practicing for another dream and weve got to practice this is the reason snooze buttons were invented the reason we wake up and say five more minutes a dream is a rehab center for insomniacs i take naps because my parents told me you can be anything just follow your dreams so i practice knowing full well this will never make me perfect on a long enough timeline everyone fails success is not immortal there are times we bury it like a bone in the backyard digging deep down but along the way find that our fingers feature familiar facets thats found in the search parties we sent out seeking someplace suitable for it to rest the last words of success were and will always be the least we can do is everything so do it all as if lifes too short and youre too tall fall in love as many times as it takes so when the rest of the world wakes up you can say i got it right this time today im living proof that one guy whos never been into heavy lifting can still raise the roof i have loved this life i smile because i have tiny dreams that play hopscotch at the corners of my mouth and every time i breathe they float every time i laugh they fly kites ive spent late nights in hospitals watching ekg monitors realising my heart has a skyline and ive seen too many people who assign window washers to their eyes so they can watch their lives clearly pass them by which is why i try to mark even the most mundane memories into monuments that mark my times as something more than moments like november 21st 1999 walked into a coffee shop asked a girl out she said im busy till the next lunar eclipse so i left laughing knowing that only moments before i had just read an article stating that the next lunar eclipse would be on january 21st of 2000 two months away to the day coincidence no its spooky but we did end up going out and i had a great time up until i told her that story and she said thats crazy thats the kind of story you tell your kids there was no one there to tell me this is going to hurt and it did and it does it was and will always be a memory that reminds me i can never have kids so from time to time i have to be one come to this world armed with curiosity and amazement edit the unsent letters of my life into a one word statement yes yes to romantic flashlight lit dinners when youve run out of candles to handles on pillows so you can hold on to your dreams to the underdog dogsled teams who use angry cats instead of canines to landmines filled with confetti to the steady hands of friends who live like surgeons operating on our broken hearts building pacemakers from the spare parts of mercy we spend most of our figuring out what we dont want we haunt ourselves with regret because we almost always bet the odds we play it safe we waste time wondering what if were wrong what if we fail what if we lose what then well then youre a loser but youre not alone theres a legion of us who have been shot down on a long enough timeline everyone fails theres an entire universe made up of the unsent secret crush emails a hollow sky filled with the lost details of what it feels like to never know because we go about our lives never having tried feeling justified in our what if excuses what if he she them they that it what if it didnt and i ask what if it did the kid in me says yes to everything the love in me says shut up and say something 3","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"i got something and i don t know how to use it and if i m

memorize all that and the truth is the first girl i ever kissed tasted like tomatoes i know this because the second girl i ever kissed tasted like pepper it wasn t unpleasant it was just i was expecting tomatoes when i was a kid i learned that time slows near a black hole inside a black hole time stops all together whether or not this theory will ever be proved i am moved to believe this would be the perfect place to love someone in grade four my gym teacher gave me the nickname half ton it was a name that stuck i remember it because it was the first time i ever told someone go fuck yourself and meant it he quit calling me the name after he called my house trying to get me in trouble for what i d said to which my grandmother replied mr shithead i told him to say it i remember my grandfather s blue toolkit where he hid a secret stash of raisins i recall thinking my granddad has the worst taste in candy but he did teach me how to tie a tie my first opportunity to apply this knowledge was my first date a seventh grade classmate who showed up wearing acid washed jeans and a death leopard t shirt i wore a suit and tie when she asked why i was all dressed i had to think quickly and told her i thought it d be funny i don t wanna say it ended badly but she wound up leaving me for a boy who could make farting noises with his armpit i m forced to admit it was pretty cool in fourth grade my teacher had a rule about speaking out of turn failure to learn and practice this lesson would result in having to sit outside i know this because i tried it once when she finally came out to check on me she asked what was so important that it couldn t wait knowing that it s rude to point but needing to illustrate my position i gestured to her chest and said your boob is hanging out she quickly covered up and corrected me breast she was a good teacher when i was twelve i was given an academic diagnostics test the instructor later informed me i had an aptitude for history he looked puzzled when i replied yeah but that was yesterday and today i m more interested in tomorrow i remember it because the next day i asked a girl if i could borrow a pen when i offered it back she said you should write me a letter with it first so i did i wrote her a note which the teacher then intercepted and read to the class it was something we d learned in science that day about how the way gravity affects mass and weight in relation to how quickly something will fall example a crumpled ball of paper will fall at the same speed as a chunk of granite it doesn t matter how much something weighs it stays the same until you consider surface area and resistance at which point the persistence of gravity loses force example crumple a piece of paper into a ball it ll fall more quickly than a loose sheet they re both composed of the same mass and weight so you d think that the rate of velocity measured by the force of gravity would fall each to fall at the same speed but that s when you need to consider the greater surface area of the loose sheet adds resistance so the crumpled ball will fall quickly and the loose sheet will slowly float i wrote a note saying that when two people fall in love they do so at the same speed there s no need to factor in the physics explanations are something we can make no use of einstein once wrote gravity will not be held responsible for people falling in love i wrote a note saying if i fall in love with you no one will ever be able to explain it and i think that s beautiful despite the class laughing and she did as well which is how i can tell you that i then knew and now still know she tasted like tomatoes i don t remember the way every song goes i can t recall every person i ve ever met i get names mixed up all the time i m terrible with birthdays but i remember all the ways people have affected me how our stories became memories and if you re brazen enough to make one with me you re in there somewhere maybe it was a truth or dare kiss or a simple act of kindness one that reminded me to remember the moment and mark it as a memory so i could have it to look back on from this life i ve drawn conclusions so big that you can t fit into the tiny comic book boxes because i don t wanna risk losing the details just so i can make the story fit it s not a trick i remember how things felt which in turn makes me remember how things happened like my first attempt at skateboarding when i received a down to the bone skinned knee i remember a tree that looked like a man with huge arms trying to hold up the sky i used to try and climb to the top until one day i did and couldn t get down i remember the man with the brown car who tried to convince me he was sent to pick me up by my mom number one i lived with my grandparents number two you didn t know the safety word i recall when it finally occurred to me i m pretty fantastic it s not magic i remember because i make comparisons and not in terms of better or worse just different and not all of these memories are great but they re mine which lends weight to the belief that none are our lives are put together on an assembly line we re not prepackaged with emotions or programmed with stories we have to make our own and they all come batteries not included amid the endless opportunities we have daily seldom do we take the time necessary to pause to stop to record rewind and press play in our own way we are all ghetto blasters at top volume we consume silence with noise speakers pounding at our heartbeats as we write refund receipts for the broken eardrums of people that could hear us live we give of ourselves time precious because it s quality is limited only by your ability to live within it put yourself into every second of every minute and you will have a life worth remembering just because we don t have forever doesn t mean we have to move towards the end as if we re on a conveyor belt i feel nothing short of astonished when people ask me how do you memorize all that the fact is it s not a trick there s no fake curtain you need to pull away no little old man making it all work from behind a locked door you yourself probably remember when i told you before that near a black hole time slows inside a black hole is where i wanted to grow tomatoes","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"you used to say on a good day i only break his heart once that was before you learned to lie back when you used to tell him the truth cause you never had the kind of relationship that allowed for secrets but now somehow a lie fits better fits like a letter slipped through the slot of a locker because the doctor told you if there was anything more they could do they would do it he s not coming back and in the moment you knew it you learned how to lie because there are times when the cost of truth is so high that we in debt our own hearts to heartbreak we make love into a currency that can t be cashed in because there s never been a bank that will give out a loan based on the collateral of hope they ll lend anyone enough rope to hang their family s future on a rope then scheme some way to foreclose and everyone knows they have billions of dollars but no dads in their vault so you learned how to lie because it s not his fault that he can t remember that your mom his wife had a life that ended two years ago so you forged a passport into his heart trespassing into his past under the name of the last one to live there because healthcare can t cover the misplaced memories of families whose secrets spill out like jewels from the over sized holes in pants pockets that someone in the family has to wear and you tell me that every stitch is as valuable as every tear but pull a single string and the whole thing will unravel so you travel across borders under an assumed identity where the broken branch of a family tree is built into a confessional and you listen to an apology meant for your mother something about another woman on a night before a flight back home and you forgive him because that s what mom would do you know because he says thank you which means mom already did hid this secret away like one of those stray cats you used to keep hidden in your room hoping no one would ever know and you tell me i didn t mean to grow up it was an accident and i know you never meant to be 42 years old having to go through this having to miss him at the same time you re with him having him gone at the same time he s there having to stare at the first word you said and now not being able to say it and you can t remember despite your best efforts how or when the word daddy became dad how two extra letters had and have all the safety of weightlessness we both know this because you used to be my babysitter and when the nightmares would shake me awake you d make and take the time to tell me daddy s gonna be home soon because to us that word meant security or bravery or dear mr boogie man you better not be under my bed or in my closet because my daddy s gonna deposit his foot so far up your ass the interest alone will be enough for him to retire early we grew up in confessionals and were taught that a lie under any circumstance is wrong but how can the sacrifice of belong to anything less than the virtue it takes to break one s own heart to ease another s descent into madness how can anyone dismiss love as if it wasn t the only reason to risk everything knowing full well you can t bring them back that there are no footprints or trails to track to find them and all you can do is be there and you are despite your own husband you wear your mother s wedding ring because it was something he asked about when he saw you without it that was a bad day when you saw the way he couldn t understand how your hand held someone else s promise of forever and that s it s never you he will remember it s her and the only time you re sure he still loves you is when he asks how s your baby and may very well be that you break your own heart when you answer she s good sweetie she s happy","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"in second grade we did an experiment with static electricity we rubbed balloons on our heads and stuck them to walls and kissing you is kinda like that my hair stands on end i get shocked when i touch things and i want to tell you stupid stuff like kissing you is a bundle of kittens colliding with my face at point five miles an hour it s like being shot by a dart gun made of hummingbirds that shoots darts made of hummingbirds and your lips are so soft i can t actually tell when we re touching like braiding hair underwater or napping under a blanket filled with rainbows and clouds and your favourite books when you kiss me the cartoon devil and angel on my shoulders climb into my ears lick all my neurons and start fucking on my brain stem and if you were a 300 pound professional weight lifter and i were a kia sorento you could drag me anywhere with your lips kissing you is patient and impossibly slow like peeling paint off of a wall with glittery stickers or cooking a turkey with a lighter you remind me of the time when in second grade bethany hobcurk called me a freak face and stabbed me in the arm with a pencil cause kissing you is kinda like that unhealthy and will probably end in disfigurement but baby bring on the facial scars and lead poisoning cause when you kiss me you are dangling me off a bridge by my belt you are the screen door of my childhood all teeth and swinging so full of holes you can never keep anything in you are every black eye you are a semi truck and i am a turtle with two broken legs and a broken heart you are illegal fireworks falling downstairs together driving on four flat tires playing frisbee at night with a saw blade kissing you is like falling out of a 37 story window exploding into a cloud of robins and reappearing on the ground with my mouth full of feathers and when i can t kiss you i try to find the static electricity in my apartment i dig around in wall sockets i change lightbulbs with my teeth and i make out with the toaster and i know we ve only been seeing each other for a couple of

who made you someone who could make himself into someone she made you want to live more than anything else and now she makes you want to leave the world because you have seen it in her you have seen the color and shape of your perfect life and now the children the house the arguments about tableclothes are all fading like things left in sunlight like any dream left too long in the light for months maybe years everytime you see her you will want to kiss her when you do you will expect pain to come like the old dog you could never quite put down but there will be none you will remind yourself she will remind you you will remind each other that this is for the best that you are physically incapable of loving one another and in those moments you will be lying your heart screaming i
