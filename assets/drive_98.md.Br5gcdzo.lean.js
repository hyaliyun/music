right through him as if he wasn t there and in the mornin we both took a chance and ran and it was near the river bank when the ambush came on top of us and i d thought it was the end and we were had then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin through a bush and that big marine he just swatted it with his hand just like it was a fly  whoa camouflage things are never quite the way they seem whoa camouflage this was an awfully strange marine and i knew there was something weird about him cause when i turned around he was pullin a big palm tree right up out of the ground and swattin those charlies with it from here to kingdom come when he led me out of danger i saw my camp and waved goodbye he just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone and when i got back to my hq i told em

tellin the truth boy but this here is camouflage and he s been right here since he passed away last night in fact he s been here all week long but before he went he said semper fi and said his only wish was to save a young marine caught in a barrage so here take his dog tag son i know he d want you to have it now and we both said a prayer for a big marine named camouflage whoa camouflage things

eighteen nineteen twenty floors above the dark streets of the city dr light lived in a run down tenement an eccentric and brilliant man light was a loner a thinker a man of ideas ideas forbidden in wily s society the society for which he worked the society in which he lived the society that he would set free and so light worked far into the night when the watchful eyes of wily s robots weren t upon him he d set his skillful hands to the task of creating a device to bring about a change to create a machine to bring freedom to create a man to save the world twelve years light worked and on a cold night in the year 200x protoman was born a perfect man an unbeatable machine hell bent on destroying every evil standing between man and freedom built for one purpose to destroy wily s army of evil robots ready willing prepared to fight the streets the arteries of this metropolis run with bodies crowding together they flow out of the city toward a superstructure east of town a factory a fortress glancing at it the facade resembles the face of a skeleton smoke pours from the stacks high above the outer wall the gates are open a figure stands in the light before the entrance perfectly still he waits the crash of metal destroys the silence one by one the robots step forward step into the light cutman gutsman elecman bombman fireman iceman proto attack  the violence is surreal metal against metal the sound is deafening for most the reaction is automatic hands cover ears mothers reach to cover eyes of terrified children the blows are quick and precise this is protoman dealing death without remorse without hesitation and still the fight is unbalanced one against so many protoman fights without fear of defeat although it is inevitable the men keep their distance straining to see every crushing blow through the smoke that has surrounded the ongoing battle the din stops abruptly unsettlingly and as the smoke cleared wily rose above the countless robots remaining protoman was wounded low on energy struggling to remain standing as wily ordered the final attack the death of protoman the crowd had gathered there to watch him fall to watch their hopes destroyed they watched them beat him they watched them break him they watched his last defense deployed there was not a man among them who would let himself be heard but from the crowd from their collective fear arose these broken words we are the dead we are the dead what have we done what will we do where will we turn is there nothing we can do how did it come to this how did we go so wrong we are the dead","artist_name":""},{"lyrics":"35 years i lay awake at night across my mind is one eternal fight inventing new ways to think and see but keep old friends and answers to old ways to frontiers my

re in my town we don t like the play round got a call from the sheriff said he don t know what to do i told him dear sheriff you done called the right crew we re gonna save young rob and defuse the bomb and send that punk james home crying to his mom i called up gator i called up mike they ran over to my house quicker than the speed of light i said look guys this is our time that dumb jerk james done lost his dang mind he s got young rob hostage at the school yo it s morphing time lets annihilate this fool but my morpher wouldn t morph i made a fake one cause they were sold out at the store mike started laughing i said shut up stupid jerk let me use your morpher mine doesn t even work mike said bro this is for the red ranger just meet us at the school come on let s go gator i said for real you re really gonna leave man i can t believe this yo i thought we were a team gator said bro look we gotta go if we don t hurry up the playground is gonna blow i said fine i guess you re not my friends neither of you guys can ever come over again mike said fine hurry up dude run into the house and go and change into your suit i said good you guys are still my friends street rangers gotta stay united to the end i changed in 20 minutes flat when the town needs your help boy you gotta act fast but when i came out mike and gator were gone they left me a note that said i took too long they made it to the school just in the nick of time but it doesn t really matter cause they left their friend behind but anyways i m over that now it doesn t matter out of all three of us i m still the better rapper they re just jerks and they didn t even wait i guess having friends isn t all that great cause they ll turn their back on you every single time when your morpher doesn t morph and they
