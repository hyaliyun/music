for me but in the end her ideologies occupied the fortress of her heart i wrote her fifteen songs but still we had to part and if music was the food of love then i d be a fat romantic slob well music it s my substitute for love the last girl that i loved she was a low and lusty liar she set my heart on fire but made me choke her beauty was a sight to see but she didn t save it all for me i found other fires by following the smoke i wish that she had either cared for me or let me be but she chased me from my mind and from my home i wrote her sixteen songs but i ended up alone and if love is really all that we need then even all my singing is never gonna save me music it s my substitute for love well i ve had many different girls inside my bed but only one or two inside my head these days i cuddle up to my guitar instead but oh what i would give not to stumble but to really fall in love and i could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to

or a dream roll river roll we gotta wash these tears away i wanna face you don t wanna never be afraid and when the rivers subside and the saplings rise will we make a better choice than before or are we bound to remake all the same mistakes once more four sisters floated about on a raft fashioned out of the splintered remains of their home they were cast out to sea by a storm wild and free and left to drift in the doldrums alone one had brought silver and another had gold and a diamond so big it took two hands to hold and the third had a brush and some lipstick and blush to apply was her plan at the first sight of land but the fourth sister wept for there was nothing she had kept of the broken world they left behind she wept for the three for even now they weren t free as she gazed upon them one last time and as they squabbled and fought over who had owned what she said her goodbyes silently and she tiptoed away on the crest of a wave and the rest were buried in the sea they were buried in the heart of the sea roll river black water swallow the tears from the sky rise higher for 40 nights and for 40 days we re gonna have to learn to live a better way roll river roll we gotta wash this whole place clean and make the city like it never was a faded memory or a dream roll river roll we gotta wash these tears away i wanna face you don t wanna never be
